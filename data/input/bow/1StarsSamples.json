The west side location was way better. After they shut down I started going to this one. The food isn't as good and the fresh made tortillas are always either hard, cold, or burnt. Half the time I'm there they screw up my order. One time there was a miscommunication between the waitress and my boyfriend which ended up costing us $7. It wouldn't have been that big of a deal if the manager at first told the waitress to tell us she wasn't there and when she did finally come out she didn't apologize, make any effort into making the situation any better, and then started repeating the same thing over and over again so we'd shut up. A couple of my friends and I have decided to never go back here. Hopefully the west side one will open up again.Nice people. Not enough staff to accommodate walk-ins that they advertise for. Pretty sure Andy (technician) does not know how to do shellac. Didn't have all the bottled products. But said each product line is different. Placed my hands in the drier and the polish bubbled and my hands began to sting. I said I don't think this right seeing that I've had shellac done before. He said just put the tips of your fingers in. Still in pain I declined to go further and asked to have it removed.Will NEVER take our dog here again. Our dog spent two nights here and I can't believe the damage that was done in that time. Upon pick up we asked how she had done, and were told, "She's on Facebook!" (which she wasn't...) but weren't given any legitimate information. What actually had happened was that ALL of her gums were bruised and her teeth were covered with metal from chewing on a cage for 2 days straight. The next week at home she cried in pain when she played with any chew toys. She had lost a noticeable amount of weight (in 2 DAYS) so who knows if she was fed. He nose was swollen and there was a quarter sized wound on the top of her nose. When we asked the staff who walked her out to us what happened he had no idea. 

Having our fun-loving happy dog be visibly terrified walking out to us and not even looking up to see who we were until she could smell us upset me us so much. If you love or care about your dog spend the extra 5 dollars for a place that cares about animals.Bag was stolen by a store employee while I sat and listened to my iPad eating lunch. Caught on video, store manager and owner covering up the situation. Police are now involved and detective investigating the video. Store employee never reported anything to a manager and cleaned out my bag in a cleaning closet in the store. 

Homeless use this location as a sanitation station. Be prepared to be asked several times for money. 

Homeless change clothes right in the store.the arizona center is to phoenix as the galleria is to scottsdale.  can you say white elephant?I had to be admitted for a stomach infection. The 3-day stay was a living nightmare, and traumatic experience.

They rudely wake you up every day at 3am to do blood work. What sadistic monster would conceive of doing this to their patients at such ungodly hour? How completely unnecessary, and when I questioned the reason for the early rise, I only received non-answers and mean stares. 

Their solution to every problem is to give people a pill. And doctors are way too quick to prescribe them . You can't sleep, here's a pill. Well, if I wasn't interrupted 3-4 times a night I would be able to have a good night's sleep without the unnecessary assistance of a sleep hypnotic. 

Do you fell depressed in a hospital? Of course we all do. Here's a pill to you. Instead of treating your patients better, just fill them up with more pills.

Is your stomach hurting? Here's a pill. Of course it'll mask the pain but it will not make the cause of  your illness better. 

This is a teaching hospital that caters mostly to indigents and low-income patients. For people with insurance, such as myself, it was a horrific experience. By the way, I had a strange feeling I was a guinea pig for their students.

Your health is the most precious gift, beware of this hospital as they do not respect you as a human being. Some of the nurses are nice, but there were some that looked at you with extreme hatred. Their night RN supervisor reminded me of Nurse Ratched. She gave me the creeps.

Thankfully, I have only needed to stay in a hospital 3 times in my life. The first 2 times were for giving birth to my children in the late 1970's.  What I've learned from this current experience is that the state of medical care in this country has definitely declined to shocking lows.   

When I asked for a doctor's note to give to my employer, they were curt, dismissive and vengefully would not provide me with one. 

Banner Good Samaritan is by far one of the worst experiences I've had in my life. It has left me shaken to the core.I write this review for the people who are in my position, and if you dont understand why SOME people are made to go here for petty offenses dont read this and judge because you dont understand what bullshit it is. The people who work here are cool and respectful and I understand its their "job" to run this place, but in reality its just another stunt by the government to rob people of their money and time. Most everyone assigned to this program cant even afford it which puts them in a even worse situation. The goverment pulls this crap cuz they know they can and piss people off more which in turn makes most situations worse. For the people who can relate for getting in "trouble" for the smallest thing and have to at least pay $1,500 to get something small off your record is complete shit.What's with long lines to get breakfast! Very disappointing.I will never order flowers through Cactus Flowers again.  I ordered flowers online to be delivered on Saturday 2/11 for a friend's mom for her birthday.  They delivered without the personalized card.  My order confirmation clearly shows the message I had written for her.  She had to call Cactus Flowers twice to figure out who they were from and the employee she spoke to was incredibly rude to her.   Also the flowers did not look like what I had ordered.  In the picture there are purple flowers which they just left out completely.  I called Cactus Flowers the next day, Sunday to try and figure out what happened.  Even though I had my order number, it still took her 10 minutes to find my order.  Apparently the flowers had come out of their Carefree location so if I wanted them to deliver a new bouquet, she would call that location to make sure they had all the flowers that were supposed to be in it.  She said she would call me back and let me know.  I had a missed call from them later in the day but no voicemail.  It took me until THursday to get back in touch with them due to my work schedule and the fact that....wait for it.....they have no voicemail.  What kind of business operates with no way for anyone to leave them a message?

So on Thursday I finally reached them and spoke to someone else and she told me that they would redeliver Friday or Saturday.  Guess what, it didn't happen!  I called back yesterday and spoke to someone who was less than pleasant and she said she would have a manager call me back today.  It is now 3:00 and I haven't heard from anyone.  I'm sure I will have to call them back, again.  I don't think I have ever experienced such crappy customer service.  It actually takes effort to suck as much as they do.  

Moral of this story:  Do not use Cactus Flowers.  I will return to using Pro Flowers as I have never had any issues with them.Went for dinner on a Tuesday at 7 pm (July 1). Their own website says they are open until 10 pm. Their voice message on their phone says the same. Drove 30 minutes to have a meal here. Later a friend pointed out their Facebook page says they are closed for the week (4th of July week). Ridiculous to update one place and leave others unchecked.  Waste of my time to try a new place.  Won't bother coming back if they can't communicate adequately.I always give the benefit of the doubt, but so far this has been an awful experience with this office. My son was fitted 2 months ago for an AFO splint (these are time sensitive due to growth). We have called only to be given the runaround, sent to voicemails, and never have return calls. Then they blame it on our insurance company not approving it until a month after fitting. We were mailed an approval letter from our insurance company before that- which proves someone at the office is falling down in their job to follow up! Despite that, we waited again. Now, 2 months later and numerous phone calls (even from our PT), I only got a hold of someone today. After having to "search" for information- she called back (which was a surprise unto itself) and guess what?! It's there! It's a miracle! Who knows how long it has been sitting there. Severe lack of organization, courtesy, and good service at this office!Wow. One of the worst meals I've had in awhile.

My husband and I came here for some Chicken Fried Steak because he went about 3 years ago and said it was awesome. We showed up and knew that we wanted to order the Chicken Fried Steak right away. They took our order, we waited shortly and our salad came out. Wasn't the best salad. Wasn't really fresh..had a lot of ranch on it, but I can see how somebody might like it. Ate some of it and pushed it to the side.

Soon our steak arrived. I was so excited to try it! I took my first bite and was shocked to find that it was completely bland. I added some salt and ate some more. The meat wasn't the best, which I understand because it's chicken fried steak, however it tasted frozen to me. After the 4th bite, I had to ask my husband if it tasted the same as before. He shook his head no and commented on how disguising it was. Even the mashed potatoes were bland. I agreed and started to feel gross thinking about eating any more of it.  

We both pushed out dishes to the side, with lots of food still left on our plate. When our waitress came by about 10 minutes after she dropped the food off, we told her we were done. She asked if we wanted a box, which we declined, but otherwise no questions or concerns - she didn't even seem to notice that we ate almost nothing off of our plates. Didn't feel like bringing it up at the time, so we just paid our $35 for and left. I hate KFC and I would much sooner eat that than eat here again..Damn, I thought after all the hoopla this place was supposed to have the BEST chicken fried steaks in Phoenix....IT DOESN T...now I m from Texas and in all my 62 years , i have not had a more greasy,soggy,limp chicken fried steak....YUCK...what a load of crap this thing was. The rest of the place was a  dump..the bathroom had to be shared with employee changing his clothes...small is the word...I would bet you if Gordon Ramsey or the health dept inspected this dump the kitchen would be closed first thing....save your money and time, go back to Texas every now and then, go to the Market Diner on Harry Hines in Dallas and eat a REAL GOOD chicken fried  steak with fresh cream gravy and not that congealed goo from the texaz GRILL...I have had better from roadside vendors but nothing worse than the imitation chicken fried steak this place serves instead.....lazy @#$%'sI just experienced this restaurant for the second time.  My first time around, the food and service were decent and the nifty sushi dessert made the overall experience pretty cool. 

The second time around, it was pretty horrendous.  My boyfriend and I were driving around trying to find a place on which we could both agree.  I was craving sushi, and he's not crazy about sushi.  Ultimately, Moto came to my mind--because they have some basic sushi rolls (although no raw salmon or really much raw nigiri to speak of) along with lots of other food. 

So, Moto it was.  On arrival, as we walked up, we noticed a couple of empty tables inside so we weren't too worried about having to wait.  But, when we got inside, the host basically just pointed at a table at the bar, had us sit down, and then threw two menus onto the table and walked away. 

As we sat at a table in the bar area--although we wanted to eat in the actual restaurant area--my boyfriend immediately noticed that the couple sitting behind us was completely hammered.  I listened for a moment, and indeed, they were screaming.  Screaming their conversation.  And they were discussing herpes sores.  They appeared to be on a date, discussing herpes sores, and the female occasionally mentioned her DAUGHTER.  

So after listening to some loud herpes convo for a few moments, my boyfriend went and asked the host if they had a different table, inside the actual restaurant portion.  We were added to a list.  

About 5 minutes later, a waitress approached, and I'm 99.9% sure that she was intoxicated.  Not just slightly inebriated, either, but kind of ridiculous drunk.  She looked all glazed over as she asked if we wanted any drinks.  I asked if they had a drink menu and she stared at me like she was really confused.  Then I asked if they had a cocktail menu, and she said, no, we have a menu of beer and wine.  She gave me a weird look.  So, thinking I was mistaken about the drink situation, I asked, do you guys have a full bar? 

She said, oh, yes!  What do you like!?!?  I like fruity drinks, so I asked if they had Stoli Razzberri (or however it's spelled).  She said, "I LOVE THAT.  THAT'S MY FAVORITE."  Then she informed me that she wasn't sure if they had it, but she would check.  My boyfriend (who was driving) requested a water, and the waitress walked away. 

Eventually after enduring more conversation about that chick's kid and various human ailments (herpes, chicken pox, the flu), the host told us they had a table for us.  He walked us to the table and threw menus on it.  As he started to walk away, I mentioned to him that I had ordered a drink from the waitress at the other table and I didn't want her to wonder where we went.  He said he'd already told her about it, and not to worry.  A few seconds later, he brought the drink over and set it down.  Oddly, the drink was pink, and a Stoli Razz & tonic isn't usually pink.  But I figured it looked interesting so I'd give it a shot anyway.  

Shortly thereafter, our actual waitress approached.  She immediately started LECTURING us about how we can't just order drinks at the bar and walk away without cashing out at the bar.  She went on for a while about how we needed to go back and cash out at the bar.  We explained that we never meant to sit at the bar, and that we had just gotten our drink at our actual table, and hadn't received it at the bar.  So then she kind of backed off after saying something weird, like, "Oh, so you just got them?  Oh, okay, then you guys aren't too worried about it then I guess."  Then she started telling me about the drink I'd received, which wasn't the one that I ordered--it was some other type of vodka with actual fruit in it or something.  Then she gave me a long list of all the other types of fruit vodkas that they have.  I guess that was ok, and the drink ended up being pretty decent.  But it was still just....bizarre. 

Anyway, we ordered our food.  That included a shrimp tempura roll, a squid salad, a regular sized order of the asian nachos, and a buffalo burger.  

The shrimp tempura roll and squid salad came out first.  I'm an idiot who's terrible with chopsticks, and I didn't notice that we had no forks until the waitress was gone.  It took a while to obtain a fork.  But anyhow, the squid salad was pretty decent, typical for any sushi restaurant.  The roll was....ok.  The crab mix in it was kind of like what you could get in a crab salad sandwich at Subway.  It also had carrots in it, which were kind of overwhelming.  

Then, out came the asian nachos.  The gigantic asian nachos.  She brought us a large instead of the regular that I ordered, and of course, charged us for the large.  I considered saying something, but I figured we'd just get a lecture.  We were only able to finish a small portion of them, because the large was freaking huge.  Fortunately they were good.  

Maybe we misread, but the buffalo burger was made with buffalo, not buffalo sauce.  

Moto is not very good.Decent wash, sloppy dry. They had my car for 1hr 40min and still did not manage to find time to dry the car nor finish wiping down the inside. I don't know if they don't have enough employees or the employees they do have just don't care but, they took my money and delivered a piss poor product and did so in an extremely lengthy fashion. Will not be returning to this rip off spot again.The only thing less fresh than their 1980's decor was the food on their buffet.

Walk in and you will be greeted by an eccentric person in a leisure suit, you can either go in the glass doors with acrylic handles or in to the mirrored room with zebra booth and old conference table chairs. No this is not a gentlemen's club it is a a restaurant that just lacks windows. 

For Mother's day they had a buffet only setup, and what mom does not love cold food that has been sitting out for an undetermined  amount of time. The croutons in the Cesar salad were soggy as were the crustinni under the bruchetta. The pasta was cool. Even worse the butter soaked farm raised salmon cubes were just luke warm. The vegetables were mush and again just luke warm. The mozzarella in the caprese on the buffet was not made in house as it was firm and flavorless. 


The real amusing part was on the dessert section. There was a plate of items straight from Costco, lemon bites, cookies and cinnamon twists just as you would by at Costo, on a plate and picked over.  

This is one relic that is better left in the past, horribly dated decor, sub par food at high prices means this place should be avoided.We went to lunch here for the first time after passing by it 100s of times, we went on a tuesday afternoon at 12:30, it was busy but not too crowded. 

This place is NOT vegan friendly in the least, all of the sandwiches have some sort of dairy in them as do the soups. You can make your own sandwiches but I can make a sandwich with cold veggies or sauteed veggies with mustard at home. I would suggest offering grilled zucchini/eggplant with a sauce that is dairy free. 

All of the sandwiches are placed in sacks with plastic utensils and styrofoam cups, even if you eat in. This is not eco friendly, my pasta with marinara (which I can make at home) came in a nice plastic to-go container. While I realize this is not a restaurant per say, it would be nice if they had real forks/knives and plates if you plan to eat in and get something more ecofriendly than styrofoam. 

I did ask if they recycled before we left, and was told that the kitchen does, which is great! However, there is not a recycling container in the restaurant for the sacks/utensils or pasta to-go packages. 

I will not be returning to this non vegan friendly, non planet friendly sandwich shop and would not recommend it.You'd think with its proximity to the chi-chi yuppieville that is Arcadia, this Target would be... well... not so ghetto. This one is actually worse than the one at Christown (oh, excuse me, "Spectrum") Mall, and that's saying something. We'll be saving this location for emergencies only.Complete and utter rip off!  I bought tires from them, had a flat and they were going to charge my $25 to fix it!  I called Discount Tire and they fixed it for free.  Imagine that, a company that will fix another company's problem and for no charge!  

The other problem I had with this place was that they wanted to charge me $125 to read the fault codes off of my truck when your local auto parts dealer will do this for free!  

Everything about this place irks me and they prey on people who are not auto savvy and they have gotten away with it for so long.  Please stay away from this place as they are way too expensive and will probably be the place to sell you something you do not need if they have the chance.My husband and I ate at Carlos O'Brien's last night; to our dismay, the food was inedible.  It was a disappointing evening since we do not go out to dinner very often since the recession.

I ordered the Carlos Carnitas Dinner.  The pork tasted dried, rubbery, and days old.  Between us, we ate three bites of it and put it aside.  My husband's dinner, Pollo Fundido, was not any better.  The pollo fundido was over salted and made with poor quality ingredients; the chicken appeared to have come from a can versus fresh, and the cheese tasted processed versus real.  We only ate a couple of bites of it and sadly called it a night, going home to eat bowls of cereal for dinner instead.Completely inedible.  Some people say the price is right, but I say you get what you pay for.  I would have rather been served dog food... at least then I would have known what it was.  Servers couldn't even open bottles of wine.  I certainly wouldn't use this company.I called because i had a weird looking valve stem, and asked the guy who answered the phone if i could send him a picture of it from my phone. He told me no because he didnt know or trust me. I find that pretty ridiculous and bad customer service.They are lucky leaving 0 stars is not an option. This place ruined my DRY cleaning. I need to emphasize DRY because they washed the items i brought to them.. not only did they wash my items.. which are now color stained and washed out in areas.. they also creased (pic attached) items that clearly have a NO CREASE tag... with sooooooo much starch the pant legs were literally glued together. I have never had my things ruined or had such a piss poor job done on my dry cleaning before. Im a little shocked still.. when people drop things off and entrust a business with their personal items, to do a job that is ... oh i dont know... on the huge neon sign above their door!!! I believe i should be able to trust them to properly do the things theyre advertising for... .... ffs.   If you value your clothes... go somewhere else.My girlfriend and I ate here recently and I get nauseas thinking about this place.

I ordered a seafood dish with noodles and veggies. The scallops were still very cold in the center. The little corncobs (cant think of the name) tasted stale in my dish as well as my girlfriends. I could only eat a few bites and I had to quit. 

I hate complaining when I go places and I should have said something to them, but instead I will simply not return and let others know to avoid this place. Simply put, the food sucks and this place needs to close.We got married at the Legacy Ballroom.  The venue is beautiful however the Mangement Team sucks.  We booked the Legacy Ballroom a year in advance of our wedding - the management team changed three different times.  When I arrived on our wedding date the drapes in the ballroom were missing. They sent the drapes out for cleaning and they got damaged. They "replaced" the drapes with ugly black drapes that didn't go with the theme of our wedding.  We chose the Legacy Ballroom because the decor and color scheme matched with our wedding theme.  Additionally, we secured our rehearsal date a year advance; they changed the date on us (which we were ok with) but when we arrived on the resceduled date - the ballroom was occupied with another venue as such we had our wedding rehearsal outside.  I spoke to Bob who manages the Ballroom (currently) he promised to issue credit and back pedal on his words.  I am currently flighting the charge with the Legacy Ballroom.  I would not recommend doing business with the Legacy Ballroom.  Lovely location and venue but the management SUCKS!  I have reported the Legacy Ballroom to the Better Business Bureau with the hopes that no one will do business with them and they will be forced to close their doors or clean up their act.I understand the hassles.

Its annoying when all you want is a $10 car wash and every time they want to charge you for any number of sealants and crap.  And "no thank you" isn't good enough.  They have to give you their situational anecdotes and keep hassling.  Go to Danny's, they understand that no means no.I wish they could give negative stars.  I mean seriously this place is a health violation.  I have eaten Mexican food on the streets of Tijuana and almost never has it been this bad.  Gordan Ramsey needs to put this place on kitchen Nightmares.  Honestly, I joined Yelp just so I could post a review of how bad this place is.  I am not even joking when I say the marg tasted like it was made with a mixing powder like Koolaid.  I have never, ever, ever walked out without finishing my food.  I can say after 4 bites we were out the door.  Help others and warn them that this place is toxic.Update: Management called to appologize for all th RATS running around and said he'd send me a coupon for our next visit. It never came. Surprised? Not really.
    
RATS!!! The wife and I stopped for quatro de Mayo and were halfway through our Quesadilla when I looked to my left and a BIG rat was sitting under the table next to us. As soon as i made a gesture towards him he ran back into the outdoor stainless bar/storage or whatever it is. OK, she was freaked out but I said, "hey, we're on the patio so &%#$ happens and told the waitress when she came back who was also a bit freaked out especially when I told her how big it was. This was no freakin' mouse. A few minutes later our food came out and as we were engaged in the act of eating... here came another big freaking rat who ran right under our table and out hole in the wall. I once again told the server who was a bit freaked out and started looking around as she went back to wherever she came from. Never did any management staff come out to apologize or maybe offer to move us or something so we finished most of our meal and hit the road. I've been frequenting Macayo's for years but this and the fact that the food quality isn't consistent has ensured we won't frequent this establishment any time soon. We also planm to let everyone we know about this. I've lived here all my life so that's quite a few peopleSo yeah the manager of this store printed out my review to show my mother last time she went in. LMAO SERIOUSLY WHO DOES THIS?

Basically I get bullied through the entire hair experience and then my mother comes home complaining that now she feels uncomfortable because they were unhappy with my review. So I'm assuming they were trying to bully me into taking this down? Well, take that as you will. Any company that tries to bully you into taking down a poor review is completely unprofessional in MY opinion.

As for Wendy apparently she feels really bad about the job and showed remorse (I would too after reading my review) so I'm posting my UPDATE to say that my hair actually wasn't VIRGIN. I had some box color and that might be why it came out so yellow. That still has nothing to do with the fact that I didn't want streaks or that kind of dye job. She still should have just told me no. She has since apologized for it which is very respectable and professional on her part.

But of course those are such tiny details that are now corrected but overshadowed by the fact that the owner printed out my review as if he was in high school and tried to bully me into taking it down by showing my mother. Hello, I'm an adult and I'm entitled to my opinion. I may be a lot of things but I am not a liar. The owner has also told my mothers friend who recommended her to the place trying to pit them against each other. I seriously can't believe that the owner of a business would pull this high school drama and embarrass two of his long term customers like this. 

I feel horrible for my mother because she should be able to retain a business relationship as a paying customer without being hassled about her daughters opinion of the place.I hate being so mean about a Jo-Ann's but I am DONE with the registers. 

I make decisions to NOT come here because the lines are so ridiculous. Why do they have 9 registers and 1 person ringing ALL THE TIME!!! Infuriating.  Plus, I feel like I ALWAYS have to interrupt the cashier because the only people working at Jo-Ann's are 1 cashier and 2 people cutting fabric. I have never in my 10+ times in this store seen an associate who is not in one of those three positions.  It is SO maddening!!!

Bring on AT LEAST one more associate because at least I can find help at Michaels, and if I can't find it there, I'd rather buy my item on Amazon to avoid the BULLSH*T at Jo-Ann's.

P.S. I even have a vested interest in this store as I took a sewing and a cake decorating class here and I am tired of the place sucking so bad.AWFUL! To call this a steakhouse is laughable. Best I can say is mediocre over priced nursing home food. Staff approached us as if we were lucky to be there. Went with pre teens, too noisy to chat and not a one in my party enjoyed their food. Waste of time and money.Don't let the fancy façade fool you: This is the saddest, dingiest, most disappointing Goodwill I have ever visited.

Ever spot a cute guy or girl from across the room, then you get up close and they've got a unibrow, halitosis, and aren't actually wearing pants? This is that Goodwill.Everything is super beat to hell. no new stuff. All beat 70s and 80s rock stuff. condition is bad. Staff is annoying and I've seen them over at the Tempe zia raiding the bins for stuff to mark up. I would skip the trip.Golds Gym SUCKS!!

Manager told me he was going to cancel membership,  failed to do so.
He doesn't even have the balls to call me.  What a pussie!!!!!!!!!!!!!Upon walking into the office I was a bit perplexed. I thought I was entering a free clinic. I'm still not sure. My appointment was for 1pm. I wasn't seen until 1:50pm. Had I been that late they would have cancelled my appointment. Nonetheless I saw Bryan Monson, at least I think it was Bryan Monson, perhaps it was (Silver Surfer: Can enter Hyperspace. tied Nova He can enter Hyperspace as well. tied Green Lantern)the whole appointment lasted 1 minute 35 seconds. He referred me to  Dr. Garcia in the office for surgery. Explained it for about 15 seconds to my daughter. I guess I'm too old to understand and was out like a shot. Yeah, errr won't be going back. No thanks for the Botox.If I could give this store negative stars, I would.  I went in there on Sunday to shop for some pants for my daughter.  She is short and wide (she has down syndrome) and there are some pull on pants with pockets that she loves there, deep pockets for her cell phone.  We find 4 pair of pants in her size (amazing in itself), I got an article of clothing , and I got a printer cable.  As usual, there were only 3 cash registers open (on a sunday at noon)  so we go through the help yourself aisle.  Line moves fast and I notice that that there is a person standing right in the middle of the do it yourself lines ringing people up also, so as it's my turn, I can either pick a do it yourself or go to her, so I go to her (don't like the do it yourself).  I have 6 items, 4 exactly the same.  She tell me "you have too many items, I can't help  you."  Really, 6 items is too many for you?  So as usual, poor customer service in this store.  So I turn around, and of course every one of the do it yourself registers are now full.  So not only can she not help me, because I have 6 items (too many for her little Walmart brain to handle) but I now get to stand in line again.  I walked.  I have had very poor customer service in this store again and again, and I keep coming back.  This was the last straw.  I  have also written Walmart, and I bet you money that I will never hear from them.  It's all about volume for this company, they could really give a shit about customer service.  As long as all the people come to their stores and spend money, that's all this corporation cares about.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from Walmart.  I know they are less expensive that Safeway, but not at the expense of your sanity, and if you expect anything resembling customer service, you won't get it here.  STAY AWAY!I was greeted warmly. The menu items were explained well and I was even offered a sample when I couldn't decide what salad dressing to get.  The salads that were being prepared looked pretty delicious! Time to pay...

Before ringing me up, I informed the cashier that I had a Groupon to use. She said I had to have a voucher printed out. Then, she showed me a handwritten post it next to the employee phone that stated coupons must be originals, not from an email or phone. She told me it must say that on my Groupon... So I showed her. She said to me, "See! You need to follow the directions and it says 1. Print Groupon." I kindly showed her the following statement which says, "(or pull it up with our mobile app)."  She said, "I don't know how to do that. It probably is for a Phoenix location. THIS is not Phoenix." Duh, I knew where I was... exactly where the Groupon directions led me! LOL. 

Anyhow, we went back and forth for a bit and she rang me up. I told her I wasn't going to get anything and she was livid... She called me rude for ordering and walking away. That's not exactly how I see it happening. She told me that she has never heard of a company giving a discount without proof of a voucher, that it would be like giving something away. Huh... sigh. 

So basically my review is about customer service and not the food as I didn't get a chance to try it. Generally, Quiznos is pretty tasty too. :-(I would not recommend this place if it was the last place to stay at!! We needed a cheap month to month place while we were buying our house no contract .. What we should have done was rented a apartment for the four months (we ended up staying two and going to an apartment month to month for the other..... We were on the ground floor and at night needed to put a towel under the door because of the roach problem not to mention the notice from other guests.. We got one coffee pouch when we first checked in but When we asked for more they told us no and that the towels were only delivered once a week when they came to clean unless we went to front desk which was fine until our personal towels went missing and were replaced by theirs ... They never did find our towels ... And insisted we not be there when they cleaned our room... Hmm wonder why... I'll quit rambling save your money and stay else where or get a cheap month to month apartment!Why am I the first to review this place? It's been on the map for as long as I can remember and it's been the same icky, weird staff and "just okay" Japanese food for just as long. 

In any case, it makes a compelling case as as nicer than average restaurant. It's a large building and has all the hallmarks of a great Japanese eatery. Sushi bar, live seafood you can choose yourself, and management that hires native Japanese to serve you. All signs point to greatness!

Somewhere between the Greatness road sign and the arrival at actual Greatness, someone seems to have taken Mr. Potential and kicked his teeth in before repeatedly punching his groin and laughing as he robbed him of his money. 

Let me explain:

I have give this place repeated chances to show me that it's worth the real estate it's planted on and repeatedly I have felt like Mr. Potential must have felt after his beating. 

I've been there with groups, alone, on dates and each time it's either inattentive or rude wait staff and middling food that isn't anywhere near the price of admission.

The last (and final) time I went to Ichi Ban (ironically meaning Number 1 in Japanese HA!) I took my girlfriend of a year as a treat for both of us. Why did I go here? You ask a good question and I have no acceptable answer other than I may have subconsiously wanted to break it off with Sandie (I now have nick-named her "The Sand Demon" - say it out loud. It makes sense... seriously. Sand Demon... Sandie... but I digress) and this was a perfect way to do it. 

The food was once again quite bad and to add insult to injury, after delivering our food our waiter began his assault. 

Upon finding out I speak fluent Japanese, he switched entirely over to speaking Japanese. Leaving me to translate everything into English for the Sand Demon. As if that weren't bad enough, he began asking me if she was "a dirty girl" because she sure looked like one to him. 

I couldn't believe what he was asking me and definitely wasn't going to translate it for Sand Demon, but just in case I misunderstood him, I asked him to explain what he meant. He went on about how she had a nice rack and long legs and that she just looks like a good time in the sack. 

Some people might view this as a compliment in some way, but I usually don't have kind words for a guy who tells me my girlfriend looks whorish and a good lay. I told him in my most polite Japanese that he'd never get the chance to find out since he most likely couldn't get laid in a brothel and we left. 

At the time it wasn't funny, but it's pretty funny now. Sure, he was being rude but in retrospect she was kind of a whore. But there's no review area for ex's by the name of Sand Demon so that's all I'll say about that... for now.Stopped in here today and figured I would give it a try as I pass it all the time. First thing is the smoking section is right in front of the place so you have to walk through it to get inside. I get splitting migraines from cigarette smoke so I had to hold my breath. once in side there was a sign saying please seat your self.  so we did and figured they did not see us come in because it took for ever to get service. the booth was dirty, and the window sill had a inch layer of dust, with some old fries and about five dead flies on it. it took forever for the food to come, which is odd because there was only five people in the place and three outside smoking. the food was nothing to brag about just plain bleh. Not sure how they stay in business must have cheap drink on the lounge side and if you are wasted you don't care about the rest. place should shut down.Wow. I'm not even going to wait until I'm done before leaving a review. I just placed my order, 30 minutes after sitting down.

11:35 - Sit at a table for 8 an order drinks. So far so good.

11:39 - Things were going alright when we had a table of 8, but when a few more people showed up to attempt to give Floridino's some money in return for a quick lunch, all hell broke loose.

11:41 - There was a room next to us with a bunch of empty tables. "You can't sit in there. We don't have a server in there." Screw it, we picked up our drinks and moved in. If they can serve us at that table, they can serve us one table over in this other room.

11:45 - We asked to see the manager.

11:50 - "We can get you drinks in here, but not food. We have to wait for a table to open up out there. Then we can serve you."

11:52 - Someone who looks like a manager peeks into the room and leaves. We still haven't spoken to a manager...

11:55 - "We don't want to overwhelm the kitchen." (Hmm.. If you didn't want to "overwhelm" the kitchen, maybe you should have taken my order 20+ minutes ago...)

12:05 - They're taking our food orders in the Forbidden Room. I guess they're not as allergic to accepting our money as they led us to believe.

12:32 - Just received my food in the Forbidden Room. Pretty much exactly an hour after I got here.

You suck, Floridino's.The coconut shrimp is tasty.  The tuna salad is really good.  However, most of the menu can be acquired at Red Lobster for about the same price and even better quality.  There is virtually nothing on the menu for a vegetarian.  I would not recommend this place to someone craving seafood, as the quality and freshness are questionable.  Go to Red Lobster instead!We'll that do I have to say... Once you walk in you get hounded by the workers., 1st when you walk in then like 3 in the middle of the store then like 3 cashiers in  the back . Like I know customers is good but they take it to the next level, when I get attacked by the workers I just want to tell them to leave me alone , when I go shopping In there I have my head phone on and volume up so they won't bug me I have walked out a few time and just bought what I need online just to stay away from the pushy workers ,Terrible service waited for 20 minutes to receive my food.... getting my brother a refill and asked for a water cup the manager accused me of stealing a fountain beverage because I was refilling my brothers drink BEYOND the word of ridiculous and then he verified with multiple cashiers and told them to add the drink to my sisters bill who was order so RUDE finally to add insult to injury he came by the table to make sure I was drinking water!!!!! While all this was happening there was a guy eating a large plate of sliced oranges that are intended for the ice tea NEVER AGAIN WILL I RETURN!!!!I have no intentions of returning to this business ever again! 

My father-in-law previously  came here for watch repairs, so he recommended this spot to us since we were in the area, and I was anxious to have my new watch sized. 

I told the sales clerk to take a few links off my new watch. She didn't bother to size the watch on me to determine the appropriate number of links to take off, and she ended up taking too many links off from one side, making the watch hang to far to one side on my wrist (if that makes sense). I was only slightly annoyed at this point, so I asked her to correct it and she argued that she did it correctly, but to appease me she put one link back on so the watch would sit right on my wrist. She then rang up my service purchase and told me the total was $14.95....for two minutes of work! I assumed the cost would be $5 - $10 to take out some watch links, but not $15!?!? I asked the lady why the cost was so high,  and she claimed that the charge was "industry standard." Not knowing any better, I paid the charge and left feeling completely dooped! 

I was a little suspicious of her claim that $15 is "industry standard" to remove watch links, so I called around and got a few estimates from other local jewelers  and not one jeweler quoted me a price over $10.Can you believe that!...So not only did she lie to me, but I didn't get quality service. If you go to this jeweler make sure your quoted a reasonable price before they perform the work or service.Has this place gone down hill.  My wife and I went there around noon.  Only two other people there hmmm. Tell you something! Well she ordered a BLT with their potatoes. I order a pancake and bacon.  Let me say the waitress and manager were competent and nice.  BUT competence includes bringing food to a table that looks correct and edible.  The potatoes were burnt and dried out.  The bacon in the sandwich (50% burnt on the inside including the bread),  They hide the burned pieces and gave me the ok pieces which were not crisp.  Now If I was a waitress would I bring burned dried out potatoes to a table NO.  That's waitressing 101, I would give it back to the cook,  WHY it effects my tip. Well the sandwich was a bust, the potatoes were a bust, my bacon was barely ok, pancake good.  OK they comped the lunch but that's is not the issue.  This has been a trend at several of this chains places  for a while.  There are lots of new places opening up and if the Good Egg remains mediocre they will be doomed.The name says it all.  Located a few doors down from its sister store Electric Ladyland.  Floozy carries overpriced reconstructed old T-shirts, bedazzled sweatshirts and overly embellished jeans.  Unless you are a teenager on her way to a Clay Aiken Concert I would pass on Floozy.That's not Chinese Food!  This is so watered down to match the vanilla patrons in Scottsdale.  I find it offensive to be frank.Just left the Arena Sorts Grill. I give it one star as the service was excellent. Very attentive ladies behind the bar. However, that it where it stops. The food was absolutely awful. The place smelled of bleach from wipng down the bar area and tables,there has to be something different that can be used. The bathrooms are far from what you expect in a North Scottsdale place of business. Like I said, the bartenders did a great job but that is where it stopped. Never again would we go to this place.This facility is over rated and not reliable. I asked on a few occasions for requests and the service would brush me off. Granted I'm not in the industry where I wear a white collard shirt everyday, but I deserve to be listen to and taken seriously. It is like a large rock rolling down a hill and no one cares to warn the village. It's damned due to it's size!I was told there was a gluten free menu but that was not the case. Horrible options if you are gluten free.I was really excited to try Ray's Pizza, as I recently moved here from NYC and was missing the pizza terribly.

Unfortunately, this pizza reminded me more of Pizza Hut than even the worst pizza place in Brooklyn. NY pizza requires a sweeter crust, doughy but still crispy on the bottom, and sause with actual flavor. This crust was like cardboard. You couldn't fold the pizza because the crust was so dry that it broke if you bent it at all. The sauce was bland and was missing all of the flavors you would expect from a good slice. I don't even want to talk about the cheese but I will. It was probably kraft cheese. It tasted like nothing and didn't move. 

Also, the service is bad. I get it that New Yorkers have attitude... but it wasnt the attitude that was wrong. It was that they forgot to put our pizza in the oven when we ordered it. We had to remind them that the pizza sitting on the counter should go in the oven so that it would eventially come out of the oven and end up on our table.  Maybe we should have just left it behind the counter after all...Not loyal to their regulars. Night manager was rude over a coupon when the right thing would have been to accept it that one time but acknowledge the use next time.The Monument was one of three courses I played while trying to get away from the Chicago cold for a week in late March 2014.  For the money I paid, the best way to sum it up is that it still beat a good day in the office.

The course staff was friendly and courteous, and we played in about 4 hours, which is about 30 minutes faster than time par, but that may have had more to do with a 2:10 pm tee time on a Monday afternoon, so the course was pretty empty.  You do get a feeling that you're golfing in the middle of a desert, but I don't feel that the course was anything special as far as being picturesque.  The only time I felt like taking a picture was on the third hole, which had the Monument rock in the middle of the fairway.  I did like the sand in the bunkers.  It was actually sand, as opposed to rock (admittedly I wish I didn't have to discover that; fortunately I only experienced two of them).

The greens were horrible.  I have no doubt I could find a smoother putting surface on a Chicago city street during pothole season.  I've never seen so many bumps and jostles between the ball and the hole.  My playing partner was affected more because he was generally left with longer putts than me, but on at least 6 holes I watched him miss a putt because the ball bounced within 6 feet of the cup and subsequently fell off line.  On three others where he had long putts, I know his ball stopped shorter than he was planning on because of those bumps.  The wind affected my shots enough that I often had to chip and putt, but the bounciness of the greens cost me strokes with the putter as well.  I'm glad I had to chip and putt, because given the condition of the greens, that probably saved me from multiple 3-putt holes.

I feel that the only reason the price is justified is so they can run the animation for the course flyovers on their website.  This is NOT a course I will play again when I come back to Arizona.  The course I played earlier in my trip, for half the price, had smoother greens than this.Awful. Like, really awful.  Prices are extremely overpriced for the products they have-- as expensive as Whole Foods, but not even organic!  The staff is very mean and definitely not afraid to yell at their customers.  The only thing that is good about the store is the organization of the products.  Everything else stinks! I will never go back to this store.I went there today to drop off a slip cover for an expensive Italian chair I bought from Copenhagen, and the owner would not wash it due to there being dog hair present on the item.  I own a very short hair dog that does not shed very much but stated that any presence of dog hair he would not accept!  Ummmmm, call me crazy but I brought it to you to clean and remove?  Would not recommend went to another cleaner around the corner and they didn't' say anything.  Geez get over yourself buddy!I had to give a star because it's mandatory, but this place should not get one at all. 
My friend and I ate here one night, we were practically alone in this dead restaurant. After the way were treated and the food I can see why it was dead. 
The waitress took about 5 minutes to ask us what we wanted to drink, then took about another 10 to take our dinner order. She told us that rice was not included with our meal and that we had to get it on the side at and extra cost, but the whole meal had rice so I don't know what she was trying to do. After she dropped off our food she came back and was trying to make me put my food on to another plate and got mad when I said no. Then about 20 minutes later she came back and asked if I wanted a box for the rest of my food and I told her no she got mad and didnt come back. We had to go up to the cashier and explain our order to him, right after we did that she finally came over and tried to get in the middle of everything. 

This was the first time I ever had this type of food and at this place, I don't think I will ever try either again.It's been 2 years and that plug is still holding fine through three oil changes. Not a drop of oil spilled.You really have to watch these guys like a hawk. I have now lost two belts to two different dresses with Del Rey. The first I didn't discover until several weeks after I took the dress out of the plastic. Usually when I drop the clothes off, I note the items with detachable belts and they attach them to a separate hanger, but this one was definitely missing. Unfortunately I didn't find it out until long after I had picked up the clothing, so the hassle of fighting with them to find it (and probably not finding it) wasn't worth it. Then about 3 weeks ago, my husband did check everything when picking up and noted another belt was missing. They kept the receipt and promised to look for it and call us, but we haven't gotten any call to date. I'm writing that belt off as well. Finally, I unwrapped yet another dress about two weeks ago and discovered a small red plastic medallion that was stuck on the sleeve. Somehow it must have gotten on the dress when they were cleaning it, so it was glued to the sleeve. When I tried to peel it off, it left red gunk on the material. I'm so irritated that I don't even want to deal with it. Just be very very careful when you pick up your clothes and check everything!I have no idea what the appeal of this place is.  Sure, the view is fantastic but thats really it.  The food was just ok...there was nothing spectacular or mouth watering about anything we ordered.  I was slightly dissapointed that we "wasted" a whole dinner in Phoenix here....I feel that there were many other great restaurants we could have gone to.Worst Walmart on the planet went to get a cell phone and the clerk was the rudest person i have ever had the the pleasure of doing business with.  I will never spend another damn cent in that store again,You probably weren't going to go to John Henry's anyway, but just in case you try to go to Pizzam! and it has an past due rent notice on the door DO NOT decide to go to the next restaurant you see, which will be John Henry's if you drive the most convenient direction out of the parking lot. As we approached John Henry's we tried to guess what kind of food they would serve based on the outside appearance. My money was on Mexican food, but I was wrong. What kind of food do they serve? I am not even sure. There was a REALLY weird guy playing a keyboard (not a piano) for some old people in a lounge area and the oldest waiter in the world served us. Like Craig Z. points out is really absurdly priced and seriously iceberg lettuce? Where am I, Red Lobster? The food was ok maybe? I don't even remember it. I have no idea who goes to this restaurant. None. While we were there it was storming really hard and just outside the front door a transformer BLEW UP. This was definitely the coolest thing about John Henry's. Since that is likely not to happen to you if you go, I would advise you to skip it. Not that you were going to go anyway, cause seriously, who goes here?We were seated.
We perused the menu.
We chatted.
We colored.
We waited.
We were not ever approached by a server, not in 10-15 minutes of sitting there.The only decent thing on the menu is the salmon but even that is average at best. Avoid if you can. The place looks dingy, the staff looks surly, and the edamame is limp... I don't see the point of this place.WARNING! PLEASE READ!

I was so astonished by how bad the service was here, not to mention the RISK that I made a yelp account just to warn others. Coming from a native New Mexican, I will echo what so many people here giving the one star reviews have said (and if you read on you'll see why), the service... 

I came here for mine and my girlfriend's one year anniversary. It was suppose to be a special day. We are both originally from New Mexico so the idea of being able to order the food we grew up on sounded great. We were very excited to go here, but that was very short lived... As I walked up there were two girls and one very young boy at the front counter. I saw they had a very nice patio and asked if we could sit out there. They said that it might be a problem, that a party would be coming and when they got there we would be asked to "leave." I found her choice of words very odd and the other girl tried to explain we would have to relocate. I looked at my girlfriend, already with a bad feeling about the place and asked if she wanted to stay, which she did. 

Now this is when things get important, remember this: I said "I guess we'll eat inside." and the girl replied "Okay, I'll seat you in the bar then." I looked at her crooked and said "Um, no...? Is there a table in the dining room? We don't drink or smoke..." I looked around and the dining room had plenty of tables, not even half full. The girl sighed and grabbed some menus with haste, then took us to the very back, in a gloomy little corner and tossed them down on the table. I was amazed and almost walked out but my girlfriend was still excited some how.

I will say, our waiter was very friendly but he was a terrible waiter. It took him well over 10 minutes after my drink ran and me having to actually get up (flagging him down didn't work) and ask him for a refill. About 5 minutes after that, I finally got one, the thing is... There was something INCREDIBLY strange tasting about my drink. It was non alcoholic, a simple glass of water that tasted like swamp water. I gagged and spit it out. The smell of it was FOUL. 

To add on, the food was VERY mediocre for being in the $10-$15 a plate range. It was very bland and the spices weren't done quite right in my opinion. Again, coming from some one who grew up in New Mexico. 

The entire time, the manager kept giving us these odd looks, staring us down and making us feel uncomfortable. I thought it was all over, but it wasn't...

I had a family member pass through Phoenix and decide to eat here, they told me their story a bit too late however, I should have checked with them first knowing they've been through here. He told me that when he went here on a trip, they insisted on sitting him at the bar because he was alone and were very rude about it. They would not sit him at a table, even though he didn't want alcohol, only food.

The place is very poorly managed and that makes me very sad. I wish my great home state was better represented here in the Valley of the Sun. 

PLEASE BE WARNED, before eating here. You will be treated terribly and who knows what they might do to your food (or drink) if they don't like you.My technician talked the ENTIRE time about her baby daddy and all her issues. Not very happy with the service. Will never go back!I like Denny's      But this place is low quality for its high traffic  the food is not all that good   I have seen a few people who are not satisfied with this service this will be one Dennie's I won't come back toVery disappointed today. Service was slow. Waitress lied and told us it was b/c a party of 19 came in and the mgr later told us that was not the case. On top of it she also forgot to bring our bread to the table after we asked twice. She said it was baking. When we finally got it, it was cold. Another lie. My husband runs restaurants for a living and this was a sad experience. Food was good. Service suckedNot impressed. I had not been here in a while but remembered as much better than it was tonight.  As I sit here my stomach hurts. We ordered a turkey burger, it was dry and had an odd taste combined with the taste of char (which was dominating). My husband got a mushroom burger, the mushrooms were so weird (chopped into nothing, clearly from a can and a sick yellow color). My daughters kids burger was all char no flavor.  Very disappointing.  We left most of our food, when the waitress came over she could see by the looks on our face that it was not going over well, she never offered anything.  Usually when most of the food except one or 2 bites are still on the plate that might trigger some alarm bells.Why do I keep falling into this hellhole?!
4 times, yes, 4, the most I chances I have given a place...either they:
a) Are out of whatever you want.
b) Have bad attitudes.
c) Give you cold food.
d) Give you melted down frozen strawberry lemonade that looks like puke, I should have taken a picture so that you would know I am not making it up.
I am going to yell now, ready? STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!It saddens me terribly right now to give such a low rating to this hotel, when the hotel was actually awesome. The rating is so low due to the customer service my friends and I received from the pit boss during Sunday morning (6/2/13) blackjack session. My softball team and I all stayed at Sunset Station for a softball tourney that we had about 10 miles away. The price was right and we had a teammate who was a high roller at this casino. The food and service the restaurant was great, and the customer service in the gift shop was excellent as well. The problem arrived when 3 friends and I sat down early Sunday morning, money and drink in our hands to play $5 blackjack. The dealers Nana and Leissle were happy to have a change of pace and to play with 4 girls excited and eager not only to tip but to celebrate our winnings together. The cocktail waitresses also enjoyed our company. We sat at this table
For at least 3 hours while the pit boss Ralph continued to tell us we were too loud?!?!!?! As the 4th hour approached us, my friend and I hit a 3rd blackjack in a row betting a $25 hand and we all screamed in excitement. The PitBoss Ralph- then decided to kick myself and my friend out for being too loud! When I asked for a manager, they brought over a large security guard named Mark to escort us out. As we tried to reason with them, I kindly and cooperatively asked to speak with a manager. They denied me the rights to speak with a manager then Mark put his hands on me and told me he would call the cops. I then asked to speak to his manager. After two more security guards came over and our friends were in tears and we had all been denied the right to speak to a manager they denied us yet again and asked us  to fill out a comment card! Even one of the cocktail waitresses walked over to explain to the security guard that we were doing nothing wrong. The security guards then warned us they had called the police and they were on their way. We exited the casino immediately after that. I will never stay here again, nor will my team or anyone I know. I will be calling to speak with a manager and because I left my name and number I am expecting ad waiting for someone to call me!!! Worst customer service and Las Vegas and overall casino experience I have ever had. Be aware and do not stay there. The rooms are cheap, but at what cost!!! You have no rights, and no respect!!!!!Thought the food here was okay. Service was extremely slow and we figured that's because the person behind the counter slooooooowly makes one burrito at a time. 

It was $20 for 2 pretty big burritos, a bottle of water and two sides of chips for me and my hubs. Reasonable amount for a simple dinner out. 

Now,... I've never, EVER gotten food poisoning from eating out before, but I most definitely got it from Chipotle friday night. My night was MISERABLE, so thanks for that! 

Note: I'm never returning. Don't even think about offering me a friggin' coupon,... but getting my money back would be fabulous.Stepping through the door is like going back in time and not in a good way! Waited nearly 10 min to be acknowledged by a server then when prompted she only knew one of the multiple specials on at the time. Also as a brewery I'd highly suggest training your staff on styles of beer. Dark is not an adequate description and all beers are not lagers. I'm sure the food menu hasn't changed since the doors first opened so we didn't have the guts to order what surely would be frozen food microwaved to half life.Okay so let me preface this by saying that take my review for what its worth and believe me when I say that I am not just posting a negative review because I didn't end up getting what I wanted. 
So I arrived at this dealership with my Uncle whom was going to be helping me with my down payment as well as the negotiating process for the vehicle I was attempting to lease. Please keep in mind that I had already submitted my application online and been in contact with Dan.
When we arrive at the dealership we are met by Chris Findlay as Dan was not available. We test drive the car and return to the office to discuss the numbers with Chris. We tell Chris what we can afford to put down and he then tells us that he will return. Then Dan comes in the room and says " so if we can't get this to work with $1300 down and payments of $250 you are goign to walk out of here?" My uncle replies and says "that is correct." Dan then says" hold on a minute and I will come back witha  simple yes or no answer." Dan returns and says " you are lucky that our general manager Mike is here because he has the final say and he did say we can approve your request." Chris returns to the room and begins some paperwork and I even write a check to hold the vehicle until the morning since it literally was still wrapped in plastic and it needed to be detailed.  Chris and Dan ask us what time we can come back the next morning to sign all the paperwork. They both shake our hands and say " this deal is locked in."

We leave the dealership and return the next morning only to be shocked as now we are being told that the bank will not approve the discussed deal the previous night. The general manager Mike comes in to help diffuse the situation as my Uncle was furious. Mike then starts rambling that when he looked at the credit report that morning he didn't see some aspects that might have been an issue. ...I'll cut the story here.

These guys didn't even look at my credit report until the day I was supposed to take ownership. They made all these promises and wasted our time. The biggest issue that would have illeviated all of this stress is if they would have used the word "contingent" If they would have said that the deal was locked in contingent on bank approval then all would have been fine. I don't have perfect credit and even communicated this with them multiple times and they always reassured me that everything would be fine.

If you want to check out cars here that is fine. If you buy here that is fine but please just keep my story in the back of your mind and if they treat you as poorly as we were treated PLEASE also share your experience here. These guys are the bottom of the barrel and I hope this review is able to stop even a handful of people from patronizing this dealership.

I will say that I did end up purchasing a vehicle from Desert VW and they were AWESOME!!! go to DESERT VW and NOT FINDLAY!worse than the garbage they call their enchilada sauce.
My husband and I went there this evening, the man who took our order (finally) spoke one word the whole time we were ordering which was "combo?" To my request for the #3. We got home to discover his beef nachos filled with bell pepper and onions. No big deal, maybe we should've asked. We go back, I explain he doesn't eat this and ask to exchange it. The man has to call the manager (while I'm at the car explaining to my husband that ALL their meat choices apparently come with the peppers and onions) I come back and he gives me his phone so the manager can explain that her employee told us there would be peppers and onions in the meat. I asked if she would just refund my money and she very condescendingly said "well just this once". No apology, no customer service  .
I would rather drive the extra 10 minutes to the next closest one than go back.Agree, worst McDonalds ever. Not only did they mess up our order, they messed up the order before ours.What a freaking joke! I have been here twice and expected at least a decent manicure/pedicure.  The wait was ridiculous and non-accommodating. I wanted Julie and was willing to wait for her. However was told Julie doesn't do appointments. Um, excuse me? Total waste of time, money and effort. Will never recommend nor come back. Go get your nails done at the fabulous Diamond Nails and Spa!Expensive, understaffed, messy..... horrible customer service. Terrible return policy...The quality of the hamburgers was poor-dried out to say the least.  The place was a dirty mess-the kitchen looked disgusting (floor and counters looked dirty) and so did the restaurunt!   I will NEVER go back.This place gave my friend's honeymoon suite away to the Kardashians on their wedding night.

Yes, that's right. We all came to this hotel for our friend's wedding. Upon check in we found out that the owner of the hotel had decided to give the whole top floor to the Kardashians who had shown up, thus kicking my friends who were getting married at the Artisan out of the honeymoon suite. The Artisan put them in a regular room. They also flat out gave away several rooms that belonged to guests in the wedding party to the Kardashians so our friends had to go out to the strip on a Friday night and pay rack rate to stay somewhere else. The owner of this hotel screwed my friends and the entire hotel staff. Because the Kardashians wanted to have dinner in the one and only restaurant the hotel has, our friend's wedding reception got moved onto an outdoor patio. Did I mention it was 107 degrees? Also, the other stuff people complained about in their reviews of this hotel were true for us too. It's off the strip and cabs don't want to come here so we had to wait 45 minutes or so every time we called a cab. The key card to my room didn't work and neither did the next one we got or the next one. It got to the point where everytime we came back to the hotel we'd have to get someone from the front desk to let us in. One time we came back at 2 a.m. and had a huge man block the elevator saying he was holding it for the Kardashians. This is a 5 floor hotel with only one elevator. I don't care if Bill Clinton is there. Get out of my way and off the elevator. The owner of this hotel is greedy,unet hical and treats his staff like crap. They worked 16 hours on Sat, taking care of us, other weddings and the Kardashians. Imagine you had shown up for your wedding and found out this had been done to you. I urge you to not stay at this hotel. There is no casino there, only 1 restaurant which could be commandeered at any moment by some random celebrity and then you can't even get room service, only 1 small bar and it's off the strip and cabs won't go there so.... you end up trapped at a crappy hotel that used to be a Super 8. Yes, it was a Super 8. I hope the owner, and the Kardashians, both go bankrupt. And, if you have kids, don't go there. Pot was at the pool and cocaine was in the bathrooms. Saw it with my own eyes. I was shocked and horrified by how badly my friends, who were spending a lot of money to have their wedding there, were treated by the Artisan Hotel. Go to Hotwire and get a good deal on a nice hotel on the strip. Send this hotel owner a message and never stay here!Took a while to update this,  but made a better business bureau complaint and they couldn't be bothered to even answer the BBB.  Yep,  they suck...I went into this place for the first time today. I almost gagged when I found out what the prices were. The selection is incredible. But the prices give you a bend over and grab your ankles feeling. But it's a free market, he can charge what he wants to. I'm not going to support this kind of exorbitant pricing.I used to go to Sam Woo when it first opened and always like the bbq pork fried rice and the sliced bbq pork which were always good.  I had to give the place a break after trying other dishes that weren't so great, and also because they have been closed several times by the health department. I've gone there when they had a B rating, and turned around and walked out.  Keep your eye on them, I think you can find the latest restaurant ratings in the RJ.This Credit Union is a joke.  As the other reviews are dead on.  They charge you for everything, and I  mean everything.  And if you have over $25,000.00 in the bank, they start to charge you a maintenance fee....So, basically, the more you deposit, the more they take.  And forget about calling and getting answers, or even going in there, if you don't have a full day to waste. Please do yourself a favor, go elsewhere.These people are thieves, stay away if you want to keep your valuables. I brought two expensive diamond rings in for Romy to redesign and they never called to let me know the rings were ready , I return numerous times and was told they were in the vault and they would call me when they were located, never did. They kept my property, two rings valued at over $5000. Stay away, THEIVES. I will post this everywhere so no one else gets ripped off by these THEIVESThis review is for the Travel Agency department. 
I went to ask for information about a possible trip I was planning.
My agent was all business and NO friendliness. NONE. She hardly even made eye contact after she kept me waiting 10 minutes after our appointment. I told her what I was looking for, she called someone, (I have no idea who), gave me the prices the other person quoted her. Then said if I had any other questions, that I would have to contact a fellow AAA agent because she was going to Australia and would be unavailable. When I asked for a copy of her notes, she seemed bothered. I guess I was expected to memorize the quotes she had given me. Needless to say--- I WON'T be booking with AAA travel any time in the future.Unfortunately this place did not hit the "luv it" meter for us. There was a limit on flavors available, only 5, although the sign listed over 15 flavors. The custard was bland tasting. Especially disappointing was the mint chip. The mint flavor was very weak and there wasn't even any real chocolate chips inside. It was chocolate sprinkle pieces... Disappointing.I am over COX at this point.  I signed up in May for new service since I was moving into a new apartment and would need service.  Over the phone I was promised $40 or $5 per month for 6 months.  Something happened and I had to change my apartment #.  They told me everything would be the same.  When i got in the my apartment my internet was slow and when I called them I found out that my service was changed to the lower service.  

I called them about it and spoke with several people.  They promised me they would fix it.  Got my first bill and there was no discount.  I called again, and was promised that I would get $30.00 off my bill for 12 months for all my time.  

Several months have gone by and I realized that since my payment was auto pay it was not changed.  It is 7:45pm on a Saturday night and there is no one there to help me.  What horrible customer service.  I am really sick and tired of big companies like Cox taking advantage of people like me.Can I get some help please?.... Forgot. I'm at Walmart.
  I went here because its close by and needed some aloe vera gel for a sunburn.  My son and I went searching and searching AND searching. Couldn't find it. Couldn't find someone who works there (like that would help?) I even asked another customer if they had any idea. They tried to help but they couldn't find it either. 
  I finally found someone who looked swamped putting items on the shelf. Her reply? " its that way on the bottom" Ohhhh. Should've known it was somewhere "over there".  Still no luck. Walking half the store and finally found some one. I asked her. Her response? "I don't work here" (apparently, nobody does any WORK around here).
  Lucky for me, SHE was polite and walked me right to it.  My 7yr old asked me why she knows where it is and she doesn't even work here.  What do you say to that?
  Not enough staff and the ones that "work" there either are too busy to help or have no clue what customer service is.
  Get some illegal immigrants in there. Maybe I won't understand them but at least there will be an excuse for the poor service.
  Don't shop here with a gun.  You'll kill yourself or go postal.They were supposed to design and  build our booth, a big one. TWO weeks before the event they said they could not work on it and did not have anything ready. I would not recommend working with them.Horrible!!! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! 

I booked two limos one week in advance, and they charged my card 2 1/2 x the price of EACH limo (which I said we'd pay in cash) the next day - before their services were even used. ($500 charge on my card, which was only supposed to be used to hold the cars, not to pay for them - this was explicitly stated.) 

When I called to find out why, they sent my call to voicemail. No apologies, and certainly no customer service. These people are criminals - watch out!!!Person in front of us complained about their wrong order, then 10 min later i was helped. Employee was flustered and rude. He answered the phone in the middle of tsking sn order and instead of puting them on hold talked to them for literally 10 min, which is a long time. Then he stopped to tell the lady cook how to do orders, seriously?! Then he took my order, everyone else waiting for their food had problems with their order and how long it took. I waited 45 MINUTES FOR MY FOOD AT A COUNTER ORDERED JOINT!!! They forgot my baklava, and i ordered seasoned fries, i got none, then asked about it and mentioned how long it took and he honestly said these words exactly, "I can just give you your money back and you can go to a fast food place." Are you kidding me! I had to be somewhere for work and if I am a very kind, patient person, because I work in the F&B industry but never in my life have I ever had this worse of service. I wish I could give them 0 stars. I was floored!Upon arriving the restaurant was not busy for an early sunday morning. We were the only ones waiting to be seated. We were a party of 6 with 4 being children. I asked to have one highchair. I was seated at a booth then had to remind the waitress after several minutes if I could please have my highchair. The staff didn't seem too friendly but perhaps they are more used to serving the mostly an older crowd and were put off by all my kids. 

As far as the food we ordered the biscuits and gravy with eggs and potatoes. It was not good and worse my breakfast potatoes were green. The waffle and french toast breakfast plates were just ok not worth the price. The only on who enjoyed his food was my son who ordered pancakes with chocolate chips. They are not cooked in like other places they just threw a ton of chips on top so he had a big melted mess of chocolate everywhere. 

I'm pretty sad I did not get the experience everyone else seems to rave about. Normally I give places with really good reviews a second chance in case I came on a bad day. This place I will not being coming back to. If a cook bothers to serve me a potato thats obviously not ripe and green makes me feel like they don't care about the food they serve.hate this fucking casino.the security guards are a bunch of fuckwads that bitch about any little thing.I don't think anyone likes to be treated like an adolescent for absolutely nothing. I'll go to a movie here but never anything else.I've said before I rarely give out 1 star but this hotel surely deserved it. 

I booked a night here for obvious reasons (the ridiculously low price)

Upon arriving I was greeted by an unfriendly valet attendant. 

Checking in was a long and unnecessary process. It seemed they were using a software program that was not very user friendly. 

I was under the idea that all the girls would be dressed in uniform.... That wasn't the case at all.

They gave me a room with two beds because a king room wasn't available.

Upon entering the room I was disgusted by the smell and overall cleanliness of the room. It looked dated and unkempt.

The TV looked like it belonged in a thrift store, the picture was fuzzy and it had a horrendous selection of channels. 

The bathroom was disgusting. The tile looked very old and the shower was uncomfortable. 

The linens and towels felt hard and cheap.

I can forgive a lot of things, but being one of the biggest chains in the restaurant business and taking pride in the esthetics of their restaurants I expected a lot more from the "remodel" from it's previous property the San Remo.

Even though I read this article http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/dec/28/eight-changes-coming-hooters-casino-hotel/#axzz2YA4Oq4Fo 

I am still very apprehensive to return to this hotel. I have personally stayed at motel's that take more pride in their property. I hope the former Hard Rock Manager can truly make a difference because this place has so much potential. 

I will leave this review on a good note. I went to have dinner at the lounge and did have excellent service, the food was acceptable and I thoroughly enjoyed the live music.I ordered PHO #31 with extra meat. Well I got 1 ounze of chicken the same that comes with a standard order. This happened on 2 seperate occassions. Will not be back!!The food overly greasy and unappealing and it all just felt extremely cheap and low-end.
Food is bad a year than a year，I never come back！This Midas is a major rip-off. They should have the Midas pull. I tow my car in for repair because it won't start. I was told all kinds of problem and will cost $1600. But after I took the car to another shop I was told that was simple fix and can be done for $850. Readers, you do the math. Stay away from this shop if you value your hard earned money.I've been coming here for about five years and today was my last day. I sat down and pulled out my e-cigarette as I have been doing for the past three years. I ordered a beer and a menu. I decided on my usual and placed my order. When the server came back, she said I was not allowed to use my e-cigarette in there. As per the owner, "E-cigarettes are no longer allowed but cigarettes and cigars are." 

When I first started coming here, I was a smoker! The food is great and they have a nice draught selection. I have nothing against smoke or smokers, obviously because this place has tons of smokers who are usuals. I really liked the place too! The low ceilings combined with the chain smokers makes for a vintage Vegas experience that you really can't find much these days.

Don't try to apply logic here. It really makes no sense. I honestly think someone could get away with smoking a joint in here because there is that much smoke. Make sure you don't bring your electronic cigarette though, you could fill those with cannabis! The ironic part is that there's a sign out front that says 'smoker friendly.'

If the owner banned cigarettes AND e-cigarettes, that would somewhat make sense, but I STILL wouldn't go back. At least he was being consistent.

Do not go here to watch Buckeyes games either, they will yell at you for being loud when you are just cheering. I can't speak for Browns games on Sunday though. The local Buckeye bar is now PT's Gold on Rainbow anyway and has been for several years now.

Pros: 
Very smokey, like Jazz pool-hall it has that smokey-blue tinge in the right light.
The usuals are all great!
The pizza is fantastic!

Cons:
No electronic cigarettes.Wow I was there a few weeks ago and I didn't feel too well after.   This explains why.

http://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/dirty-dining/Dirty-Dining-Cathay-House-in-Chinatown-261931831.html?lc=SmartWtf. Only giving a 1 star rating because they changed the chicken enchilada soup. Who's the jackass who decided to change the soup. Steward fire him or her please. This bar was sooooo busy u had to fight to get to the bar what happened??? How much money ru you losing now? It's scary to think about it? Maybe It's about time to make a change. As business owner what the fuck are you thinking?just found out they use fructose corn syrup in the ice cream, very disappointed in them. Why do they use that?Possibly the worst service I've ever had in Madison.  A hostess once tried to take away the table we'd just been seated at because some friend of hers wandered by and wanted to be seated immediately.  I've often had to wait quite awhile for waitstaff.

The food is nothing special--not BAD, but definitely overpriced.  The half-price margaritas, the only reason I ever go there, are pretty good, but they recently instituted a requirement that you purchase like $10 worth of their overpriced food in order to get a table rather than being confined to the bar.  Not worth it.On Nov. 2, 2013, we ordered breakfast of various versions of scrambled eggs.  Oddly -- or cheaply -- Bluephies uses less-than-full-size plates, so our food covered the entire plate.  If you're looking for quantity, you'll be happy.  If you want just the average size portions, and like to mix up your scrambled eggs with some of your hash browns, these less-than-full-size-plates that it very hard to do.  Secondly, the service was not very good: I was not offered water (and I do appreciate restaurants that save water by not automatically giving it out, since not all patrons want water) and we had quite a time of it trying to flag our waitress to get some (finally got water from the bus boy).   I asked for more napkins and was given cocktail napkins rather than larger, more suited-to-the-task dining napkins.  Again, we had quite a time of it to get the attention of our waitress to ask her to exchange those puny cocktail napkins for properly-sized dining napkins.Do they charge everyone $76 for a simple mani/pedi? I told my nail technician I was from Chicago and I think she glanced at my purse and just threw out that price to see if she could get away with it. Stunned, I paid $76 and tipped $10 because, being non-confrontational to strangers, I didn't know what else to do. I sat there for the next 15 minutes stewing while she finished painting my nails and searching for a website on my phone looking for listed prices (nothing was posted on the wall and of course they don't have a website). I feel extremely ripped off and taken advantage of and don't know where else to report this. On top of that It took longer than 2 hours and I reeked like dollar store lotion. Couldn't have been a worse experience. $76 for something that lasts a week. Just awful Nails.I just went to the West Clinic for a dermatologist appointment.  It was my first time there, and I think I would probably go back but ONLY if I went to another doctor.  The check-in process was seamless and quick, despite there being a line, so if I were rating on things other than the doctor, it would probably get 5 stars.  But a clinic visit is mostly about the service you receive with the doctor.  I saw Dr. Ann Rosin for a basic check-up.  But I barely saw her.  I believe she was in the room with me for about five minutes.  She made me feel as if I was just another thing on her long list of things-to-do and the quicker she finished my appointment, the more things she could get done.  She didn't even ask if I had any questions before she was on her way out the door.  I literally sat on the table in shock after she left because I couldn't believe things just happened the way they did.  I have been to some bad, rushed doctors, but I have never felt so "un-cared" for.This is one of the worst restaurants I've ever tried to order from.  They take 2 hours to get you delivery, they always screw up the my order and they have no clue how to give good service.  Every time I've worked with them, they've screwed something up and they've never tried to make it right.  If Madison had any other food options, I would never order from them again.I have been going here for a couple years. No more. They have had three breakins in the parking lot. It is clearly an unsafe neighborhood. The problem is no doubt worse during the nighttime. Enough is enough. Management seems unresponsive to providing security or surveillance.Ever taken a flight on a crusty dog turd? Neither have I, but I imagine it's not much unlike flying US Airways--the all time worst airline in every conceivable way.

How does an airline (that is already at the bottom of the barrel) get away with cutting back so ridiculously far on service while simultaneously  jacking up prices so ridiculously high on everything from water to luggage to aisle seats?!

Wow, great business plan, douchebags--take something that already sucks, make it worse and charge people more for it!  

Honestly, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if the greedy crack smokers that run this airline started charging for toilet paper. By the square.Like an evil health insurance company, U.S. Airways is always looking for new ways to rob its customers with fees. I'll never forget how U.S. Airways refused to give me a cup of potable water on a flight when I had bronchitis because I didn't have cash to buy a bottle. This airline is America's worst!This is the WORST place in the world to go!!  Please STOP giving them business, I don't care if they are Greek and their Dad earned every single dollar that he has worked for.  They probably are living comfortable now!  I am not Greek and also have earned every single dollar that I have worked for.  I work for a large agency in downtown Phoenix that gives this restaurant lots of business daily.  Today, the owner's daughter (our waitress) who I recognize because we eat there so much, was so rude to us!  Granted we arrived at 12pm and the place was packed but they seated us right away.  When the daughter came over to take our drink order, we placed our drink orders and she started walking away.  I tried to tell her that we were ready to place our order knowing that the place is very busy.  She rolled her eyes and grudgingly came back.  I told her that is fine that we could wait to place our order and she left without taking our order.  We got our drinks and my friend asked twice for a refill of her raspberry iced tea.  The first time the daughter rolled her eyes and kept walking like she didn't hear her.  The second time, she just shook her head, rolled her eyes and kept walking.  Finally, at 12:45pm, I looked in the daughter's eyes and told her, "you hate us, don't you?"  I could tell she hated us and probably wished we were dead.  She said no but that they are very busy and everybody came at the same time.  I told her that we have been waiting 45 minutes for 2 salads and that we needed our food to go now because we don't have time to eat now.  Then her mom (owner's wife) came over and said, "oh, you don't have time to eat because you only have a 30 minute lunch?"  I said no that we have a 1 hour lunch but we have been waiting 45 minutes for our lunch and we don't have time to eat here now.  The daughter brought the food to go for us (I was afraid they spit in it by then.)  I paid the ridiculous overpriced cost of $25 for the 2 salads and 1 iced tea (I had water) and didn't tip her of course.  I told her I would never be back and wouldn't tip her either.  It was the worst experience of my life in a restaurant that I have ever had!  I will never give them business again and I think all of downtown Phoenix should boycott them and go eat at Sticklers or the many new restaurants at CityScape.  Heck, I even get treated better at Subway down the street for a lot less money!!!This is the first restaurant that I've been asked to leave because there were customers waiting outside.  We waited about 10 minutes to get in; sat down and received water and coffee, 5 minutes later put in our order and received our food within ~7 minutes.  We ate and chatted.  As soon as we got the bill the young gal said we needed to hurry and leave because there were customers waiting for seats.  To boot the food wasn't that good either.The fact that Networks had four stars a few days ago and now only averages three demonstrates the potential impact of not treating your customers well, especially when six out of eight of them just happen to be Yelpers who are not afraid to write about their bad experience. 

I was part of the group of 8 that stopped by Networks during last Saturday's pub crawl (which was featuring drink specials and food samples from downtown businesses). This event was clearly planned in order to generate more business for these local spots, which makes the manager's refusal to give us $1 beer and wine or any sort of meaningful concession (when the downtown pub crawl materials said "$1 beer, $1 signature wines" with no "off" anywhere in sight) that much worse. 

You are certainly free to check this place out for yourself and maybe these four one-star reviews won't do anything to change Networks' core crowd of patrons, but I can guarantee you that Networks lost the approval (and referral) of five very grumpy Yelpers!

P.S. Congealed, cold pizza cut into miniature slices doesn't count as a "food sample."Since the last time I was there: NO AC, the one avail toilet was broken and backed up creating a foul odor across the venue. Not to mention the hundreds of sweaty 13 year olds hanging out making a mockery of themselves instead of allowing others to enjoy the only pleasurable experience from this place... the music.I went tho this dentist with an emergency tooth. I was in excruciating pain. The dentist came in like the other reviewer stated with the mask already on which was weird. The place is not real clean and the equipment was outdated for a dentist. I.E no digital imaging equipment. They said they could save the tooth but I needed to run a cycle of antibiotics before they could do anything to the tooth.

I ran a week of the antibiotics but was not getting better and they wanted me to go see another periodontist  to evaluate the tooth but like most I work and did not have the time this week to go before I could no longer stand the pain.

The pain was not subsiding and I called this dentist back to see if they could help me, they had me come in first thing the next morning where I got chastised for not seeing the periodontist. The dentist says to me "so what do you want me to do?" I said I want you to do something to fix the tooth so I would no longer be in pain, he says I can't give you more pain pills. I exclaim I DON"T WANT MORE PILLS I WANT MY TOOTH FIXED!!!! He proceeds to tell me that since I did not go see the periodontist that he may not be able to save the tooth as was told to me in the beginning and he had this holier than though attitude. He said so you just want me to pull it? 

At that point i was so angry that, rather than try to show compassion and help me by making suggestions like a GOOD dental practitioner would, I just got right up out of his chair and walked out!

As of this writing I am still dealing with the pain and again searching for dentist who will help me but one this is for sure, I will never set foot in this office againDon't waste your time and call this company if you have a budget. They just want to argue. You are not allowed to only partially clean a house up to a certain number of hours.  I personally don't like being lectured when I book a service and then being denied service because I don't have enough money to spend with them.C'mon yelpers! This place is horrible, can't even finish my lunch. This kung pao chicken is garbage. They use the cheapest, most disgusting part of the chicken to make this meal! The meat is dark, fatty, and doesn't even taste like chicken. Plus the portion is tiny. I should have known walking into this dump. If you want REAL asian food that would blow your mind and make you never ever ever come back to this dump, go to T&J Asian Cuisine on 107th ave and Olive. You can thank me later.Ordered the family pack which included 25 wings, fries and garlic bread.  When I checked my order the fries were cold.  I asked the lady can I please have some fresh french fries.  She immediately got an attitude and told me they was not cold.  She did take them back with an attitude and gave me some fresh ones with salt and I said no salt.  I didn't want to address the issue again, so I took them. The fries were salty and the wings tasted as if they were sitting there and hot sauce was applied to them. Not to mention the garlic bread didn't even have any garlic butter whatever just toasted. The wings were very small. Very disappointment, customer service very poor and food was not good. Will never visit this location again!this place sucks bad go any ware but here and get better severs well not return stuff if thay do not feel like it and ther words not mine"Holy moly donut shop" the flies were flying and dead ones on my chair when we sat. Moldy bread was served then replaced.  Like most of the area the place needs to be cleaned then recleaned... new chairs as well!  Been coming here for years... need that clean  loving country grandma feel back. For now it was pretty scary.
Toy should be disinfected as well with EVERYTHING in that TOY bucket gift holder for every kid, my child's toy was sticky from what seemed like syrup.My husband and I live close by and decided to try Alessia's. When we walked in we were greeted by the bartender who said the hostess would be right back. We waited a few minutes and she never came. I was hugging my husband and this waiter decided to come up behind me and say hello as if he were going to seat us. I immediately let go of my husband only to find that he was just saying hi. The hostess still was not there so after a minute the waiter seated us and told us to sit where ever we wanted. So what was the point of waiting at all??? Anyways...

We browsed the menu and noting really seemed that appetizing to me. My husband asked the waiter how big the portions are for the fettuccine alfredo. The waiter looked at my husband like he was an idiot for asking such a question and said, " I don't know, like average?  Does that make sense?" My husband was pissed, but blew it off as to not ruin the evening. We ordered the fettuccine alfredo to split which came with a salad. The salad was good, but the alfredo tasted like EASY MAC! I would have sent it back, but I didn't want to make my husband feel bad because he chose the restaurant and I was hungry. The alfredo wasn't enough food, so we decided to order calamari from our SECOND waiter. Yes, they have multiple waiters as if they are TRYING to be a FIVE star restaurant, which they are not even close. Then our FIRST waiter came back to ask us if we wanted dessert, when we had just ordered something. I just think it is unorganized and confusing to have five different waiters. I felt like no one knew what was going on and that we kept getting interrupted. 

Normally at Italian restaurants the calamari is fried, but not here. They set it in front of us and I was horrified. I did not want a nasty rubbery ring tomato soup. We sent it back and decided to just forget ordering anything else. We received our bill and noticed there was a $4 charge for "splitting" the EASY MAC. This place is such a rip off. We paid $18 for a two small bowls of EASY MAC. We did not see on the menu that there was a charge for splitting meals because if we had we would have not split a meal. I will never in my life come back to this place ever again!Restaurant only....we stopped in tonight and were not impressed.
5 Year old specifically ordered a hamburger, ketchup and cheese only. It came with all the fixins and we had to pick them off. He does not like pickles and did not like the juice on his bun. The bun was huge and it was hard. The cheese that he wanted stuck to the lettuce. The fries tasted like they were cooked in old oil. 
Hubby ordered a pasta dish with Seafood. He ate half and then the waitress was helping the couple at next table - the woman wanted to know about the seafood dish so the waitress asked if he liked it. His reply, "it was okay". When asked if he would order it again, he said, no, it was not that good.
Me, I ordered the Taco Salad. Took one bite and the meat-bean mixture was cold. I sent it back and it looked like it came out new (I had stirred it up), again, the meat-bean mixture was cold - I had two bites. It was tasted like lard since it wasn't warmed to the right temp. Ordered a slice of pie and mentioned to the waitress that the taco salad was cold which, it why I didn't eat it. She was going to comp the $1.00 pie. 
I mentioned at the register that I did not eat the Taco Salad and asked for it to be removed and I would pay for my pie. He offered to remove $5. That left me paying $3.99 for a Taco Salad that I did not eat. I told him that was fine but I would not be back. He said, sorry to hear that.  The couple sitting next to me did not receive the correct steak. The cook made a rib-eye instead of a strip or something to that effect. In short, the cook made an error on their order. Reading other reviews. It sounds like they need a new cook in the kitchen.
I would give the waitresses more stars, they are really hard trying to make up for lack of help in the kitchen. They were fun and joked with my son before the meal arrived. 

I recommend the butcher shop, we have been a customer for years. Their meat is good and I love their twice bake potatoes. Buy a steak and cook it at home. Skip the restaurant.Just came back from that festival. I don t want to be bad. We are from Europe. This is a real joke. Between charlemagne ( 8th century), the elephants, and the renaissance it is almost 600 years between!  You pay 20 dollars for what! Park your car maybe in rocks!.you must pay everything inside. 1 dol to 6 dol at least. Just for rides. Family of 6. It hurts!. + food(awfull) drinks( I am not sure they put any alcohol in the cocktails($6 each). Go once and never go back. Good luck!It has been some time since I had patronage Churches Chicken and now I remember why. I ordered the chicken strips, fries and a drink. I ordered a mixture of original chicken and spicy chicken. Well, to be honest it was all bland, that was the taste I remembered and why I had not been back. Too bad!Wow... I'm surprised that this place exists with the great wine bar next door.

I don't know what they are currently doing with their interior but there is NOTHING on the walls and there are white patch marks everywhere. I assume they are going to repaint/redecorate but in the mean time it's awful looking and echos. Not as warm and friendly as I remember from 6 months ago.  Also their outside specials board states they have live music from Thurs- Sat however the waitress informed us it was Fri-Sat... want to change that sign maybe?

The appetizer board we had compromised of 3 meats and one cheese which were all very tasty however there were only 4 very small pieces of cheese vs. the 8 slices of each of the other meats. We waited approximately 30 minutes for our diners which was on the lingering side since there were very few people inside that night. (2-3 other couples total)

The diner was two stars at best. My lavosh was very soggy with no crisp to it. I had to use a fork since the pieces (long rectangular shaped) would not hold any shape.  The chef overlapped all of the pieces atop each other and put a very odd/gross tasting garnish in the center. If they had not laid the pieces atop each other(who does that anyway?), the pieces wouldn't have come out soggy. And the garnish - just get rid of it - don't know why it's there and why it had such an awful taste. I would make the pieces smaller(more manageable) and display them on a plate long-ways laid out completely. 

The pasta, no better than that of an olive garden with flakes of red pepper on top. Chicken was dry and it could have used flavor. It was better than the lavosh though.

And the wine... now I did like some of their wines, but they always push the Kokopelli ones and I understand that. It's like going to a micro brewery and asking for a Miller lite. HOWEVER, they serve some great wines that are not made by Kokopelli which I enjoy more. If the waitress was more open to the other non-kokopelli wines I would have probably enjoyed more wine and stayed longer. 

All in all for the price we paid, it will be a stroke of drunken luck if we ended up here again.I basically don't like when shops assume I don't know anything about cars because I take my car to a shop to get an oil change rather than doing it myself.  I was a loyal Hontech customer until recently I was told I needed a whole new oil pan for my Honda because they could not work with the aftermarket oil plug that was on the car.  It had a oil plug used by places like JiffyLube. It has an opening in the center of the oil plug for them to attach a vacuum to suck out the oil.  Well the plastic plug in the center had broken off and because of that Hontech could not change the oil and recommended to install a whole new oilpan...I opted out and the next day went to Autozone, bought a new oil plug for $2.50, and changed the oil myself.  Saved myself a few hundred dollars.  I'm no longer taking my vehicles to Hontech and looking for a new mechanic....I went back today and today was the quite possibly the last time I will ever go.  

That last statement almost pains me since my family are long time residents of Chandler (as in wherever you live in Chandler was probably a melon, cotton, alfalfa field or dairy when we got here).

The above being said, I only make the point to say I remember when the place was actually really good.

Today they hit rock bottom with such force that they should close the doors permanently.

First, it's not like the place was packed (it wasn't) but we asked for a booth.  The booth needed to be cleaned.  The hostess/manager asked the busboy to clean the open booth for us.  Long story short, two other booths emptied out before our booth was cleaned.  Strike one.

We sat down and ordered coffee and water.  After two more requests for water, it arrived.  Strike two.

We ordered breakfast.  Twenty five minutes later (again, the place wasn't crowded) I asked if I needed to go back and help cook.  Five minutes later, the wrong order (not even remotely close to what we asked for) showed up at our table.  Strike three...I outta here!!!!

As an aside a table of three ahead of us had their order dorked up too.  It went back to the kitchen at least twice.

Sorry to say, but the folks at Brunchies have given up.

A zero is appropriate here but isn't a choice.So I took both of my dresses (ceremony & reception) from my wedding here to get dry-cleaned...and I was willing to pay and arm and a leg to make sure  my Maggie Sottero and Justina McCaffrey was taken care of, money is not an issue when I knew that I would be trying to re-sell these after they were dry-cleaned.

I asked the nice gentleman at the counter, 'Jason' if they had insurance for these, and he said 'no, but if anything happened to them they would be covered'. For some reason, that stuck in my head. The total bill was $150 per dress, costing me a good $300, and one week to wait to pick them up.

A week later as I go to pick them up, the manager 'Jason' and the clerk 'Jason' (interesting how both of them had the same name) were working and showed my dresses to me in garment bags. I noticed the lacing on the back of my Maggie was gone, and I couldn't see it anywhere. I asked them about it and they were just as baffled. They said that it's probably somewhere in the bag, so when I go home, double check it, and if it's not there, give them a call back.

So I drive home, and turn the bags & dresses inside and out and find no backing to the Maggie dress. I need it obviously since I'm not wearing the dress again, but need to resell it, and there's no way anybody's going to buy this dress without the ability to tie it up! So I call Jason and explain to him that not only were they missing, my Justina was still very dirty and it looked like it was never dry-cleaned.

To make a long story short, I got my Justina dry-cleaned (for free by the manager this time) , but the beading at the top was missing pretty badly. They never found my Maggie straps and at this point, I was so frustrated that I just asked for my money back for the dry-cleaning on both of them. 

They mailed me a refund check  (which they should have just credited to my account in the first place), it came with a apology letter and a $10 delia's coupon. Which just went straight in the trash. I think I was pretty nice during this entire process despite the fact that both of my dresses are unsellable and in worse condition before they went into Delia's.Service is non-existent.  Ordered 5 drinks.  Took forever.  A group came in wtih a large dog while we were sitting waiting for our drinks.  The dog was served a bowl of water and a large carrot that he tore up all over the patio while we were stil waiting for our five drinks.  A table next to us had an issue with a bowl of something.  The waiter was holding the bowl in the air.  One of the people in my group asked the waiter what was wrong with it.  The waiter, still holding the bowl, looks over and yells back, there's a hair in it.  We had ordered a couple of sandwhiches.  With the waiter's info, we went up and canceled our order and left.  Good luck to anyone wanting to be served and wanting clean food.Last time I checked, customer service for family and community orientated businesses was supposed to be key.  Unfortunately, the owners of the Sugar Bowl are not equipped to provide any friendliness-factor.

It's okay that the Sugar Bowl doesn't do group events, but the way to communicate that information to your customers isn't "I'm really going to pass. No. I need to interrupt because the answer is no." There are so many ways to communicate a message, but rudeness is a way to lose business fast.

History or no history, the Sugar Bowl has lost this customer for good.this place sucks. meat tastes like straight asshole!COCKROACHES IN THE FOOD!!!

After my disappointing experience with Malee's at Desert Ridge several years ago I pretty much wrote the chain off.

That is, until I was with a few friends on a Sunday evening looking for a bite to eat after visiting the DBG for the Chihuly exhibit.  The four of us decided on Thai & our friend that was driving mentioned Malee's.  We all agreed to give it a try after we realized that the other mentioned options were closed on Sunday evening.

To start, Malee's atmosphere was not bad.  The dinning room was clean (or seemed so) & was well decorated for a Thai restaurant.  The service was marginal...  Our server proceeded to explain all of the specials, all of which he pretty much said were not good.  Pretty strange, but I always appreciate the honesty, but needless to say, we ordered off of their regular menu.

The food...  The food was OK, nothing special.  I absolutely LOVE great Thai food, however, this was not much better than what you would be served at a Chinese restaurant.  Presentation was great, but the food was missing the real Thai flavors & covered with tons of sodium-rich sauce & oil.

For those of you who rave about this place, try Thai Lahna or Thai Rama for excellent authentic Thai cuisine.

Back to the COCKROACHES IN THE FOOD!!!

After the four of us had our first serving of food with rice, I went in for another serving of rice from the community bowl to try my partners dish.  Amongst the rice was a "friend" looking up at me, a COCKROACH.  Although I am vegetarian, the fact that an animal was in the rice did not freak me out.  Cockroaches, however are not a sign of cleanliness in a restaurant.  I already had my concerns after visiting the restroom to wash my hands before dinner, what a freaking mess!  But that's another show...

After finding the cockroach in the rice, I brought this to the server's attention, trying not to make a scene & upset my friends who had all already eaten from the rice bowl.  I requested a fresh bowl of rice & explained the problem.  He saw it & agreed to bring a new bowl, which he did shortly thereafter.  

One big problem that I have with Malee's is that we did not receive any sort of apology for being served a COCKROACH in our rice.  I was not looking for a free dinner, but an apology was in order for such a disgusting situation from both the server & a manager/owner would have been nice.  Obviously the server & or management did not care that they served us a COCKROACH in our food.  Obviously the management/owners DO NOT CARE about sanitation.  Obviously the management/owners DO NOT CARE about their customers health & well-being as long as they get their money.

Needless to say, I will never go back here again.  If you are looking for a good, authentic, sanitary Thai feast, try Thai Lahna or Thai Rama.Condescension is never, ever a good or acceptable customer service policy. Ever. Hey, Andy Dick lookin' pimply bastard - you didn't get the clue when I tossed it right back atcha there when I entered your sad, "we're just kind of hanging on and paying to keep the lights on" store, "buddy"??? Your Hispanic co-worker gal is nice. She gets 4 stars.  But people like you who cockily and irritatingly regard every person who comes in the door of your pathetic life as a Schlotsky's schmuck with nothing but mindless contempt shouldn't be anywhere near the front lines of ANY business. Jerks like you are a big reason why people stop going out to eat - you belong out back scrubbing or mopping something - only. The fact that you had to get in that last little desperate, passive-aggressively hostile and poison-to-a-healthy-customer-vendor-relationship - "buddy" sealed your doom as a one star loser.  I'm heading down the street to the newly-opened Paradise Bakery next time I'm in your obnoxious vicinity, guy. 

Oh, and your food is overpriced for what it is.

Manager, please take note!This location is closed.Horrible horrible horrible.....Is that the soup nazi I see in the kitchen....no its the owner...OMG stay far far away.....The staff was incredibly friendly and the doctor was nice enough and did a thorough exam dealing with the issue I was having.  However, he walked up to the front desk afterwards and demanded payment immediately.  So incredibly unprofessional, rude, and inappropriate.  I somewhat understand collecting payment upfront, but only if you have warned of that service in advance, and then let the front desk lady who is dealing with me already do her job by asking me. Dr. Checroun did not walk away or say "bye" or "nice to meet you" or "hope you are feeling better" ..he just stood there until I handed over payment...as though he really doubted I would ever pay!  Is he that bad of a doctor that he can't possibly trust someone to pay the 100.00 for the appointment or is such a bad doctor that he needs this one bill paid now because he has no patients who would ever return after their experience with him?  They have my SS, my address, my ID, my insurance card (which they take my insurance)...SEND me a bill after it goes through my insurance and wait for me to mail in my payment like every other medical office.  At the very least, thank me and say bye as you leave and don't come across desperate for money - let your front office billing staff demand the upfront payment.  But honestly, no where on your forms does it say upfront payment is demanded...every other medical office I go to in Scottsdale and Phoenix for the last 10 years has sent me a a bill after running insurance.  There is no wonder now why you were the ONLY ophthalmologist in scottsdale to have an opening that morning!Bad experience with a female dentist there. I had a bad tooth ache going in, coming home with an even worst pain on my infected tooth. 

The female doctor there is LAZY. She did a root canal for kids on me because it is a much easier procedure. I got charged "full price", $$$$$ for adult root canal.

Afterwards, she send me home without antibiotics nor pain meds on my infected tooth. It was so painful that the horrible pain kept me up all night.

I would not recommend her to anybody!I was there Friday. The comedians were amazing!!!! The venue itself is gorgeous, but...

My waitress did not acknowledge that my drink was empty for well over 20 minutes(it was wine, pretty easy to see). I had to stop her while she was walking to ask if she'd get me a refill. She walked by for the next 15 minutes with others' drinks, I had to ask for the refill and she acted as though it was a shock. I'm a waitress, I know things happen, but it happened to myself and my boyfriend at different times. 
We also got food, the chicken strips were really good, but we also got French fries, we weren't the biggest fans of them...I asked if she could take them away and she said someone else would have to come around and grab them. It just didn't make sense to me. 
The atmosphere was amazing, I hate giving a bad review, but the poor service really weighed on my experience..I had only eaten at La Fonda's Mexican food restaurant three times. The first two experiences there were great. The staff during the day is the family that actually owns the business. The service was fast, food was hot and fresh, and waiter was friendly. However, the third time I ate there was for dinner with a friend of mine. We got there and had to wait around 20 minutes for a table. The reason being is it was a Saturday night and   the place had only two servers for the whole restaurant! What a nightmare! We decided to stay and have dinner since it was already 7 pm. We both ordered there standard margarita there which tasted like salt water....no flavor! Our chips and salsa were good like the other two previous visits prior. The chicken burritos we ordered were a disappointment. The meat inside was luke warm which made me a bit nervous. How long was the meat sitting? We were so disappointed we just up and walked out, never been back since. give this place a second thought before trying them out. it seems like a hit or miss kinda restaurant.All I can say is, um no thank you...this place is completely awful. And, I have not, nor will I EVER attempt to sell anything here.  I remember being a huge BE fan when it first opened in the SF Bay Area in about 1990.  I was a starving community college student and would be ecstatic at the overstuffed bag of  cute, stylish clothes that I could purchase for less than $30 bucks.  

How times have changed.  I can't believe they are actually selling used crap like this for $15-25 a piece, and previously worn shoes generally turn me off unless they're in excellent shape with an equally awesome price.  But, $26.50 for some nasty old Target clod hopppers, WTH???  This place makes My Sister's Closet look like Neiman Marcus!!!Wow been going there for years but went there recently and was really disappointed, food was horrible, the urinal rock wall was overflowing and leaking all over my shoes and to top it off I sat in a bar stool for 30 minutes before some big shot drug dealer they like there arrived and told me I was in his seat, when I refused to move the bouncers asked me to move. Casey's FAILMy money was stolen on multiple occasions right out of my account.  They replaced it but geez then it would happen again.  I had to quit using that acct all together.  I still get emails years later now that say you just logged into your account.  What?  WTF??  No I didnt.I had been CRAVING a Really Good Croissant for a long time!  I used to go to P.croissants back in the 80's/90's and I am sure they were owned by someone different then and the Croissants were AMAZING!

Then I went to day and more then likely will never go back!  I just got a Plain Croissant and brought it home and I was SO DISAPPOINTED!  It was not flaky at all and very LITTLE taste.  Not at all like I had remembered them to be.

As a side note if anyone is looking for the best Croissant's, HANDS DOWN, Williams and Sonoma!  You get them via mail order and they come frozen, set them out the night before and bake them and they are AMAZING, my holiday treat every year now.  Keeping a box around all year is dangerous!  I have found nothing to compare to them and looks like I will stick to them!This location is slow and can't multitask. I've compained three times to corporate about this location. Keep driving and find a better location.I'm going to keep this one short (not really), went there over a year ago and I should have reviewed sooner but didn't have the chance and after hearing about a friend having a problem also at Sun Valley, I decided it's time.

Their rates were close to dealer prices with no where near the resources, knowledge, or equipment (facility).

Also I paid for the initial (main) diagnostic, got a ridiculous quote with numerous problems.

I asked which part can I have fixed to resolve the immediate problem, with the car (check engine light was on, that's why I brought it in and those codes are very specific), and he said they would have to do another diagnostic, which I would have to pay for to pinpoint what is causing the light to be on(so two full diagnostics), just to tell me the specific thing to fix to resolve the light issue.  I said, "Isn't that what the 'first' diagnostic was for, that's why I brought it in to fix the check engine light so I can pass smog test."  I won't get into the arguing any further, it's too frustrating.  I did offer to get the proper work done if he would not charge me for a second diagnostic and I also offered to be a repeat customer versus never coming back, he chose charging me for the second diagnostic and I did NOT get it at this point.

I took my phony, baloney diagnostic paperwork and left.  This was plain and simple stealing.

The problem ended up being an Oxygen sensor replacement which is cheap and I actually could have done myself, Autozone was actually able to tell me that, I had it replaced at another garage and the "Check Engine" light was better and I passed my smog.

This place is really bad, beware, it's much worse than the other place I reviewed, Auto Tech.  But both I would never, ever go to which is why this receives the lowest rating possible.  I fully got ripped off.This is not gonna be a long review but, this Burger king on Boulder Hwy.  never has ice cream cones / shakes half of the  time.  The last couple of times I went through the drive-thru they always say: "our machine is down"  Yea, only when I come in right??  The last time I went they were running a special if you buy a certain burger combo you get a free ice cream cone. So, I asked them about that and they told me "yes you get a free cone"...Ok, I said "if your machine is down, do I get an IOU??" Then there was complete silence...Maybe they didn't know what IOU stands for.  Once again.....good ole  NON CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!   They never respond to complaints or emails.  Thanks for NOTHING Burger queen. ( Sure glad Wendy's is just right down the street!! )This is an unethical, unprofessional dental office.  They scheduled my son's follow up orthodontic appointment and when we arrived said we didn't have an appointment although I had the appointment reminder card.  Also scheduled an appointment to have his mouth-guard made for sports again when we show up, no appointment although we had the appointment reminder card.  My son's orthodontic treatment ended early but they refused to remove the braces unless I gave them $1000 (the remaining balance) which I signed a contract to have debited from my account monthly.  Stay away from Aliante Dental.Found something that looked like a pubic hair on the rim of my glass... I cancelled the order, and will never return.If you want a glass of tap water while you gamble, it will cost you $2.00. This place should be avoided.Last night I stopped in for a beer for the first time and within 45 minutes I was drugged and robbed of my phone, wallet and all of its belongings-bartender was in on the scam-Connie and one of the garbage ghetto patrons.  Spent the night in the ER and now having to report all this bs
DO NOT GO HEREWe came here for a concert - which was actually great.  Leaving the hotel was a nightmare.  300 people came outside and we proceeded to wait 2 hours for a cab that wasn't going to come out in the middle of nowhere.  The hotel didn't help make it better by communicating to us where we needed to stand, what was happening and how we were going to get home.  They just let us wait out there, calling our own cabs and when approached, the staff kept blaming each other for not anticipating that people might need cabs after a huge show.   Sadly, waiting outside was better than doing anything inside as the clientele was very "sketchy" and the tables and casino was honestly, filthy.  Avoid at all costs and if you must go there, prepare to have your own transportation service pick you up at a certain time or you will be stuck there for a very, very, very long time!!Caught a local music show here. I would have to agree with a previous review on here. Newbies not welcome, too many drunks ( it just screams out "drunken brawl" to me). I wasnt too thrilled with this joint. 
The only good thing about this place was the painted backdrop on the stage.Just ordered their lunch take out special. It was supposed to be about $5 per order, and two orders came to $20. Very odd math there. Chicken fried rice was atrocious. Greasy, and had big cashews and pineapple chunks in it. Ordered a 7 on the hot scale, and it was not even a 1. Thai Beef was also very bland and basically tasted like old gray meat that had seen better days. I mean, if you're going to serve awful meat, at least spice it up a bit. I still cannot scrape the greasy paste off of my palate from this meal. There are much better Thai places in town to spend your money/time on.Worst customer service been waiting for 1.5 hours to get my car out of the lot 3 drivers and no one is able to pull my car out of the tow yard. Been told 15 min 45 min ago. The worst experience of my life!!!! The man didn't even have change.... And wasn't even positive he gave me the right number. Don't even have waiting chair to sit in! I'm sitting on kitty litter bags for a seat!We came to Vegas for a bowling tournament and we stayed at the rio for the first time and it was horrible! The room that we had smelled like smoked BBQ, I called guest services and they sent someone to ionized the room so it would not smell anymore. They asked us to  leave the room and return in two to three hours. So we did and when we came back it still smelled like smoked. I called them again and informed them that the room still smelled like smoke and they said they couldn't do anything else about it and they did not have any other rooms available. Which was fine and I totally understood. The bad part about this is that since it still smelled like smoke it triggered my asthma at night making it hard for me to sleep. 

So the day of check out I talk to the manager about the situation and he was so rude and he couldn't offer us anything to make up for our stay at the rio. The best thing he was able to do was not charge us for the resort fee. I felt like the manager did not try his best to help his customers. 

Honestly I don't think I will stay here again. 

I usually do not bad reviews but I was very disappointed at my stay here.I ordered a lo carb burger WRAPPED in Lettuce with other assorted topping s  - Received assorted toppings NOT wrapped in lettuce , in fact lettuceless .

Ordered 2 small burgers for my kids cheese only - received 2 small burgers with the works .

it's NOT rocket science it just take a little PRIDE to do that job right .  Mind you I was the ONLY customer in the drive-through and NO cars in the lot .    Now I have 2 STILL hungry kids and basically a meatloaf I have to eat with a fork and knife .  Won't be going back .

If 5 guys only had a drive through !The worst 
Need I say more they cut me gave me an attitude bad paint job bad every thing  when I told them I was not happy with the job they made it seem like I didn't know what I was talking about and that I was wrong I have my own business too and no matter what the costumer is alway right it's the professional and adult thing to do.Ya ya ya i know wtf am i doing staying here.

So i go into the room.  The shower wall has a HUGE ball of LONG hair stuck to it.

I drop my mascara.  The toilet has PUKE all down the side of it.  

My best friend stayed here and when she put her key in and opened the door, there was a couple fucking on the bed.

Need I say more?Smelly, smelly, smelly. But if you are on a strict budget and want to enjoy Vegas this is probably the way to go. When we checked in our room we noticed the bed looked like it had been slept in.  Then the washroom was filthy. We called down to get a new room. When the bell boy arrived he was in a bad mood. We tried to explain why we bothered him and he shrugged his shoulders and said "I don't care, here are your keys."Fucking pissing me off this place. We arrived today paid all our resort fees for our complimentary internet, get a room on the 4th floor facing a cement wall, will probably change rooms tomorrow, they don't have wireless here just a rj45 plug. We just tried to order room service and they only serve from 6am to 2pm! So no dinner, plus the food court is crap and the buffet and steakhouse received bad reviews!I would never recommend this hotel to anyone!! We have never been able to get into our room and we have to wait for security to come let us in each time. This is absolutely the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at and this is the worst service I have ever received. An engineer is working on our lock at 4am in the morning instead of them simply putting us in another room (which has not been an option). We have been down to the lobby many times to explain that our key doesn't work, security tested it as well and we have now gone through 9 room keys, none of which work. The compensation offered does not even come close to matching the frustration we have experienced. I am hoping that a different manager is able to resolve this situation but we will see. I will note that my review is specifically related to the management of this hotel and not the staff. Again, as a reminder, do not stay here!Came here with my family once and both my mom and I got food poisoning from eating here.  Not only that but I got it after eating a lasagna at a supposedly "nice" Italian restaurant in the hotel that we had to wait an hour to get into.  Thanks for the worse Vegas trip ever, at least the day I got sick and starting yacking everywhere was the day we left =/Circus circus is an accurate description of the type of people you will see here. It might have been nice 20 years ago but its a dump compared to any other hotel on the strip. There is plenty of things for kids to do and the steakhouse is superb. But if your net worth is over $5000 I wouldn't stay here.Horrible customer service. I will never deal with them again! I like to gamble in Vegas but going to this place will make you feel like you lost miserably. Customer service rejected me like a stripper working the Monday morning shift...Group of 8 for lunch . I did not pick the restaurant . Very disappointing , service was stiff and forced we were just numbers at a table and any request while filled was an imposition . I have had better banquet TV dinner than what was served . Again  I just felt we were passing through. Hurry up eat and leave . This review covers lunch at the hibachi tables.'Why am I here?' was the thought running through my head after walking 3+ casino lengths to get there. Oh ya, 50$ free play I got from the ridiculous time share presentation I attended....should've known that would be a joke. Can only use the voucher on machines that don't pay you any winnings and are straight up slots....was wanting to play on video poker....nope, not an option. Also, was not approached by a waitress at all. I should have known better....definite fail for me.creepy guys, gets really crowded and hot, no bathroom in bar, you have to go downstairs in the casino. they bring the girls on stage to give you shots from the communal shot bottle...they were extremely watered down, tasted like straight kool aid. the men when i went were older, creepers looking for a good time and will probably be calling the phone number from the whore cards they get from the strip when every other girl rejects them. you know the type...they stand with their arms crossed, staring at women with a weird grin. pricey drinks and rude bartenders.

 luckily we got in free because i sure as heck wouldn't pay for this place.This is the most disgusting place I've every stayed at!  I had to switch rooms 3 times.  The ladies at the desk were real b@#$?es! They acted like it was my fault the rooms were filthy,  had food on the counters,  disgusting stained chairs,  roaches,  bed bugs,  broken cabinetry, and no cold water!!  The tub was along the filth lines of a public shower at a camp site! I finally pulled up the website and said give me this or check me out. I think the smaller the building number the better the rooms.  I started off with 25 and worked my way up to 12. I finally got what I was expecting but first impression was horrible.  I will NEVER stay at this dump again! Puhtuwee!


PS... Did I mention this place was a dump?!Apart from the mediocre food, the service is worst. They don't honor yelp deals. Definitely a place to avoid.When I made the reservation I told the girl I wanted a suite, she said all the rooms were suites so I shut up and made my reservation!

Straight up, WE DID NOT CHECK IN TO A SUITE! its true.. the room is huge! A HUGE DUMP!

EVERYTHING IS OLD. The big fat tv is aquardly sitting atop the dresser, the toilet seat was so worn out from having so many asses rubbed against it that in several spots the color had faded from white to balck, the bedspread was from 1970, the blankets were thin, the AC was loud, the floors were thin, and you could literally see the lumps in the pillows and in the bed!

Needless to say, I do not want to stay here again. There are FAR too many cool places in vegas I want to try.. I just wish I hadn't tried this one.DO NOT GO!!! NEVER GO TO VOLVO... Service manager is a crook and GM is an ass.... Air conditioning never worked, tested it but as it was winter.. Couldn't tell... 
To sum it up they ended up doing more wrong then good.... Lied to my warranty company and dismissed me off as a naive woman... It wasn't until I had to mention corporate ... That the GM actually puckered and for the first time listened to me... LaRon is a LaUghing joke and has the worst techs! 
Oh and the scratches  they "fixed" ya .... it's all "orange peeled" painting.. Going to have to get it redone... Prob at my expense but WILL NOT endanger my car to them again... Run for your lives!Growing up, fondue has always been a tradition on Xmas Eve, something my mom reminded me and my dad when we were contemplating where to go after church on Saturday.  I've been there before and knew that they give you A LOT of food so I recommended we get a Wisconsin Cheese Trio and one entree (that comes with a salad).  We ordered drinks and waited.  And waited.  The waiter finally came out with the cheese plate after I hit the hostess stand for some candy to get me by.  The cheese was excellent, especially with the bread.  I was temporarily mollified with cheese and waited for the next course (Land and Sea).  And waited.  A person brought out a dirty pot and assumed that was an acceptable way to serve a very expensive entree.  I asked for a new pot and another person felt it was acceptable to wipe the pot with a dirty rag.  Rolls eyes.  The meat was good but not as much as it was in the past.  No dessert and we still rolled out of there full.  I was advised not to complain (bad karma) and left quietly.  Will not be back.  Hopefully a competitor of Melting Pot will hit the Las Vegas scene.  There were a few back in my hometown of MI that were just as good.petland is the worst pet store you want to deal with.  this is reflected in the  most horrible manager (jeffrey) any one with a store manager like this can only reflect a pet store you should avoid!!!!!!!

their pet food prices are higher than other pet stores.  petland's sale of puppies needs to be investigated in how they treat their puppies, get their puppies too young  (most likely from puppiy mills) well over priced, $1400 and  up...............................We just returned home, Indiana,from Vegas.  Four of us.  We ask " What was the least favorite thing we did in Vegas.  We all said Memphis Barbecue.  I'm not sure who is writing some of these reviews, but, Do not waste your money here! Sauce was watered down, but I don't think I would have liked it anyway.  Cole slaw was spoiling, turning yellow, magic dust was great on the macaroni and cheese, onion rings were good. Very disappointing, especially after all of the awards they had received thirteen years.  Don't eat here!I am a regular at a number of Tropical Smoothie locations-- I absolutely LOVE the Thai chicken wrap with Gardein faux meat. One recent evening, I stopped into this T.S. and ordered just that. The boy with the glasses and large gauged ears took my order. His tag was not visible and he did not give me a receipt, though, so I do not know this name. Upon repeating my order back to me, everything was correct. Once the order was complete, as I took my bag, I asked, 'With the Gardein chicken, yes?' To which he said, 'Yes'.

When I got home, I unwrapped my wrap and had a feeling that I should take a look before biting into it. Indeed, my wrap was made with real chicken, NOT Gardein.

I quickly drove back to Tropical Smoothie and confronted this staff member about the error. When I asked, "Why did you make my wrap with real chicken, even though I emphasized Gardein before preparation AND asked you when you handed me the wrap whether it was Gardein or not?"

His reply: "It must have slipped my mind".

Completely unacceptable and absolutely disgusting. Had I not been familiar with what Gardein looks like, I likely would have eaten an entire wrap with regular chicken. I am too scared to go back to any T.S. now, and hope this employee is reprimanded. Thank you for messing up one of my favorite to-go meals!I can only speak for this location but the Thrifty here sucks!! I booked through Hotwire and got the bullet on this round of russian roulette. 

Let me set the scene.....Friday afternoon around 4:00. We walked up and were second in line, "sweet", I thought foolishly. It took 35 minutes for the ONE person in front of us to be helped. There were two agents for the Thrifty side and the one chunky black guy in the suit was chatting it up with people for about 5 minutes out in the lobby area after escorting someone down to the car pick up area. Then he comes up and screws around on the computer for nearly 5 minutes before seeing a large breasted women with a low cut dress in the Dollar line and helping her before us (and we're a good looking couple in our late 20's not exactly hard to look at)! She literally had just walked up and was helped immediately while our line had now grown to at least 15 people. I was about to explode at this point but calmer heads prevailed and I could not be 100% sure he was a Thrifty agent since he was right by the line between the two (after we had been helped I saw him helping the person behind us so he was definitely a Thrifty agent). The older white lady with red hair helped us and was very pleasant but at this point I was not really interested in her chit chat. 

Soooo if getting a car in a timely manner and being helped by professional agents is not a big deal then by all means choose Thrifty! If you are a normal person and hate poor customer service and crappy management then look elsewhere. You have been warned!!We ate there last night, the first time we've been back there in years.  I Had fish and chips, YUK, they were greasy and tasted about as good as frozen fish. The fries were not crisp. My husband had the hamburger. It was OK but nothing great. The atmosphere in the restaurant is bland. We won't go backI love Mexican food. I always get a cheese enchilada with rice. While we were in Vegas this past weekend, we all wanted Mexican food and were going to go to Carlos and Charlie's at the Flamingo but thought it probably wouldn't be the best place for authentic Mexican. We were just about to pull out of valet parking at the Flamingo when one of the valet girls offered to give us a few suggestions for alternative Mexican places. She suggested Casa Don Juan or Ciscos (Sisqos? sp?). We went with CDJ.
My cheese enchilada had zero flavor, and the rice was basically the same. The enchiladas were ridiculously spicy, but spicy doesn't matter if there is no flavor behind it. My grandma got the chili relleno (which she gets at all Mex restos) and she didn't like the looks of it. It was soaked in grease and so much cheese you couldn't see if there was even a chili in there. She took one bite, waited a few minutes, and then felt sick. Not good. My grandpa got the bacon wrapped shrimp  and said it was alright but had no flavor, either. 
Chips and salsa were not memorable at all.
Staff was friendly, but that didn't make up for the bland/overly greasy food.

Cheese enchiladas 2/10
Rice 2/10
Chips and salsa 3/10As I pulled in, I see two employees smoking out back. I walked into the restaurant, there are two more employees eating at a table. One of the smokers ran in to take my order. After my order was taken, the other smoker came in to help fix my order. Neither washed their hands. The two employees in the dining room just sat and stuffed their face while making a complete mess. All of this happened at 11:45. You would think thy lunch time would be the time to see employees at their best. If this is their best, I would hate to see what happens when they're not taking their job seriously. 

I will not return to this location, EVER!

The down side to this review; the food was good and fresh.Forget this place! Spent thousands of dollars here trying to hold an old car together for my teenager. Recently took it in and the repairs outweighed the value of the car. They still charged me $100.00 to tell me that basically I was screwed! Thanks for the loyalty American Auto Care.  Never again!Horrible management. Understaffed and poor service. 20-30 min wait is regular during peak times for a simple wrap and a Smoothie. Avoid unless u like being overcharged for mediocre food.Our family has been bringing our cars into this place for years, we always felt like they did a good, honest job. Lately they have really tired to screwed me over. About 6 months ago my car would shake at high speeds so I brought it into them and they told me I needed new struts for $950. Luckily my new boss used to be a mechanic, he took a look and said there was no way my fairly new Toyota would need struts this soon and that all I needed was new tires and to have them balanced and rotated. I took my car in to another shop and that is exactly what they recommended and said my struts were fine, saved me $550. Then a couple weeks ago I went to get an oil change from Purrfect Auto (I figured there wouldn't be any issues from just getting an oil change) and they had written on my invoice 'Needs new oil gasket $450', but they did not tell me this, it was only written on my invoice. I was already home when I noticed this on the invoice but didn't call to ask, I just figured they were trying to sell me on some new parts. So come yesterday my car is leaking oil, my car has never leaked oil. I had my boss look at my car again. He lifted it up at his house and we saw that it was the way the guys at Purrfect Auto did my oil change, the oil pan was cracked and they used tape to tape up the hole!!! And the oil gasket was fine. I'm having someone else fix the oil pan for $50. I am never going there again and have already told all of my family members who have went there to never go there again. My mom was actually on her way to get an oil change from there today and she went somewhere else.Umm.... this place needs to reevaluate their idea of what HOUSE MUSIC is....  I could have made an exception for my $20 fireball on ice iiif and only if for the 1hr I was there the "DJ" knew of more than (literally) 2 beats... I had more fun in the hotel room which is sooo sad considering I am in VEGAS!! I know its an after hours club...   and most people are already fucked up and don't care where they are at...but this is just pathetic!!!What an incredible rip-off!  Outdated interior, food was just average, service was slow.  Most importantly $165 for two people for two entrees, an appetizer and two sodas.  Avoid this tourist trap at all costs.
When we left, I felt like I had just been robbed.  I might has well have been playing dollar slots.Good burger.  Just as good as Red Robin, but not better and twice as pricey.  Ok service but poor atmosphere.  LOUD!  If you want blasting noise, RumJungle is just a short walk away.  Why not leave the loud dance tunes up to the REAL DJ's?  This place is catering to the young d-bag crowd.  No thanks, never again.I would like to preface my review by saying that I have no bad things to say about the food.  We opted for the lamb burger and were perfectly happy with the outcome.

The service, on the other hand, was inexcusably bad.  The bartender was inattentive, impatient, rude and did not listen to us at all.  Worse yet, the manager supported this kind of behavior and had no sympathy whatsoever for what they were choosing to call a "miscommunication".  We waited almost 45 minutes for a burger which we later found out was never even put in because the bartender was not listening.  After calmly inquiring after our burger, we were told that we never ordered one, but that it would be put in on the fast track.  Apparently the fast track meant we would have to wait yet another 30 something minutes for a medium rare burger.  Under the circumstances, I'm not sure if the burger was even good or if we were just starving.By far the worst meal we had in Vegas.

When we arrived to place our reservation in person (after no one answered the phone) we were ignored for several minutes by two hosts who were having a personal conversation. 
Our waiter took the rude to a whole new level. He didn't even acknowledge my wife for close to ten minutes, speaking solely to and making eye contact only with me. He actually dropped his "game face" before out of eyesight after leaving the table and rolled his eyes.

The meal started off well with decent margaritas (although the bar only accepts cash or room-charges). The meal then quickly deteriorated. After enjoying some good bread and muffin (one muffin for two people) we had a chicken quesadilla for an appetizer, which was tasty, but overly salty. I ordered the lamb medium rare and it came raw and purple. My wife ordered the sixteen spice chicken which was sickly sweet. Tried the cioppino...it was edible at best. Overly fishy smelling in general with mussels that were certainly past their prime. Overall, the food was overly sweet and generally bad.

If you want to experience a good $100 plus meal in vegas don't eat here. There are much better places worth your time and money. I recommend B & B Ristorante in the Venetian.Just checked out of this hell-hole hotel. Don't blame the staff for this mess, however...they were both friendly and helpful. The problem is that this place reeks of cheap. Yes there's a pricey Kartell Ghost Chair here and there, but other than that the negative reviews people have mentioned about the run-down conditions of this place are true. Think IKEA meets Howard Johnson's and you've got the idea.

They did upgrade us from our $300 king pool view room to an apartment...an enormous space with a separate living room, dining room, and three private terraces. But that only meant there was three times as much that needed to be gutted and re-done. Shame on you, Morgans Hotel Group, for misrepresenting this property. Next time I'll be staying at the Sanctuary at Camelback.I would rather be a freegan and dumpster dive then ever swing into the Rainforest Cafe again. I would rather eat.....
....at the worst Applebee's in America
....vending machine food
....my own flesh

Now, Rainforest could be fun if you were 12 and drunk. Then the overly fried foods and canned sauces could cure your munchies. I would have rather had Totino's pizza rolls than the nasty appetizer combo we shared. The plant and animal filled space could really use the services of Merry Maids. Really. How do you clean all that crap? 

The rainforest "thunderstorm" is as exciting as the one in the produce section at Safeway. So if you have kids who like to drink, you might have a good time here. Otherwise I say stay home and check your trash like a good freegan.Just returned from my 1st trip to Vegas. We wanted class so we stayed at the Bellagio. I flew in from CA and arrived at noon.  My friend was coming from the north and her flight was delayed 8 hours.  Because Expedia did not have my name on the itinerary, Bellagio was not going to let me check in.  They finally relented when I pulled out an email addressed to me by my friend (who booked the room) with the reservation attached.  Customer service?   Terrible.  
In addition, the hotel is dated, dumpy and has the worst wall art ever.  
We had 2 free buffet visits listed on the Expedia itinerary/reservation.  At check out, we had to pay additional fees ($13) as they said the 'free' visits were only worth $60. Nowhere on any of our documents did it list the cost of the buffet as %60 or as anything else.  Cheap, cheap, cheap trick.  The food at the buffet sounded grand but was mediocre at best. Cheap cuts of meat and pre-frozen, thawed shrimp. 
We had breakfast at Cafe Bellagio and paid cash. It was $60 for 2 for a Denny's quality meal.  However, at checkout, we were also charged $18.99 for breakfast.  No explanation was given. 
I have stayed at 5 star hotels all over the world and I cannot understand why the Bellagio is viewed as opulent. I would never stay there again and would never recommend it.This hotel like all the others need to STOP CATERING TO SMOKERS PLEASE. If you truly enjoy breathing second-hand smoke while gambling, walking through the casino/hotel, eating, etc. then this is the place for you. It was really hard for me to like this place. The rooms are average. They charge to even drink the water which is really sad. This was my last stay here.I stayed at Paris for a holiday weekend and apparently over paid. My wife and I have stayed at several different hotels in Vegas from Excalibur to Caesars so I have come to understand that you get what your pay for (e.g., the more expensive the room, the better the service and quality). 

Paris broke that rule. From the reception to the buffets, I have to say the service in this place is ridiculously sub par. Unless, as a coworker pointed out, they were going for the authentic French treatment of Americans, in which case they were spot on. 

The room was plain with a horrible view. Something I would expect from Bally's or another generic resort, but for Paris (and the price) I was very disappointed. We were on a nonsmoking floor, but could still get occasional wafts of smoke in the room. Not sure if from a floor below, but seemed strange. 

Overall a lack luster experience. I won't be going back. Even free would be hard to get me back.Our first stay here and it will be our last. We were given an incorrect room at check in, we went back down and had it corrected with no form of apology. The girl at the desk actually seemed upset that I wanted the room I had booked. 

The carpets are disgusting, the bathroom fixtures are junk, etc etcBoy where do I begin. I booked a strip view room at this hotel about two months in advance. I was a late check in and called the hotel earlier in the day around noon to inform them that I would be checking in around 11PM. As expected, I arrived on the property around 10:30pm and saw that there was a HUGE line for check in. had to wait in line for about 45 minutes until I finally saw a front desk agent.

The agent told me that the strip view room I had booked was no longer available, whatever that means. I told the agent that I had fully paid for a strip view room and anything else was unacceptable. In short, the agent told me there was NOTHING he could do except put me up in a non-strip view room, then give me a call the next day around 3PM so I could move to a strip view room.

My temporary room was small, bland, utterly boring with a view of the 15 freeway. I waited until 4PM the next day and was not given a call on my room line, nor my cell, as promised by the agent from the night before. I ended up having to call the front desk and after being transferred to 4 different people, I was finally given a room to transfer to with a strip view. I asked that the difference in price from the night before be refunded to me, or comped in some sort of way. My request was denied.

Overall, had a horrifying time at this hotel. I was straight up robbed of money for a specific room I paid for fully in advance. If you're not going to give me the type of room I reserve, why even have reservations? Never returning to this dirty hotel ever again, not even to gamble, drink, or eat at any of its restaurants.Recently stayed at the Monte Carlo with my sister for Spring Break/Bachelorette. We arrived around 9pm and checked in quickly. Our room was the very last room on the 8th floor. View of parking garage. There was some long black curtains with a stand hanging in front of the door to the room across from us and it looked like they just needed a place to stick it and decided next to our room! Also, there was a tray of beer and old food that looked like it had been sitting there for days. We had to walk around it each time we went to our room. 

The room: BLAH. The floor was stained (looked like many people had thrown up on it over the years...) there was candy on the floor from the previous guests. Other than that it seemed clean enough. Nothing special at all, no fridge, no wifi, and all the outlets but one were taken so no charging your phone next to the bed! The safe didn't work, it was open and wouldn't shut. I called the front desk and they sent up security who demanded my ID like a criminal. They said any time they open the safe they have to check ID. I proceeded to tell him the safe was OPEN and nothing was in it so why do I need to show ID? He snapped at me that if I had a problem with their policies to take it up with the front desk. I did and they gave me a $50 credit. They also had to send up 2 more people before the safe got fixed. Also complained about the food sitting outside of our room for over a day and they finally came and picked it up. 

Went to the pool the next day. It was good enough but I've been to better in Vegas. Also the wave pool was dirty lots of "debris" in it. Came back to the room and it had only been halfway cleaned. Again called to the front desk and they offered to send someone up but at that point we were trying to get ready for a night out so we declined. On our way out we heard someone else on our floor say their room was only halfway cleaned too. The next day we had a housekeeping supervisor come to our room and tell us she thoroughly cleaned our room. Parts of the room looked spotless and then parts were still not done like the day before. 

Last day for check out I wanted to just do express checkout, reviewed my bill and the $50 credit was not applied. Had to wait in a very long line to speak with someone to get it applied. Overall I was dissatisfied with our trip and I will not be staying here again. They put us in the farthest room, looked like they were using our hallway as a storage area, and a trash area for room service. Not happy at all.After they cancelled my reservation for no reason, embarrassing me in front of my group, I will never stay here again.  
Sad,cause it was my favorite hotel and recommended it highly to all who were coming to Vegas.For starters, the shuttle service took over an hour to come pick us up from the airport. It appeared that they only had one small van/bus to use, but tons of extremely overpriced limos (but be prepared to pay $12+per person for a one way trip on the van.) The driver was very rude,impatient, and yelled at passengers. The majority of the hotel staff was extremely rude and unfriendly. Check-in/out was a long ordeal. The room was subpar. The mini-fridge didn't work, and if we wanted to empty it out to use for other stuff (we were there a week), it was going to cost $25, plus $50 for every day it was empty.Be super careful not to even touch something in it as it's electronically monitored and will charge you whether you drank/ate it or not. We spoke to a manager to have it fixed on the first day, they came to fix it an hour before our check out. The maid service was ridiculous (though we were informed they are contracted out). They barely cleaned the rooms, never replaced towels, threw the shampoos/soaps onto the counter and everyday came an hour earlier and would knock even with a do not disturb sign hanging.The first night we requested extra blankets, 2 hrs. later we still had no blankets, called down a second time and after 45 minutes, they brought up a thin, disgusting blanket.A few of the lights were burnt out, and once they were fixed, the room was still very dark. The couch (with hideaway bed) was outdated, ugly, falling apart and extremely uncomfortable. The entire casino and lobby smelled overpowering and horrid. The food (even for Vegas) is really overpriced and mediocre. The spa was just as bad, one lady even scolded us like children and literally yelled at us b/c we were self touring the locker rooms--even though we explained that the spa front desk attendant had told us to do so.  The hotel itself is a pain in the ass to navigate, to get to the guest elevators, you have to either navigate through the casino or through the shopping plaza. On a weekend night, forget it, with Club Tao there, the place is a madhouse and the entrance line takes up the entire foyer. We ate at I love Burgers, the staff was fantastic, but we all got really sick within hours of eating there. The "resort fee" doesn't include the fitness center.  For all of its reputation, The Venetian was extraordinarily disappointing. In fact, when it came time to gamble/shop, we went to other hotels. We were not about to give them any more of our money. While there, I ran into at least three other guests who had the same and worse problems as I did. Next trip to Vegas, we'll be staying elsewhere...perhaps the Bellagio, or MGM.Arrived straight from airport checked in used Valet Parking thinking my New Mimi Cooper would be safe only to have it delivered to me the next day with 5, yes five big door dings wow so amazing they made a report but could care less. Instead of a 5 star hotel should be 5 dent. Seriously though want your car jacked up give it to the Valet, god dam amazing they could be so careless i am in total disbelief.  If you have a nice car do yourself a favor and park it yourself the Valet is free and now i know why. I will never ever stay here again and if i didn't have a package deal would check out today. This type of vandalism simply there is no excuse for none zip nada. The repair will cost hundreds to fix and now it will be a civil action more crap to deal with. 
The rooms are nice the food is good but they lack in quality control with customer owned property and to say I am disappointed in their actions would be an understatement.  My 14yr old son knows better so I wonder what else they did,  I never checked the mileage when I gave my vehicle to them. We simply will never return and I certainly hope anyone with a nice auto takes my advice and park it yourself. The Hotel was proactive to make a security report but this type of headache I didn't need and normally when you give your vehicle to valet you get the best care well was sadly mistaking and have never had a valet experience like this before 5 dents were not created by one person this is their whole valet team and I would fire all of them if I had any say in this matter. When the vehicle was delivered there was not one dent or scratch. We won't return they have no respect for customers property.Our bad experience started with the lady who answered when I called to set a resv. She sounded like she wasn't very happy and didn't make me feel good about planning to go to Delmonicos.  
We get there and the hostess simply said "follow me" she did not make eye contact or even ask "how's your evening?" She walked so fast to our table it was hard to keep up.  She sat us, gave us a napkin, said nothing at all, and walked away.  (Also they only have white napkins.. I'm used to fine dining where your napkin, either white or black, be offered to go with your ensemble.)
Next, our server(s), didn't seem to care that we were dining there.  Not sure if they judged based on skin color, age, and style of clothes, but it felt like they did.  After offering us drinks and giving us menus, it was about an 8 to 10 minute wait to see our server again.. Mind you that we'd chosen what we'd have for dinner and had our menus closed a majority of that time.
Overall for service from beginning til end was way below par for such a place.  We did not feel welcomed nor that they gave 2 funks about us.
FOOD:
My bone in rib eye was ordered medium and came out medium well, which made it particularly dry and tough.  My spouses bone in rib eye was cooked correctly (medium), but was nothing to call home about.
I ordered my steak Oscar style.  The asparagus was the highlight of our dinner and the crab seemed a but overlooked and dry.
We also had a lobster tail each, which came de-shelled and on top of the rib eye.  Drawn butter was brought out but lemon was not, nor offered.
We had the New Orleans style creamed spinach.. The only "new Orleans" about it was the name.  The spinach tasted fresh but it was about a 3.5/5 on overall taste and quality.
For the price there are many better options in Las Vegas (Mastro's ocean club; the capital grille, del frisco's..).  
We will surely never return.I was walking down the Strip with relatives from out of town when they commented they were thirsty. At their behest we went into this McDonald's.

The line was long and ill-managed. Only one register was open despite the 30 or so people in line.

Most of my companions got their soda right away. One person ordered a coffee, which took 20 minutes to receive.Went here cause we saw it on TV and I have to say, NEVER AGAIN! We shoulda walked out when we opened the door, it smelled like puke! It was the dirtiest, stinkiest, hole in the wall bar I've ever walked into to. There was trash cans lined up against the wall, the locals weren't very nice and that Bacon Martini, OMG! That martini is the worst thing ever. We did have the Bacon Bloody Mary and it was freakin' phenomenal! That was the only thing good about this establishment. If you're lookin' for a place where miserable locals hang out this is it. I don't recommend it for 1 second.I am a Total Rewards member and got an attractive looking email promoting the new and improved Quad.  Well, the Imperial Palace(IP) was neither new, nor improved.  Just getting to the parking garage was a mess.  But I figured they hadn't renovated that area yet.  Then we rode the elevator to hotel, and were disgusted by the carpet in the elevator.  We thought, "They couldn't afford to lay new carpet in the renovation?"  Then as we continued in to the registration area we realized there was no renovation done to the casino.  But we remained optimistic during our two hour wait in the registration line that at least the room was remodeled.  Alas, we were wrong again.  We stayed in a deluxe room and the front desk clerk said we were in an updated room that had been remodeled 4 or 5 years ago, NOT the classic room that has NEVER been remodeled.  Really Cesars?  NEVER?  Anyway, we got to our room and it was on the same level as say an Econolodge or Super 8 motel.  Clean, but plain and cheap.  If you don't really care where you stay, and don't care about service, this place would do.  Would I ever recommend it?  Heck no.  And the Quad? I have no idea how the name could be changed when the whole place is just a thirty year old mess.WORST Vegas hotel EVER! Room had an iPod-capable system, but did not have enough connectors for every room, so no personal music. Radio was broken and they did not replace it, so no music at all. Did not even have an alarm clock radio in room. TV reception was broken where half of the tv would freeze on a commercial during the show. Air conditioning blew up, leaving our entire room (beds and bags) covered in dust chunks. Maid service NEVER showed up, even after two complaints!

Managers are awful. Talked to one manager who said all he could do was give us room service in our dust-filled room that had still yet to be cleaned, even the next day! The second manager was just as useless. I called front desk to talk to him again and they put me on hold for 20 minutes, then sad he would call me back. Never got the call. 

You know the hotel is absolutely horrible when the people that work there laugh about how many complaints they get and say that the hotel (that employs them) sucks.

We would have been better off staying in a shit box that knows it's a shit box, rather than pretending to be decent.This hotel is a waste of money. There was a flood in our bathroom and when the hotel moved us, they DOWNGRADED us!!!!!! It was not a major weekend and the hotel was NOT booked to capacity! The manager was unproffessional, had a ghetto attitude from the beginning of our conversation and she disrespectful when we left the hotel.  I think her name was Anya and there was no higher manager at the hotel on the weekend, they only work during the week. She was HORRIBLE. Not to mention, the staff all smelled of cigarettes and they had so customer service, let alone, hospitality. 

dont downgrade because the price is right, the headache is not worth it.Booked a room here months in advance.
Got an email a week before saying they were doing renovations.
They told me they'd move me to another hotel.
I requested that I be fully refunded my deposit and charged no further.
They refunded me.
Then they charged me again.

I actually really like this casino, but the hotel is TERRIBLY run.WOW!!! God awful horrible!!! I was looking forward to my Vegas trip, hoping it would be the vacation I needed. Instead, I was totally pissed of during my week in Vegas mainly b/c of the Luxor hotel. I chose the Luxor b/c the room photos looked nice on their website...of course. When I got into my room, the first thing I noticed was that the bed sagged. The bedding looked like it had been on the bed since the 90s. The furniture was very worn (I didn't sit on it). The lighting was awful...too dark (like vampires were staying there). 

And then the bathroom...MOLD all over the ceiling and shower wall. Rust on the bathroom door. My room smelled like smoke, I couldn't sleep in the bed, my neck hurted...kept waking up. I wanted to relax on my vacation, but unfortunately my room was not an inviting space. I will never stay at the Luxor again. 

The casino area is nice (of course), but as soon as you step into the elevator to go up to the rooms...that's how they get you. There should not be cracks in the walls...The Luxor is a rundown DUMP!!!

They reduced my bill after I complained about the hell-hold dump I stayed in. 

DO NOT STAY AT THE LUXOR!!!!!


Oh, and the Criss Angel Show....OMG WTF SMH...I wanted to walk out of it, thank God I got a free ticket, otherwise I would have started booing him. He is a fraud, there's nothing special about him.One star is for the awesome bread they serve you after you order.  

Where do I start? Our cocktails were horrible; we ordered Sangria, and I swear it was something a kid breaking into his parents liquor cabinet would make: horrible. I didn't even bother finishing mine.

The food: my husband ordered the Alaskan Salmon, I ordered the pasta special for the night. BOTH of these were horrible. The food was SO salty that you couldn't taste ANY flavor except salt. Our food came out TOO quick, that it leaves me wondering if maybe certain items are plated in advanced? 

Our Server would be better suited at a lower class establishment. He bombarded us as soon as we sat down; we had no chance to even look over our menus. When we didn't order cocktails straight away, we didn't see him again for ten minutes.  He didn't even bother explaining the specials at all, and yes there is an insert inside the menu, but you would think at least he would do some kind of introduction into the specials. Our food arrived, and our server would pop up now and then to say things like, "Taste good?" or "How's the taste?" It was strange. He was plain crass, and he didn't seem to really care much about our experience at all.  You think for menu items costing in the range of $26 all the way up to $54 a plate, that you would get stellar service; sadly this is NOT the case.

The worst part was the bill: $131.00 for food that I could've gotten at the Olive Garden. I was so burned when we left this place. I was totally shocked when I came here and read that it was getting 4 star reviews! Do not go here. Stay as far away as you can. 

 Good things: Our waters were always refilled. The bread basket was delish. The restaurant has got some killer decor.Worst f'in club in all of Las Vegas.  I swear the people that run the show here are absolute dumbasses.  

Granted, before I start the bashing of the club, I did not get table service, which I'm sure would be great, but if I pay $450 a bottle I am going to a nice club, not this old fart saggy balls pretentious POS club.  

Since when is a MOB of people considered organized?  The VIP entrance area is exactly that, its a mob and contest to see who can be biggest douche and shove yourself to the front so they can talk to the almighty people with the clipboards.  Thankfully we have a few of those guys in the group and we got to the front pretty fast, sorry to any little ladies that got trampled but its a kill or be killed system.

So we got passed the enormous normal line (if anyone ever stands in those, figure something out cause its easy to get around.  ), through the VIP mob, only to be graciously placed in another line to pay.  $40 to get in for guys,  whatever its Labor Day weekend and we pregamed quite a bit.

I should have just burned the $200 we wasted to get in, because at least then this place would not have gotten our money.  They obviously dont keep capacity numbers and they let EVERYONE in this weekend.  The club itself is so hard to get around with all the narrow passageways already, and pack it to the brim with drunk asses and fake boobies and moving around becomes a 20 minute marathon.  The one itty bitty dance floor was so crowded it was stupid, more people were bumping into others than actually dancing.  Roof, also packed, another 20 minute shoulder to shoulder trek to get from one side to the other.    Needless to say we left in about an hour after getting some exercise walking around

Stick to the good clubs, XS, TRyst,  Perfecto at Rain, Lavo are some of my favs.  But I'd take body shots of gasoline off of a fat chick before coming here again.Had my worst Vegas night club experience here ever and I've done a lot of Vegas!  Pure has the worst service and downright scams people here.  We had a group of 20 and they pulled a bait and switch trying to practically extort a thousand bucks from us.  Stay as far away from pure as you can!my meal was fantastic.... pasta with scallops and shrimp... nice bottle of chianti... on the pateo... I would have given it a good rating .....

but...
.
the roasted chicken that my girlfriend had undeniably gave her food poisoning and she spent 36 hours immediately afterward face down in our hotel room at New York, New York. 

That sucked!

So, buyer beware!My husband and I had comps to use at this Casino for food and beverage, so we decided to stop by The Buffet in the morning before catching our flight. 

For the record - We both LOOOOOOOOOVE buffets! Wynn, Wicked Spoon, Aria buffet - Yes, please!

We cannot say that we love this particular buffet. One thing we liked is that the drinks are self serve there. It's nice not having to rely on someone to bring you a drink in a timely manner, etc. 

As far as the good goes: Meh. The buffet was not as big as most other large casino buffets, and the variety was not very good. Except for the eggs/omelettes that were cooked per request in front of you, the food was overly processed, congealed, hard, dry, stale.... not so good. The fresh fruit was the best thing on the menu that morning. I tried a variety of dishes, as did my husband. 

Many of the food items could have been good, but it's like they half as*ed it, almost. There was 'coffee cake' there, but it was more like flavorless dry bread/cake with brown food coloring swirled through the top half. No taste of cinnamon, no brown sugar evident anywhere... a real impostor. The mac and cheese looked old, dry, and shriveled. The desserts looked extremely factory made, so much so that even though I am a sugar fiend, I didn't try most of them. 

It says a LOT when my husband and I, who NEVER EVER turn down copious amounts of food, walked through the entire buffet without being tempted by a single thing. Based on looks alone, we weren't interested. That's never happened before. I love Twinkies, after all. I love Ding Dongs. I love lamp. 

The point is, we had to work hard to put anything on our plates, and then when we sat down, we each about 2.5 bites worth of the items. IF that. 

This buffet may have better offerings on weekends or during the Sunday brunch, but yesterday, Wednesday morning, it was nothing for them to be proud of.

That's all I have to say about that.

P.S. Neither my husband nor I are overweight, despite our frequent buffet outings. Calories don't count in Vegas. Let that be a lesson to you!Now, it may be a little harsh to rate the Spice Market Buffet (inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel) only one star, but honestly, the standards should be raised significantly because: (1) it's $30.00, (2) it's in one of the better Vegas hotel/casinos, and (3) it's in VEGAS. 

Sadly, Spice Market Buffet is much more comparable to Hometown Buffet than anything else. The food was all either too tasteless, too greasy, or looked disgusting. Pretty much the only food I was even remotely satisfied with is the cocktail shrimp and King crab legs. NOTHING ELSE in the entire buffet was appetizing. 

Hands down one of the worst expensive buffets in Vegas. I would happily spend the extra $10-20 to go to Bellagio or Wynn's buffets.um. it's a giant line.  and i didn't even have to wait in "the line."  period.it is ridiculously over priced! and not worth it. When they say some big celeb is coming, they bump up the price and then the person performs for 2 songs. I've now been here for "black eyed peas" (only one of them) and Drake. There are many clubs in Vegas and honestly tao is not worth it.This place is embarrassing! The service was terrible, the management was rude and unorganized. The food was not good and way over priced. The setting is so fake classy... I have no idea how it has managed to keep up in Kierland Commons! Take your time and money elsewhere.I have been here 5 times (which is 4 times too many) with my wife and kids and have been thoroughly disappointed EVERY time. There has not been a time where I've ordered something and they either didn't have it, or it was horrible.

How this place remains open as part of the chain is a mystery to me. At least the service is half decent, unlike the food they serve.Booked this because we are traveling with our girls, 13 and 10.
I wasn't entirely sure what to expect and found myself beyond disappointed.
One star is due to the fact that my girls both had a great time....so that eases the pain of the money I paid and will never see again.

7pm show last night....we were told to be there at 6:15 to watch the start of the parade some of the members do.  This runs through the casino.  Kinda cool drumming and lights....we didn't follow it around but went inside to get seated.

Small theatre and not a bad seat in the place.  We chose to not be in the splash zone.  They didn't get with much but some paint and a bit of misc stuff.

Basically it is a mime show/comedy show.  I kept getting excited for something fun to happen but it never really did  They pull members of the audience which takes forever....then the use of them is just bizarre.  They interact some but maybe it was all lost on me.  I thought it was stupid.

The real talent lies in the back up musicians.  Fun to hear them but they don't do much.  

Slow moving, not really funny and lame in my opinion.  Kept thinking about what I paid and had to let that go... maybe $20 or $30 a ticket I would have been ok but 4 tickets at $75 each.  ugh.

Helpful info to know:

Food inside: popcorn, few beer options is all I saw.

Seating:  All seats are good but further back on the second level you are under a balcony and my girls couldn't get a touch on the cool balls that eventually get tossed around.  Not a big deal though.  

Tickets: If you have MLife and book direct, you get the better seating and pricing. If you buy off strip, you will get a voucher to redeem at the box office and I was told they give you the seats in the far back.  Which would have worked and you could have moved up to open seats I'm sure.

Overall, my girls had fun and it was family friendly.  Hard to find in Vegas but I wish I would have booked a magic show instead.  It isn't a Vegas vacation w/o seeing a show, but this just was lost on me.Really guys, 4 stars?

My whirlwind journey through Las Vegas ended at what I had hoped to be the "world's best buffet" (at least that's what the billboard said). Instead I ended up with a raunchy, gut-busting round of queasiness. Both before and after the meal.

If the nightmare of the congested self-pay line wasn't enough to send you running, the depressing atmosphere and the equally depressing-looking food will have you demanding a refund. The dining area attempts to set a mood with deeply colored furniture and requisite ambient lighting, but fails miserably as it actually feels like a dark and dank dungeon--reminder that you are in for an inescapable, nonrefundable world of hurt. Sampling a little bit from every corner, I found the dim sum (particularly the sui mai and har gow) to be bland, barely lukewarm, and... rubbery? The quesadillas were cold and, the pancakes were soggy (even before I put syrup on them), the crab legs were forgettable... in fact most of the food was forgettable as I can honestly not remember what else I ate. I filled up 5 plates with sad looking food that, for the most part, made me pretty sad to eat.

I know what you all are thinking: it's the Carnival "World" Buffet and it deserves props for combining American, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, etc. cuisine. But couldn't it, and in fact shouldn't it, be executed *better*?Long wait in line, long wait for food. Food was bad, I'd rather have something in any food court. The French dip sucked. Roast beef tasted like it's been in the fridge for a long time, and bland. The au jus was bland, dipping the sandwich in it made the sandwich lose flavor. Seriously it's not one of the worst, but THE worst french dip I've ever had.   Waiter asked what bread my friend wanted for her omelet but the bread did not come.  Service was mediocre.  $100 for 4 entrees and 2 appetizers, normally it would be an ok Vegas price but the food was just ridiculously bad.  The $16 French dip tasted worse than what I can get at Arby's or Quizno's.A-Not okay.

This room used to be really cool and intimate.  They opened up the 4th wall to the casino and installed a bunch of bigscreens to broadcast sportscenter.  Cheesey.

Enough with the mac and cheese and sliders and corndogs and popcorn and other garbage-y snacks.  We came for dinner.  The menu is full of stuff that jumped the shark 5 years ago, including the $5000 hamburger gimmick.

2 servers asked us what kind of bottled water we'd like and nobody came to take a drink order so we left after 15 minutes.  I know the economy is bad but Hubert should be ashamed of the joke this place has become.  Dumbed down and nonsensical menu.

Caesar salad, french onion soup, sliders, popcorn, fried chickpeas, gazpacho.  Enough.  Please stop.Worst place ever!!!!! The food was alright...over priced for the portions they serve...

however we simply asked at the beginning of the meal to split the bill...but no they didn't!!! Put everyone in a bad mood and ruined our night! And all the manager could say was sorry. not even an acknowledgement of their mistake! Never again!this restaurant is disgusting. my shrimp was overcooked, my sister's meat undercooked, and the service was neglectful and apathetic. completely overpriced for the crap they call food. i would never eat there again.The one star is for our cute and friendly waitress, and the saving grace of the place. She kept our drinks topped off and was very attentive. Her name has been omitted to protect the innocent.

The lack of 4 stars is for the food and atmosphere. The hubski and I went with a couple of friends on a Saturday night- a night when The Keg, The Cheesecake Factory, and PF Changs would all have a line out the door. MBFGR was empty.
We sat outside to enjoy a nice Arizona May evening. We all ordered variations on their Pita sandwich. I had the chicken souvlaki with a cup of the avegolemono soup of the side. The hubski had the same with fries, and our friends had the chicken breast pita with Greek salad. They apparently go quite often and order the same thing. They were happy. Hubski was happy.
I, on the other hand, was not. 
I started with the soup, although it had come at the same time as my pita. The top was cold and the bottom was hot. There were thick chunks of what was formerly soup skin floating around in an unappetizing manner. What should have been a tasty and warm "I'm sorry you had to fly 8 hours on a stinky plane and deal with lost luggage" comfort food, was instead screaming at me, 

"I've been left out all day! I am not fresh, and worse, I've been MICROWAVED!"

I put the soup aside and picked up my pita. Pita is a stretch. It was not actually on a pita,but rather a flatbread. That would have been fine, but it was also cold. The grilled chicken inside? Also cold.

I ate it anyway as I was hungry and did not feel like complaining. It would have taken another 30 minutes for them to make me another. I am not big on wasting food. Oh right- they could have just nuked it soup- style.
I kept eating until I felt what seemed to be a bone in my mouth. Hmmm. Grilled chicken breast... bone? It was actually part of the burnt skewer that my chicken was cooked on. It was a little longer than an inch- longer than the actual cubes of chicken themselves.

I would have been done then, but our friend wanted to order desert. He wanted the chocolate cake, but it is no longer available. However, we were informed that we can purchase it at a local... bakery? Not quite. I won't mention the place because really, it was a secret anyway. Point being, not cooked on premises. Further point being, not cooked anywhere you would expect to pay $6.50 ish for a slice, whatever the size.

I won't be going back.

disclaimer:
After reading my review of Greekfest, you may think I just don't like Greek food. Quite the contrary. I love Greek food. That's why I am so particular when it comes to my galatabouriko being authentic and my souvlaki being served hot.This place is decent with typical cafe food, sandwiches, burgers, breakfast foods, etc. 

However, I have only been here when I was drunk at 4 am and every single time I am here they take forever to bring the food out. So on top of having very average generic, overpriced food typical of vegas cafes, the service is superslow.

Everytime I came here, trying to recharge by eating so I can start again, the food takes so by the time I finish I am so tired that I end up going back to my room and passing out....I will never know what the food tastes like because they were so so rude, I will not go back.  We came in and were given a table, menus were practically thrown at us.  And then we waited, and waited and waited.  We asked a woman working there, and she apparently did not speak English and indicated a man at the front would help us.  But he was too busy talking.  We got up and left.  No one even said a word when we left.Tried the buffet 6/19/2010 at at 2 p.m. Sunday brunch price about $27.99 per person plus tip.
First do not tip before you have your service, my server thanked us for the tip got us drinks and never came back.
Brunch did not have much in the way of selection.  The produce was under a light, not sure if its a heat lamp but it should have been on ice.  Produce was warm.
Roast beef in lieu of Prime Rib being served.
Portions are paper thin, small than lunch meat, which helped to keep the roast beef extra dry.
Pasta was without flavour.
Person cutting the roast beef was visibly ill, no supervision at the buffet to notice the missing food, or ill server.
Did not try King Crab but tried the limited selection.
The buffet is about 1/4 the size of the Rio or Harahs, or Bellagio but similar priced higher than Rio and Harahs.
Salmon was dry, the pizza was down to four old slices for the 90 minutes we were there, never refreshed.
Maybe its a bad time to show up, or maybe its just a bad buffet.

If anybody has a contact to get a refund please let me know. 
There was no management available and the little food I did try made me feel not so well.  This was especially true after trying the very fishy tasting dry salmon.

Over all I hear the crab legs are ok if that is your thing but other than that, spend less go elsewhere.  Saturday brunch is extremely over priced and is left us feeling like we'd just been ripped off.

Again if you have tips on how to get a refund please post them.Service was terrible. My first time there I ordered a simple bacon cheeseburger and was given a smokehouse bacon burger with bbq sauce and caramelized onions. Disgusting flavor ruined my appetite. Went in for breakfast and didn't want to sit next to a loud group of drunks and was told there was nowhere else I could sit by the power tripping hostess station. Meanwhile, there were literally 100 empty seats. Needless to say, I walked away. Under staffing is unacceptable in a place where you already know you are paying too much for too little. Shame on you Bellagio. Get back into the game!Very disappointing I rather have mcdonalds. 

The food was not good enough to make me want seconds. It wasn't inedible, I ate it with no desire of any kind.

Dessert was sad. The blueberry pie tasted like plastic. My girlfriend had to spit out her little tea cakes. Both of  our desserts were dried.i've heard some great things about this place, and i think once upon a time they were probably true; they definitely aren't now. this place is horrible and it's $50 a person. there's no lobster included, and the seafood isn't as fresh as it should be. the oysters are inedible, and the crab legs are way too salty (probably to cover up the fact that they aren't fresh) on top of everything else, they only serve pepsi products! :( overall, a horrible experience. definitely not what i expected, especially for that price. i highly recommend you avoid this place!!Absolutely. Terrible. 

It took 2 hours to get our food, our server was rude and non-communicative. Apparently the computer system was down and the kitchen was backed up - how that explains a surly server I'll never know. Also, how it explains a luke warm mimosa I don't know either. 

Bleh. Don't waste your time.I am extremely disappointed.  HHAGG use to be my favorite restaurant.  After last night I will never go back!  Not only was the service terrible, but the food was not up to par either.  

The waitress messed up our order by putting in the wrong plate, this after she told my daughter what she ordered was one of her favorites!  Took us about 30 minutes to get the appetizer.  When I saw food going to another party that came in after us(about 15 minutes later), with more people, I asked our waitress why they were getting food before us.  She argued with me that there was no food on or going to that table.  Three times I told her I saw it with my own eyes.  Finally she came back and said it was because we ordered an appetizer.  It was another 10 minutes before our food started coming out.  Once the error was recognized on my daughters plate, it was another 8 or so minutes before hers came out.  

We got there at 7:30 but did not walk out the door until 8:50 pm.  We have had problems in the past with the service and still we returned, but this one takes the cake.  Worst part is that they weren't very busy so you can not use that as an excuse. 

After 7 years of loyalty I will take my business else where!Unhappy.  That will sum it up.  My room (Room 201) was nice enough when I walked in, but upon inspection, I saw it wasn't very clean. For starters, it had not been vacuumed. Sure, there were new linens on the bed, but why were there used sweet and low packets all over the dresser, trash on the floor, and, get this, an empty soap box shoved underneath the bathroom light fixture. 

The hotel is non-smoking, but everyone at the pool was lit up.  A hotel worker did come by to tell them to put their cigarettes out, but once she left they just lit up again. *repeat scenario about six more times*.  I couldn't even enjoy a moment in the hot tub, (which is nice) because some jerk kept throwing trash around it.

This is my final complaint..... no accountability to police what people are doing around the hotel.  Huge groups of douche bag frat boys and sorority princesses pounding drinks and screaming or laughing at the top of their lungs directly in front of other people's hotel rooms from midnight to 6 a.m.  I have no problem with people having a good time, but at 2 a.m., stay the f*** away from in front of my hotel room, especially if your obnoxious laugh sounds like a hyena being raped.  I wanted to strangle the female that kept me up for an hour and a half with her "I have no real personality so I make this sound to seem interesting" laugh.  Luckily my wife called the front desk and filed the complaint.  

My only pluses for this place.  Once the front desk is called with a complaint, they go and try to stop it (too bad this is a reactionary response), key word being try, since it seems they do not really enforce any of their own rules.  Free soda's and junk food.  Free wifi. Yup, that's about it.Don't eat at this place. The gyro came wrapped in a cold cardboard like pita bread. I will say the owners wife was very nice but the owner him self being on his lap top was very off putting. Felt like we were bothering him. I had some fries as well let's say all 10 fries were tasty I'm guessing they were having a potato shortage with just a hand full of fries. This place had a very dirty beverage fridge in the public area. Just not a well put together cafe with very poor food.The walls and the one dolalr bill thing is cool. but when i asked about it they said its a long story and walked away... WHAT? Also i checked in on yelp and got free fries... well was supposed to.. the cashier even marked it as used on my phone then we never got the fries. I order a chicken cheesesteak.. Literally chicken and cheese. Wow even being intoxicated it was bad. My brother also ordered a ROAST beef.. and they have gave him regular beef and cheese.. thats a hell of a difference. This place is literally to sober up at... not enjoy.if you like frozen lower then mediocre costco seafood, standing in line for way over 30 minutes at a time, and think jerry springer guests are celebrities. then this is the place for you!

so many great places in vegas i have no idea why yelpers are giving this place such high reviews.

oyster bar has the worst oysters we have ever had. on a postive note, i give the bloody marys and people watching 5 stars!!Blah! Blah! Blah!  My hubby and I came here with such high expectations after reading/ hearing all the reviews... and boy were we ever disappointed... infact my hubby got kind of quesy after eating here and we returned to our hotel to sleep it off...
Yet another buffet that I will not be coming to in VegasSo disappointed with our dinner & service. Waiter didn't know drink menu & brought wrong drinks but then tried to convince us they were the right ones. Very slow & choppy service. Bad acoustics & couldn't hear people at the table. Worst of all, food was boring and overpriced - one big plate of pasta for the entree.  Very few menu choices. None of us finished our meals.Well, second birthday in as many months and we left without a cake.  We have been loyal customers for years but we have noticed their service/ management has gone down the tubes.  

Last month we went to purchase a cake and they only had 1 in the case (actually a pie) and today we went to order a birthday cake for early next week and we were told that that wasn't going to be possible for the baker was on vacation and the owner was out of town.  The person behind the counter did offer to sell me one of their cakes in the case (not the size or flavor that I wanted ), but I thought maybe I can buy a week old cake somewhere else.  

To be honest, the only reason we keep coming back is that their cakes are so delicious but I am not sure how many bad experiences I have left in me with this place.HIPSTERS!!! meh..no thanks. I do not like this rehashed "punk" electronic stuff so automatically I am pissed about the $5 I spend to get in but say "eff it" because even in my head I keep it censored.  Drinks-overpriced.  Music- uh not so much. Guys- hipsters, creepers, or not into girls. I stayed for one drink with my friend, and we  both got ruffied. yikes. Honestly did not even step away from our drinks for one second or really even look away, skilled hipster creeps. I will NEVER go back there as I am not a fan of being unknowingly drugged.Yeah sorry guys this place is not cool enough to charge a cover even on weekends. I only went in cause a friend insisted it was the place to be, not the case. Expensive watery drinks and so smokey you could hardly breath. Stayed for two drinks then went next store to the piano bar and had a blast there. I guess some people like these little divey arts/trash/hipster scene but just not my thing.Now that I have been forced to eat here twice, I'm compelled to update this review because I feel like unsuspecting out-of-towners could be convinced by people who live in the vegas suburbs but who've never been anywhere else (like, perhaps, the strip) that this is a decent place to eat.

The food here could be compared to a Baja Fresh (except not very fresh) or Olive Garden or slightly more sophisticated TGI Friday, but the atmosphere is desperate suburban cougars at the bar and sloppy men in suits.  Plus you pay 10 times the price of Baja Fresh to eat next to the angriest, saddest people you have ever seen.  And the poor servers are angry, too: I can't think of another reason why they would be so indifferent (at best) and hostile.  The service here is about the worst I've had, anywhere. (Twice now.)  At least at TGI Friday, I imagine the servers care whether you enjoyed your disgusting, chewy calamari.

If you are forced to stay in Summerlin, either eat at In-N-Out or do yourself a favor and take a taxi in to the strip.  (DO NOT eat at your hotel -- but you probably already know that.)This place takes everything that is lame about Scottsdale and wraps it into one neat little package in Phoenix.  I was so excited for a new bar in the hood, but then this showed up.  Bad food, plastic people, crappy music, too sterile.  Pretty poopy.Our server was a horrible, lying bitch, to put it nicely.  'Cause I wanted to like this place, I really did.  She didn't greet us at all; the first thing she said was, "What do you wanna drink?" with a bit of an attitude.  She wouldn't serve us bread until we asked for it since we saw other tables with baskets of bread, but she straight up told us bread was for the people who ordered from the lunch menu.  Then she brought out a measly basket of bread for us and said that was all was left - even though all the other tables had big ass baskets full of all kinds of different bread.

When she took our orders, she didn't ask my father how well he wanted his steak - which we didn't realize until his steak came and it was all bloody on the inside.  I ordered a Strawberry, Raspberry, and Blueberry waffle which was actually surprisingly really good.  I think that was the best part during the meal.

She took 20 minutes in getting our bill and finishing the transaction.  We didn't even know what the hell she was doing.  She kept circling the restaurant, going in and out of the kitchen, looking around, going back into the kitchen, and coming out with nothing.  It was really sad too, 'cause the other server who was taking care of tables nearby us was so attentive and she just failed upon comparison.  I don't remember what else since this happened last month, but just no.  Never again!  Go spend your money elsewhere.

P.S. I just remembered an incident that happened to the table next to us who were also being served by this lazy ass waitress.  Apparently, one of the ladies wanted white bread and the waitress gave her Sourdough.  The lady told her it was Sourdough and instead of just apologizing and bringing her the white bread, the waitress argued with her and insisted it wasn't Sourdough.  All the lady said was, "Uh, this is Sourdough.  Trust me, I ate it."

That party of 4 also didn't finish the majority of their food so I'm assuming what they ordered wasn't that tasty.  They also only left a $2 tip which was hilarious since you know meals like this are pretty expensive in Vegas - and they totally didn't follow the "15% tip rule".  And neither did we.

I wish I remembered the server's name, so you can do all you can do to avoid her, but sadly, I don't =/  All I remember is she's (I think) Hispanic, middle-aged, short, kind of on the large side, with curly brown hair.  I'm sure a lot of people have had great experiences at The Cafe considering the reviews before mine - and the food was pretty good too - but they just really need to get rid of her.nope  over rated-- pretty restaurant  but it should bee it was empty when we went and sat at the sushi bar. had to ask for towels and it  didn't make sense that the chef  placed a paper order ticket on top of the fish  we thought it was a mistake that it just landed there  but every order she threw the ticket on the plate/fish.  we  had a piece and a roll and left  was still $50    save your money 
Go to TAO in the Palazzo/VenetianMy boyfriend took my dog here to get his nails clipped today. We are sometimes too nervous to do the job ourselves, because we want to make sure we don't hit the quick of his nails. I usually love this place and the little baked goods they sell, but after today, I don't think I will bring him here to get grooming anymore at all.

The lady that clipped my dog's nails was super rough with my him and she made my dog's nails bleed really, really bad. My boyfriend, Roberto, described seeing blood everywhere! The lady that did his nails also had a pretty bad attitude about even having to do the job in the first place.

I am very disappointed, because I thought this was a cute place and a little shop that I would like to support, but now, I'm scared to go back. When we took my dog to Petsmart, they cut and grinded his nails for a much smaller price, and they did not hurt him.They have shark's fin soup on the menu. I saw that and got too woogy to eat. The sea is being decimated and there's just no place for this item in modern cuisine.Complete Scam! Booked a reservation 2 months in advance on Booking.com.

Had to cancel the trip 5 days in advance. Wyndham kept my money. Will not issue a refund. I completely fulfilled the requirements of a timely cancellation. Every time I call, they make up new rules on why they will not refund my money. Latest is "they do not accept cancellations over the phone, they have to be in person" for reservations booked through 3rd parties such as Booking.com. This is ridiculous for a vacation resort. Let me just fly on over to come talk to you in person. Absolutely ridiculous. DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS PROPERTY OR DO BUSINESS with Wyndham. It's a complete scam!!!!! They stole $665.00!!!Extremely poor service. Tried to charge us for dinner prices during lunch. Didn't apologize wen we had to point out the error. Pretty restaurant but that's it. Won't return.Terrible service even when place is nearly empty!  Truly awful margaritas, how is this possible at a Mexican restaurant that is as expensive as this one?  This is the most awful restaurant in Las Vegas I have visited, truly awful management!  The last straw was charging me for two when I ordered for one fajitas, they charged me $32 for this one item!  I pointed out to server and she refused to correct bill.  Never will I enter this place again!

Overall: Do yourself a favor - use the MGM Grand's Casino Entrance/Exit, turn right, and take the 3 minute walk to Panda Express.

My fam and I were craving some Chinese food so we went here at the recommendation of my cousin who frequents Vegas and says this is the closest Chinese restaurant and pretty good (we were staying at the MGM anyway)

Wow, was he wrong! First off, I don't eat seafood, so I can't comment on that - which dominates a lot of their menu items.  But here's what we did have

Mongolian Beef - This was the only good dish I sampled. However, this is NOT mongolian beef. They're like mini steaks. It tasted good, like duck actually, and it was very tender. However, it was nowhere near Mongolian beef. I did like the sauce that came with it since it was infused with a slight hint of habanero. But this was not Mongolian beef in the slightest.

"Chow fun" (Beef rice noodle with soy sauce) - they weren't kidding. It was just that. No other real flavorings, just soy sauce. No attempt at making a delicious sauce. Just take some kikoman or something and pour it over noodles, fry it for 5 seconds and serve. Wow. bad.

Combination Fried Rice - What the hell is with all these beans? There was like no meat in my dish. Who does this? Really????

Honey Walnut Shrimp - My cousin's favorite dish. He enjoyed it. I enjoyed the walnut.

Additionally - no free refills on soda. I mean, I'd expect that at a Pho restaurant, but not a crappy expensive Chinese restaurant. (I guess it's not really Chinese, but "Asian Fusion" - Asian fused with crap)

For those that enjoy Chinese food, you know it's about the large, family-sized portions. I didn't expect much of that here, but for the price they make you pay, they surely don't delivery in either quality or quantity.

Overall this place sucks, and it left such a bad memory in my head, that I went to Panda Express the morning after and had a much more satisfying meal for less. Do yourself a favor - use the MGM Grand's Casino Entrance/Exit, turn right, and take the 3 minute walk to Panda Express.Well...these days it is difficult to find anything positive to report about an airline. US Airways delivers nuts and bolts in an average way (meaning the plane works technically and delivers you to your destination for a reasonable price). Mostly on time. 

They could stand out from this averageness, however, if they would not make so many Nickeling and Diming efforts. For example the seat selling techniques applied are just downright counterproductive. When checking in on line, all seats except the pre-assigned center seats (different rows, even though we bought tickets together) were $15. This, of course, to compel you to spend another $30 to sit with The Wife (yes, $30, since there was no purchaseable seat right next to one of the pre-assigned centers....psychology, anyone??). Then, we were almost late at the airport, but still went to the underused check-in counter. We asked if we could sit together. Result: Reclining exit row seats for free in a half-full plane.

Then we proceeded through the half empty airport and found out that we could actually go on a 1hr earlier plane, which was not full. However, the representative at the gate wanted $50 per ticked to make this change...again the Nickel and the Dime! Do they realize how bad this looks? Letting us on would not have cost anything, but would have left us with a happy memory...corporate numb nuts! Anyway, we went for coffee, saved the $100, and went on the booked plane. Can't be Nickeled and Dimed!

More from the US Airways front (6/2011). It appears that they are stepping up their "force people to check bags to collect more revenue" efforts. Sitting at the gate, the loudspeaker blasted something like: "If your bag exceeds the size box and you will not check it right now, but wait until we detect your outsize-baggage-sneaking-in attempts at the gate when boarding, you will be charged for the bag when we check it in"-very nice. Several people immediately ran to the counter and checked their bags (for free). Then, when finally boarding my bag was singled out and put towards the "sizer". It was slightly too thick, and the clerkess immediately blasted: this must be checked...but then she got distracted, and another less-eager clerkess winked at me and indicated me to move on the plane...lucky me!

Bottom line: It ain't getting better in those 'friendly skies'! Fly Southwest if you can!What kind of customer facing company doesn't allow you to speak to a person to complain? Somehow they managed to lose our bag in Chicago when we didn't even change planes there. We didn't even know we had to stop in Chicago until we got on the flight thanks to a very disinterested ticketing agent. And they didn't even offer to pay the $25 fee that we had to pay to get it to our final destination in the first place. You have to send an email and forms for them to even review to credit anything. The only saving grace was an associate that got permission for my boyfriend to buy a jacket since we were in Boston with just a tee shirt. And we still have to send in the receipts and a form to get that back. Overall one of the worst experiences I've ever had.Wolfman Puke!!
Salad was spoiled to deterioration and waiter was overwhelmed. NEVER again!Biggest disappointment in Vegas was paying over $3 each for stale, hard macarons (and I had two different flavors, so it wasn't just one bad batch). The people working there were super friendly, but considering I walked a mile out of my way to try the macarons, I was really disappointed. Maybe I just caught them on a really off day, but these were some seriously bad macarons.My entire family ate lunch here, and we ALL got sick after. So if you like paying money to get food poisoning, then this is the right place. I will NOT be returning to this place. ever.Well, compared to everyone else, I got a great person at the window, she was not only kind and sweet, but she made terrific conversation, never met anyone as nice. However, the hot chocolate was terrible, i mean, bitter, burnt, gross, and completely un-drinkable. How can you mess up hot chocolate? You have to TRY to get that wrong. More over, i asked for without whipped cream and got some anyways, I hate that. There was a particular reason i asked for without, I wouldn't go out  of my without reason. 

Also, this is mainly a get your coffee and go type place, only outdoor seating next to a large intersection. Not recommended for a relaxing place. And my experience doesn't mean all the Batistas are as nice as this one individual. 

Seriously, don't bother with this place though, the one on Mill is far better.Buyer beware! My boyfriend, our two children, and I were supposed to stay in the two story casita for a staycation before school starts again. My opinion was soured right away when we went to check-in at 4pm, an hour past the usual 3pm check-in time at most hotels. The man at check in informed us that the room was not ready yet. I asked him if he could give me a ballpark time of how long the wait would be. He seemed bothered to find out, but called housekeeping and simply told me "soon". AN HOUR LATER we finally got keys to the casita. Scattered about the grounds was random trash, wrappers, and cigarette butts. Then we went in side. Let me just start by saying that casita was described on the website as "Spanish-Mediterranean" decor. Ha! The decor was better described as "ghetto" in my opinion. The first thing my boyfriend noticed was that the refridgerator was being held up by a block of wood. We thought this was strange, until we actually tried opening it and it wobbled. A lot. The refridgerator wasn't a big deal to me; we were there to spend time as a family and use the multiple pools anyway. But then I sat on the couch and the cushions were very wet. And stained. As were the drapes. And the fraying chairs sitting at the breakfast bar (crusty white stains specifically). And if the wet, stained chairs weren't enough, there were flys EVERYWHERE. Not exactly welcome house guests. The carpet however, was the worst. There were multiple spots with tacky black stains that were literally stuck to the floor. The trash can in the kitchen didn't even have a trash liner already in it; instead the bag was draped across the top. My boyfriend and our girls suggested we use the pool, most likely because they could see the steam coming out of my ears. I layed out in one of the many lounge chairs while the rest of the brood tried out the lazy river. I was unable to relax however due to the many wasps that were buzzing around me. Now maybe I expected too much, but I thought at one point a staff member might come over and ask me if I wanted a drink. Of course this never happened. Not that I didn't see any staff; there was a young man sitting on a lounge chair texting on his cellphone, and two others chatting about the plans they had tonight once they got off of work. At this point my boyfriend joined me and said that the lazy river was lame because you had to paddle yourself along. If I remember correctly, a lazy river doesn't require you to do anything. At this point I decided that there was no way we were paying $179 a night (not including resort fees) to stay there and I called the front desk to speak to a manager. The manager, Shawn, asked if we wanted to move to another casita. No. He then told me that he could refund us the full amount and we could check out right away (the only good aspect of the entire debacle). Of this I was grateful, trust me. However, he didn't even ask why our experience was so bad that we wanted to leave. In fact, I asked him if I could tell him what was wrong! And once I told him my laundry list of disappointments, he simply said, "I'm sorry we didn't exceed your expectations." I don't expect any business to exceed my expectations, but I do expect businesses to meet them. Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak did not even come close.This place is HORRIBLE!!!!!!  I work about a hundred yards away and have eaten there twice now.  The first time the place was empy and it took 30 minutes to get our food.  The second time there were people there but still not full and it took an HOUR and FIFTEEN MINUTES for them to bring out burgers, fries, a pork sandwich,and wings!!!!  Nobody came back to apologize or see how we were doing, and then when we did talk to a manager she was a complete BITCH and offered us coupons for a free fountain drink.  This place is a joke unless you have 2 hours to kill for lunch and enjoy mediocre bar food and bitchy bar managers.  They will never see another one of my hard earned dollars and I hope they do not see of any of yours!!!!Friend and I went here to play around for the evening. 
Primary objective: drink
We arrive and find the Seahorse Bar.  We go to the counter to order our first drink.  Johnny takes our order, takes an order from a waitress, then proceeds to knock a beer over in our direction spraying all over me and my friend.  No apology, not even an offer for a napkin.  So I reach for a napkin and the bartender tells me not to worry about the mess, that he will clean it up.  I informed him that he had spilled on us and he still didn't acknowledge this!  He just made our drinks, charged us full price and went on with his day.
Overall I have always enjoyed Caesars but this time they failed me big time.Wow this place has gone down hill. Old smelly rooms. Service is horribleyelp suggested it and it's out of business!! there was a note on the door saying the landlord was taking back the property.I have visited this store many times looking for just the right piece for my loft. When ready to make a purchase, I found a dining table and chair set that I very much liked and thought would fit nicely with my decor. The table was marked at $2,100.00 but the chairs had no price tags. I asked to speak to the owner so as to negotiate a price for the entire set and was asked to wait, as he was on his way in. I waited for 20 minutes, when he finally showed. When I casually asked if the price included the chairs, the "gentleman" literally laughed at me, turned around, and walked away without saying a word. Humiliated, I followed him into the other room and stated that I should assume that it didn't. His very flippant reply to me was, "The chairs cost $800 a piece!"...and proceeded to turn his back on me once again. I had $4,000.00 cash in my pocket that day to make a purchase and he and his business not only lost out that day, but I will never make a purchase from that man if that's the way he's going to treat his customers!iSux!

Ipower is the absolute poorest hosting company that I have ever had the misfortune of using. Still have one or two domains registered through them, but will transfer them away closer to expiring time. 

First of all, their customer service is pointless...the techs they have know less than you do most of the time. When you call, you will be on hold for hours and hours and still not get your issue resolved. 

Their Hosting is sketchy at best. If your site is up, it will load very slow, and move at a snail space no matter how simple your site is. I had a simple 3 page resume site up......it took no less than 45 seconds for the landing page to load. No Flash, No Photos, Very basic static site. 

These people suck. I had too many issues, most of which went unresolved, locked out of my account, slow sites, little to no real support, long azz hold times,  crashing servers, no answers, double credit card charges, among just a few of my bad experiences. 

How about we try to find someone that has ever had a good experience with them?? Because such a person does not exist! :DMy family used to love eating here, but it's gone way downhill. Our last to-go order just wasn't cooked right and was un-appetizing. Not a huge deal, we'll just call 'em and they'll make it right.. right? The number on the receipt was out of service. After my wife finally got ahold of someone, they said they would have a manager call us back. Never happened, guess we will have to do a chargeback now. After reading this place is family owned, it makes me sad to see a once beautiful place serving delicious food lose all passion.Let's be honest here-- We don't get our nails done for the actual polish, its the pampering that matters!
That being said, I got a french tip spa pedicure. My nails came out decent enough though i haven't had them more than a couple a days so i'm not sure about chipping just yet.
It was a weekend afternoon around lunch so of course we had to wait a few minutes, no problem. The color selection isn't that great and the bottles seem a little on the old side but this place isnt exactly expensive. I mentioned i wanted french tips and she still insisted i pick out a color? Strange, but i select the whitest white i could find on the wall. 
We get seated about 15 minutes later, put our feet into the water, great temperature but our "massage" chairs do not turn on/vibrate/move at all! well, that's weird but i guess not the end of the world. She sits down in front of me to turn on the jets and spends about 3-5 minutes turning it on to no avail! She simply gave up and instructed me to soak my feet. There were at least 4 other chairs open and when i asked if it didn't work she just said, "no" and proceded to prep the area. 
I thought she would maybe try to make up for the lack of massage chair and whirlpool jets with a decent leg massage but NO. Basically applied lotion and didnt even scrub my heels with any pressure. I will need to go home and do it myself after the shower. 
THIS PLACE WAS TERRIBLE!!
Total came out to $29 (regular price) without tip and with NO apology for the broken amenities. 

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!Don't, don't, don't, I repeat DO NOT STAY HERE! 
I reserved a room with two beds and because I was a late check in (10:30PM) they double sold my room. This is after I gave them a $200 non-refundable deposit. I had to accept a room with one bed. The desk clerk was extremely rude and accusatory. The air conditioner was obnoxiously LOUD. The photos make it look like a nice, upscale hotel worthy of it's 3 1/2 star rating, but this is nothing but a runned down motel with lipstick on it!! ALL THIS FOR $200/NIGHT - Buyer beware!!Unbelievable!!! We order my mom, which is dying of cancer some "edible arrangements" for Valentines day, hoping it would bring a smile to her face! All day long we tracked the order and it said "in transit" the day came and went and my moms arrangement never showed up!!! Almost $60 bucks down the drain! We told my mom something was coming the day before, so she was excited, only nothing ever came!! And on top of it all, NOT EVEN A PHONE CALL letting us know that they were not going to be able to fulfill the order, at least if they had let us know we could have gotten her some flowers or something to replace it. THANKS "EDIBLE ARRANGEMENTS", thanks a lot for let my mom down!!!!!!!!  I'm not even mad about it, In fact I'm very sadden by it......I had a wonderful shopping experience until it was time to claim what i already paid for. A lady named Dianne Reed attended to me. I had a problem with the quality and she reacted coldly, callously and totally uncaring. If you are to shop from Lens Crafters just make sure you are attended to by someone other than this lady.Just my personal opinion. She also quoted me outrageously high prices ( zero discount) whereas when i went on another day, i talked to two other sales ladies and they immediately offered to give me a discount. 
Lens Crafters must be made aware of people like Dianne Reed who totally ruins the shopping experience of people like me.First of all, it is NOT an authentic Chinese food. (Think Panda Express)

We all ordered different items: mostly stir fried noodles. Despite the different names, they ALL tasted very similar. Mind you, if they were good, I wouldn't mind. But they were not flavorful at all, but very salty (Read: MSG / Hypertension). We had to ask a variety of sauces and even then the dishes turned out horrible. Not to brag, but I can definitely stir fry better noodles with fresher ingredients and better sauce mix at home. Coming from California and having tried hundreds of Chinese restaurants in that state, authentic or non-authentic, this restaurant is byfar the worst Chinese restaurant! Congrats on the Golden Raspberry Award.

In terms of decor, it is dimly lit, clean and modern, even fancy. Normally, I would save 2 stars for a restaurant regardless of their taste, but this restaurant is just beyond help - they desperately need to change their recipe or hire a new chef!

To be fair, other Chinese restaurants around the area are of similar quality, but slightly better. If overall it is an Arizonian thing, I would not know.Don Rafa has closed due to economic reasons.  :(I went to this nail place for the first time today because someone bought me a gift card there. The location was good & the salon looked fair clean (although a bit run down) but the staff was not friendly & did a lazy job. I went for a pedicure &  tech was so annoyed at how short I had cut my toenails. Then when I wanted a bright pink french pedicure, she didn't wait at all to apply the top coat & blurred the pink over the white, not to mention the didn't mention the $5 up charge for the (sloppy) french pedicure. Also, my feet feel scratchier than they did before. I did not enjoy this experience & will not be returning.God only knows how a company can hire such incompetent and disorganized employees.   Does Nationwide provide any training in customer service at all????   

I just don't get it.  With so many thousands of bright people looking for work, how does a national company end up with such terrible employees?

I mean, how difficult is it to do an accurate eye exam and send it to the lab to get processed?   (Based on my experience here, it must be about as difficult as flying to Jupiter, as they can't seem to get ANYTHING right.)

I've had five experiences with this Nationwide branch (eye exam, 2 types of glasses), and each one has resulted in major errors resulting in delays in receiving glasses.   The employees don't listen, don't write things down, don't follow up, and worst of all they act like they are doing you a favor by even being there.Went to KFC for a late dinner with the family last night and even though the sign says the lobby closes at 9pm, they had most of the lobby blocked off with chairs so no one would sit where they cleaned already. There were only 4 booths open. We waited forever to get our food and when we did get it, it was horrible!  I am pretty sure they just gave us all the left overs.  The hush puppies were as hard as a rock! The piece of chicken in my sandwich was so small and old it was embarrassing! It was served cold too.  There were 5 of us and we all had old bottom of the barrel food.  The coleslaw dish was half empty.  This is the worst KFC I have ever eaten at.  The bathrooms were filthy too. It's a health hazard to eat there.Absolutely the worst experience ever. Not only was my burger made wrong, I mean it was extremely difficult - mayo, mustard, pickles, lettuce tomato and cheese. what did I get? Ketchup, 3 lousy pickles, a smidge of mustard and lettuce and tomato. The burger was also cold. And I don't mean warm, it was cold. Disgusting. I will never be back to this Carl's Jr. Maybe not to any of them.I was in search of a particular rc plane that can only be found at Target within the store. It is not available online. I searched locations to find the remote control plane and drove to this location. Although, the online directory assured it was in stock at this store, I found it was not. I went to guest services to supply the DPC# and the clerk said there was definitely two in stock. When he called the clerk in electronics she confirmed it but would not bring the item to me. I was asked to walk back to the department that I had already searched to pick up the item. When I got there it was the same selection I had already viewed and was not the Jet Set 2 that I was looking for. The clerk informed me that it matched the DPC# that I brought in. I am very frustrated as this is the second store that I have gone to and was only referred to go to another store in Tempe! Too much running around and no definite answers! Feels like false advertisement to post an item only to find they do not carry it! My son will be very disappointed!The Place is closed. Too bad - Although it is a monster chain restaurant - it was a nice chain.This is terrible food. I've had some not so great Chinese food before, but this place is by far the worst. It doesn't help to call it "asian" to avoid authenticity complaints. It's just bad. The beef must have been soaking in soy sauce for a week. I love salty food, but I developed hypertension after eating here. The sweet sauce in the "General Chi" style (whatever that is) was entirely too sweet to pass for anything. The beef was very tough and completely overcooked. The Orange chicken was the only mildly redeeming dish because I could eat more than a few bites without being overwhelmed with salt or sugar. I don't mean to overstated this: it was the worst meal I've had in Phoenix.WARNING WARNING!!! 
I took my two boys 8 and 10 to the track on 12/26/2011.  I purchase 2 races for each of them.  This was the first time my boys have been to speed street and were a little nervous about driving the cars but I assured them they would be ok.  I signed them up for the junior race and the first race the boys did great.   Both the 8 and 10 year old had a lot of fun, the cars worked, and they came off the track excited!  The second heat went great until my 10 year old's car had the gas pedal stick at full throttle.  He literally jumped one barrier that sent him into the other lane.  The throttle continued to be stuck and the cart slammed into a double barrier.  He bounced off the double barrier and with the throttle still stuck he was heading the opposite direction of traffic.  He jumped a single barrier where the car finally quit.  Fortunately there were no other cars on the portion of the track where he was going in the opposite direction.  3 workers ran out to help my son I also ran out there.  When I reached my son he was completely panicked.  He was terrified and didn't understand why the car kept going when he wasn't pushing the pedals.  I consoled my son for the next 15-20 minutes.  Other people who witnessed the event offered their condolences.  One witness said his cart also had a gas pedal stick.  Not one speed street staffer came up and asked if they could help.  Nobody seemed concerned.

I decided I would go talk with someone about the car.  I first spoke with the mechanic who after realizing I was just looking for an apology and reassurance they would look into the problem was nice and sincere.  I then tracked down the owner (Tex) and began to explain what had happened.  He didn't ask if my son was ok, he didn't try to apologize.  He said this is why you sign a waiver, cars have problems like this all the time, there was nothing he could do, and said I shouldn't have come to speed street.  At that point I told him to quit being an a hole.  He then said he was going to kick me out of the building.  As we walked toward the front of the building I told him I was just looking for an apology and to make sure this type of thing wouldn't happen again so that other people wouldn't be hurt.   He told me to get out because I was trespassing.   I told him I wasn't trespassing and he hollered to one of his staff to call the police.  I told him to go ahead and call the police.   The owner then walked back behind the counter.  I left not wanting to cause a scene, but could not believe the owners ignorance.  I will never again go to speed street.  Please beware of faulty gas pedals and warn your children.What a terrible place. My so called "trainer" could barely speak full sentences let alone english.  He kept pushing pills on me and was very distracted by all of his "gym rat friends".  He was not attentive. 

As for the "membership" I could not change it to a normal one, which is not what the manage told me when I signed up with him.  I have called numerous times to speak with him and he will not get on the phone or return the messages I have left.  His receptionist staff have no clue what they are talking about and are very sketchy over the phone, it's ridiculous.  The girl could not tell me they were going to try and charge me a fee to cancel ( I have had it) because supposedly everyone's plans are different.  

Do not go here. So scammy and sketchy. 
Dirty equipment as well...If I could give them zero stars I would.. I went in on 2 occasions and paid my 35 dollar copay up front and here I am 4 months later receiving a bills from collections! I called asking about it and they were like well oh well sorry we don't see that in our records! Are you serious? You sent it to collections when I paid each time I went!! I always pay my bills on time and thank you for your wonderful company to hurt my credit. Please whatever you do don't go here because one day you might get the same notice in the mail as i did.Moooo.  Like cattle, we line up to go through the line and get on the plane.  In the past, there was mauling and gnashing of teeth to see who could be at the front of the 'A' line, and then a senior citizen or parent with 4 kids would snag the exit row because they were allowed to pre-board (even though legally they're not supposed to sit in the exit row if they're so old that they need extra time to get a seat, or if a parent watching kids).  My only consolation is seeing how irate the families get now that their precious "family boarding" is after the 'A' group, making them have to push and shove with the rest of us, and fight to the death for precious overhead space.

We don't have a fist-fight at the front of the 'A' line any longer.  Instead, there are a bunch of pathetic people who sit in front of their computer and wait until exactly 24 hours before the flight to log on and claim their 'A' boarding pass.  What is amusing is that I tried this once, at exactly the 24 hour limit, and yet I'm somehow #33 in the 'A' group.  Way to go Southwest - eliminate once crazy line and create another.

Stewards and Stewardesses are dressed casual, make jokes that are marginally funny at best, and have ruined air travel for the rest of us on other airlines because so many people are accustomed to behaving and dressing however they want on a flight.  Oh God, bring back the days when air travel was a luxury, and the bus people took the bus (or Amtrak, for that matter).  

Southwest is truly the Wal-Mart of airlines, and has impacted the air travel industry negatively for who knows how long.I rented a car from the Enterprise in Scottsdale Arizona on Scottsdale Road between McDowell and Oak St.  We rented it on a Saturday morning 3/15/14, then returned it Sunday evening 3/16/14 around 7:00 P.M. and left the keys in the lock box.

I received a call around 5:20 today 3/25/14, from an employee at Enterprise asking when I would be returning the car!!!!  Of course I was very alarmed.  She said her manager said a police report would need to be filed and that the car was essentially my responsibility since they never received the car back or the keys.  I was flabbergasted.  I told her I would contact my sister who was also registered to drive the vehicle, and she is who had returned the car that evening.  I confirmed with my sister that indeed it was returned to the same Enterprise and that the keys had been deposited in the lock box.  I called the enterprise employee back and told her, she again said they had no record of it being returned and that I was responsible.  I asked to speak to the manager, she said not to get an attitude with her.  I was upset, but didn't think I needed an attitude check from her as I was just adamantly requesting to speak to the manager.  The manager got on the phone and said that the car had not been returned and the keys had not been deposited and that I would be responsible for any extra days that the car was not at Enterprise and still signed out to me!!!  I asked why they were just now calling me, 9 days after we had returned it, and 9 days after it was scheduled to be returned.  He mentioned paperwork issues.  He said I would need to file a stolen car report with the police.  I said I didn't even remember what kind of car or the color???  He told me the make and color.  I told him I would call the police and hung up.  He called me back at 5:40 and said they found the car at the dealership.  It had been turned in by us, but the next morning they noted the check engine light was on, so it went to the dealership.  He said he would only charge me for the scheduled use of the car.  I said you should not charge me at all after what you just put me through!!  I cant remember the last time I was that blown away, upset and scared!!!  It was a very, very alarming and upsetting experience.

I thought you should know the type of experience I had, and who knows who else has had at this business.  

Enterprise does not have a complaint department that I could locate, so I guess this is it! 

Linda L.Ive honestly had it with this gym. It is honestly the worst LA Fitness I have ever been too and it is in one of the nicest areas of Phoenix/Scottsdale. They said they got "new machines and equipment" but I dont know if they bought them from a garage sale and added them in because everything is awful and so out dated. The weights are always all over the place and even though the trainers have designated weights for themselves in their "special" corner they tend to steal all the weights from the rack. There are dirty paper towels every where and theres no one going around to pick them up. Whoever put the mirrors in the building was an idiot because they are so incorrectly placed that majority of the time you cannot see yourself. Ive gone there 5 times a week for a year, and the staff half the time says hi to me or their too busy conversing with each other or eating. I do not know who the main manager is, you would think since Ive been going there so long, they would have the decency to know their members. I've tried a few of their yoga classes and they were so bad that half the class left 30 minutes into it. One class I went too the whole time we were doing warrior poses and that was it... I know gym yoga isnt the best but this was just flat out awful. Ive started to drive out of my way to the McCormick Ranch LA Fitness and the 7th Street/Moon Valley LA fitness because this is so bad. The reason that Ive had it with this gym though is this morning I went to go workout.. and whoever was supposed to show up at 7AM to open the gym, never showed up. It was 7:45AM when I got there and there was about 50 people waiting outside saying that this is the 3rd time this has happened. 

PS the trainers are awful I always see them staring off or just blabbing along while their clients are in the worst form about to pop out a knee or shoulder.. Safe. Also I had friends asking for a female trainer, they were told there were none and female trainers look like guys anyway so why should it matter that they don't have any.. Yeah made them feel good when they wanted to sign up and pay for PT.

I worked at Gold's Gym in Scottsdale when I was younger, I know how a gym is supposed to work and the issues they run into. Gold's Gym Scottsdale is not a good gym but this makes it look amazing. I also agree with Jack N. the members that go to this gym most of the time should be given a discount. I have my ACE Advanced Healthy and Fitness Specialist Certification and my BS in Nutrition. I work full time as a Nutrition and Weight Management Health Coach and believe I have the right to say all of this. 

Someone needs to knock down this LA Fitness and fire everyone involved and start from scratch.Salon of Arrogance ZERO STARS

 In May of 2013 I made an appointment with Lane. I arrived for my appointment to the place dark and locked with no one in sight. No one called to say they would not be there and/or to reschedule the appointment. I had rearranged my whole day just for that appointment that was set for 1:30PM. I drove from south Chandler to the location on Val Vista. The next day Lane did call my house number to say to call back and lets get me in. I called back and from there all fell silent. No one return the call to set up another appointment. Over the months I thought that the next time I was in that area I was going to make a point of stopping in to A) see if the place was still in business and B) if Lane was there to eyeball the type of individual that is in the service industry that would have no respect for a potential customer that was willing to give them business. That day happened this past Friday. I was in the area and made a point of stopping in to have a look see. Lane was there in all his arrogant glory. When I told him that I just wanted to eye-ball the individual I had an appointment with that not only did not call to let me know that he was not going to make the appointment he could not even be bothered to show up for the appointment he quite smugly smiled and just said "Sorry" and went on about with his client in the chair. As I was leaving the one man and a chair hole in the wall business they obviously found this situation to be quite humorous for I heard laughing. This salon is obviously a self-absorb arrogant unprofessional business. If this fits your style you will feel right at home.DON'T do it. These folks will overcharge you. Listen to me, listen to these other reviewers. They just charged me $212 to pop the lock on my car. After quoting me $40 on the phone.

This is how I KNOW they are SCAMMERS: I locked keys in this SAME car in Pennsylvania last year. Locksmith charged us... $45. That's right. I get to Arizona, and these guys tell me I have a "high security car." WHAT?

Craziness. I feel robbed. The only redeeming factor was the fact that the technician was really nice. But that's not going to help me recoup the $212 I just WASTED on this scam deal of a locksmith job.If I could give no stars I would!! The customer service in the pharmacy here is horrible. The give time estimates them tell you to come back two hours later when you show up at the time they originally quoted you! The staff is rude and not empathetic towards their fellow human beings. Not to mention their new policy not allowing me to use a discount card because I don't have insurance (even though I have been using it for months! My rx is normally $280 and the discount card brings it down to $130... I fill my rx every month... It's very expensive even with the discount card.. But still doable). Oh, and they won't be accommodating and take a family member credit card information over the phone who is out of state.. Even if the person goes to another cvs!We came to South Point to see the Spazmatics. While eating in the buffet before the show, I began to notice that there was a stronger smoke smell than I had experienced at more prominent casinos. After dinner, we wandered the gaming area and got in line for the show. That's when I became overwhelmed by the smoking. Jesus!  I guess they decided to cut a corner with air scrubbers, because within 20 minutes, I was sneezing and had an uncontrollable flow of sinus drainage. My best advice is to stay away from this place if you do not smoke. Consider yourself warned. Oh, the Spazmatics were great.Worst McDonald's I have ever been to! 

The area is bad but the employees are just as bad no customer service and just do not care about the customers just themselves and their jokes even the manager acts like a teenager talking about parties and using bad language in front of my child. The food was also not fresh I stopped there since its the closest to my work but I will drive an extra mile and go to the one on Sunset and Eastern WAY more professional and fresh!! Who ever owns this McDonald's has no clue on the behavior of their employees!I keep trying this place once a year and I never learn my lesson. Not good Italian food. Just go for a sandwich or burger. Tonight on 10/7/13 our server was poor. Prices have gone up too. Why???  Again just go for a sandwich.I had a very bad experience with the store.  Very rude seamstress. She cost the company she works for money because my husband and I will never go there again.  If you are looking for a friendly family business, do not go to Boston cleaners on West Charleston they are expensive, rude and unfriendly.Took our son to this Snips & Clips on Grand Canyon. The black lady who cut our 14-month-old son's hair was very nice, but she did an awful job cutting it. She cut too high over the ears. Some strands were much longer than others, and the back was uneven. We will never be going to Snips & Clips again.My wife and I have been anxious to try this place since seeing it on Restaurant Impossible, especially since it's pretty close to an area we frequent.  The parking lot is a total cluster.  The outside of the establishment is ho-hum.  The interior is just as I remembered it from RI, but nothing spectacular.  Upon entering we were immediately greeted and told we could take a seat wherever we liked.  Unfortunately, the hostess wasn't the only thing that greeted us.  We were immediately hit with an incredibly foul odor.  I thought perhaps it was some kind of chemical smell.  My wife was sure it was more like a damp, mildew/mold funk.  Either way it was pretty overwhelming.  We were given some menus which, despite the sign outside indicating "Breakfast and Lunch", only seemed to contain breakfast items.  As it was already after noon and we were seeking lunch, we asked for, and received, lunch menus.  Nothing on the menu seemed spectacular to me.  During this time a young lady (I think her name was Bree) had already taken our drink order, continuing with what appeared to be pretty decent service.  By the time our drinks arrived we seriously hated the stench which filled the entire establishment.  There were two or three other tables filled with customers.  I assume they had all been in a combat environment which rendered them unable to smell; otherwise I can't imagine how they had consumed a meal in this joint.  Upon a bit of further discussion regarding the retched smell, we decided to leave a few bucks on the table to cover the iced tea, and bail out.  We did just that.  The smell was so bad we couldn't even stay to try to the food.  Never again.  This one is off the list.  I had high hopes, but this place didn't live up to the "smell test".well i have to say i gave this place 2 shots and i will never teturn a third time.  The store on windmill is usually dirty and when eating in with another person you get your food at different times.  nothing like eating with a friend with nothing in front of them.  Then go to their website and try and find hours of operation......NONE.... When i called to find out i was so surprised nobody answered the phone and the voice mail box was full...never again...  Oh and BTW the tarter sauce is the worst i was even willing to stop and get some at smiths.Worst Korean food ever. Normally when we get soft tofu it comes out boiling but not here. It was just luke warm. There were only a few side dishes. But the table next to us (a few Koreans) had way more side dishes. 

Maybe if you are Korean you will get better food and service. Place sucks. Never going back. My family got sick after eating the soft tofu. It's just gross. No flavor in the soup. 

Ruined our night.I'm only giving this 1 star because I cannot give it negative 10. From the moment we met with the first Showtime tours staff we were instantly put off, talked down to, and belittled.  The man at the booth barked at us to move down to another booth to get our shuttle bus vouchers printed.  Then we waited in a short line of about three people that should have only taken minutes, but instead took nearly an hour. It was not without incident though as Tammy screamed at the patrons to move behind the line. When we finally made it to the window to be "greeted" by none other than the angelic Tammy. We were pretty proud of ourselves for having our email with our travel itinerary pulled up to show Tammy just like the instructions said. Tammy was not as delighted as we were. Tammy balled at us for not printing it out. Tammy handed us a scrappy business card and told us to forward the email to her. Well the email was incredibly long with uppercase lowercase letters special characters and numbers. We managed to send it four times ,but not quick enough for Tammy who told us to step aside but not to the empty space to the right but back to the left in the sea of people. After Tammy finished arguing with the lady behind us for not printing out her travel vouchers, she came out to give us our print out. Then the line for the shuttle bus. This is where we met the even more pleasant Joelito, the driver. He too like to yell at patrons and scold them for not having paperwork in 2014.  I think we would have been more comfortable hitchhiking with a family of clowns in a tiny car. Take a cab you'll thank me.I have been ripped off here too many times.  And it seems everytime I go someone else is getting ripped off as well.

1st, I bought 4 tires and was supposed to get $300 of free gas(promo).  Never got any gas and the ownership just shrugged their shoulders and said they were considering stopping the promotion cause they got so many complaints.  He then gave me a number to call, and they couldn't help me either. 

2nd,  They check air pressure for free, but when the tech broke the hub cap while taking it off, it was MY problem.

3rd, I got an alignment done $80 and the report they gave me showed that tires were still off centered, border lining on the unaccepatable range , the tech was unable to explain what the numbers meant but said that was usually as close as they can get, and the car still pulls the same way it did before I took it in.

Why does this shop have to be so close to my house?  Do not take your car here, whatever you do.I work at hospital across from Kopper Keg , I will never go back to this bar . Horrible service , Drinks are not mix well , and the bartender , "big fat guy, with a white hat "  at night , is so rude and unprofessional .Me and co - workers will never go back . I hope they don't delete our review because this bar is Horrible .This place was the worst of worst never have I tasted such gross food, found a hair in my food, vegetable rolls were just so nasty . We ended up throwing away 98. % of the food. This place needs closed down.ok  it is a great view of the city.. but we came here for a big private party.. and after last call and the lights came on and the security instantly started to yell and make everyone go to the elevators.  he was extremely RUDE.

im not a drink so i was sober so my view was not from the drunken eye... there was no need for him to yell at everyone to get us out. i understand that it is closing time and people need to leave... but when someone comes in and spends a lot of money at your place give them a moment to walk out the door before you go hooting and hollering!I would of gave it more stars the reason why is because they should of stayed open later than 8:00pm!! Why not 9pm or 10pm?? They are making money why not stay open much later!!A couple years ago I almost rented an apartment here but was shocked by how they mistreated me and stole my money.

This was a classic bait and switch in my book.  I was shown a great looking apartment with vaulted ceilings and high windows that I thought was great.  I selected options with their employee, put down my deposit and waited for the move in date.

When it came time to get the keys the apartment was nothing like what I had asked for.  It turned out that several of the options I had selected with their assistance were in fact mutually exclusive.  So they just picked one and assumed that would be fine?! (High windows and a garage were the options. But lots of little differences that made the place look dark and oddly designed.)

Obviously I wasn't willing accept the apartment because my agreement to the premium price was predicated on getting all the things I wanted.  I explained how I felt: that somebody at some point before taking my money should have said "Oh, I'm sorry, but that apartment we were selling you on doesn't actually exist."

They were very rude and refused to refund me the money I put down on their fiction.

Down with Ovation!If I could give less than one star I would. DON'T rent here! Management and staff are not professional and very rude, and when I called with some legitimate issues they did nothing to make them right. The manager talked over me the whole time and when I got mad he hung up on me. That's just the start of it. Our unit has some hokey set up with the AC run off for the condensation that drips from the ceiling into our sink! Very unsanitary! Just save your money and go elsewhere.Oh, yuk.

Ten years ago, this place used to at least be tolerable, but any more I can't drive past it without sneering and saying, 'oh, yuk.'

The meat is low grade, no matter what kind.  The chicken is fatty, the beef is tough.  Anything fried tastes like oil and not like the food it's supposed to be.  Their sauces are so thick they're more like glazes, and the sugary ones will almost send you into a diabetic coma.  The rice isn't cooked correctly and even the fortune cookie I got last time was stale.

Add to the fact that the people working there are usually not very accommodating or friendly and that the place is filthy, and there's not a thing in the world that would take me back here.This place is far the worst place to get your nails done.  It burned my nail while he was filing it down.  Usually my fills are smooth but when you rub over the nail its bumpy as hell.  I RECOMMENED neverrr go to this place.  This place sucksOn the road again, I am going on the road again to another storage facility on Sunset and Sandhill.  My friends locker getting robbed 3x is 3x to many.  There are no security cameras and it is easy to just walk in following someone else in and zap there goes your stuff.  My locker has not had this problem but then I have a tiny one. I am not waiting to be robbed.  There have been numerous robbery reports... nothing police can do,,,, and how many times do you think the insurance company will pay.This is the worst hotel in Las Vegas.  The cost is over priced, the rooms are very old school and the staff is not accommodating.  My boy friend got injured from the stupid revolving door and he got a black eye and was bleeding.  They didn't even cover any medical costs and just provided ice packs.. Shouldnt they have at least comped our stay or given us a free nights stay for next time.  Even if they did provide me with a free night i probably would have not came back but at least I would not be on Yelp right now giving them this horrible review!  The T.V's in the mirrors are pointless.  There is really nothing to do at this hotel... NEVER going back.This was our second time staying at trump. The hotel is cheap, close to the strip and clean. I did order room service for one breakfast since there was no space in the dinning area. The food was disgusting. The other days I went out. You could hear the train the entire time. It is annoying when you are trying to sleep and the train passes. Also we got an item that we purchased taken from our room which they kept saying oh we can't say for sure if someone took it. It was missing after the house keeping left. Also I asked them to change the sheets on the bed but they never changed them. I won't be staying there anymore. They also charge a 25 dollars resort fee per day which can add up if you are staying several nights.Hmmmm this is truely a dive bar. I go here w/my friend the days Sweaty is playing. I usually have no problem,  until this holiday weekend. The funny part in this ordeal is, I wasn't drinking.
I bought a pitcher of beer, gave a tall blond pretty waitress my debit card to charge it. Simple right?  She came around a few more times 2 check on my friends n I n asked her 2 cash me out. So me being tired n assuming that I had gotten my card back. 
Something told me to check my wallet in the am, that's when I realized I didn't have my card. I called the bar n was told the cards are locked in the office n I would have to ho by after 6pm 2 get it. I did go - no card. I was told 2 leave my info (contact) n theu would call me if they found it. 2nd call = no card n told 2 call back at noon. 
Checked my bank account n find out I have been charged $25 4 a pitcher of beer n a card they can't find! So finally after a week n going to the bank 2 get a temporary n new card - the bar still couldn't find it. 
Not 2 self.... when coming here pay cash no cards!!!!!First and last time I'll stay at Planet Hollywood.

Stayed here with about 10 other girls for MDW. Since I never stayed at PH before, I always liked them solely for having Earl's and Fat Tuesdays. After MDW, I now know that's all they're good for. In short, poor customer service and very unhelpful.

First off, we booked PH for a two bed room, but we ended up getting one king size bed. Annoying, but they did say they couldn't guarantee requests. Fine. On a quick random note, apparently all the rooms at PH have a different movie theme - ours was the Karate Kid.

Our first issue with PH was that their rooms have the shittiest lighting ever. This is NOT ideal for girls that have to get ready to go out clubbing. Not only is the lighting not bright enough, but they just didn't have any lamps in the room! Even the desk didn't have a lamp, which we thought was strange.

Our second night was a complete disaster. My friends and I were about ready to leave our room to go out clubbing when one of my friends informed us that the toilet was clogged and started to overflow, leaking onto the bathroom floor. We quickly called the front desk to notify them about the problem and they said they would fix it (this was around 9pm). We also made sure that it was okay that we were stepping out for the night and they assured us it was fine and they would fix it while we were out.

A friend and I ended up coming back early because she wasn't feeling well, so it was around 12:30-45 when we reached our floor and were walking to our room. As we got closer, we saw a cart outside of our room. A worker came out and said, "Are you staying in here? Your toilet overflowed and started to leak to the floor below. We need to move all of your stuff to a new room." What. The. Fuck. We went into our room and saw that the carpet was SOAKED with water that probably had remnants of pee, poo, and vomit. Since a lot of us had left our stuff on the floor, our bags and clothes were soaked, too. EWWW.

So, we had to move everything out and to our new room. Luckily, we had a bell hop help us, so that was nice of them since it was only 2 of us moving 10 girls-worth of luggage. When a few more of our friends came back, including the one whose credit card was under the room, she went down to go talk to the manager about the situation - making sure we didn't have to pay for the water damages. She came back up, pissed, telling us that the staff was very unhelpful and basically told her that they wouldn't do anything for us because they're already doing us a favor by not charging us for the damages. Well obviously we shouldn't be charged because it was not our fault. We did our duty as customers to inform them of a problem. Oh, I forgot to mention that when my friend and I first arrived at 12:45 that it looked as if they had just started to clean up the water, when we called them about it at 9pm. If they had tended to the problem immediately at 9pm, then there probably would only be water leakage on the bathroom tile floor, which is a million times easier to dry than carpet. Why they didn't tend to it sooner is beyond me, but regardless, we informed them so it is not our fault. Still,they would not do anything for us since clearly they see that they are doing something for us by not charging us for their fuck up.

This whole situation really showed us their lack of integrity and they must not care that we're telling all of our friends (and fellow Yelpers) not to stay there. Aside from our whole toilet situation, I still don't like this hotel for its poor lighting in the rooms and their house keeping is pretty shitty, too. We requested to have more towels and blankets the first night and all we got was one towel and a pile of bed sheets.

Thanks, PH.Rooms look beat up. Toilette handle stuck. We requested no fragrance when making our reservation.  We checked in, went to our room and found that it HAD been sprayed with VERY PUNGENT FRAGRANCE. We asked for the manager who denied that they use fragrance on property at all.  Which is a lie. They charged us $100 for the night plus the $20 resort fee. We never even stayed in the room nor took our luggage up. I will never shop in the Miracle Mile shops or go to PH again.If this is the one in the Phoenix Center, I would like to say that while the food was good and the atmosphere great (my first time going to the center) we were stuck with perhaps the worst waitress there. Though she was more than happy take our order for appetizers and drinks... once we said we are not sure about eatting dinner yet... she promptly took order and not until almost an hour later, brought our bill only because I asked th hostess. We watched as she chatted with other tables and visited them often, we were ignored. I had to ask the hostess for the waters that were to be brought to us and eventually the check.  The manager came over as my guest had to ask him for more pitas. Overall for not even a busy night, her service was deplorable. I would NOT be going back there but rather the Scottsdale and Tempe offices are a much better choice and awesome service.   Goes to show one, don't mention you want appetizers and drinks and will decide on dinner later... you will get substandard service. For what could have been a few extra drinks, dinner and desserts and a hefty tip for the waitress...we left having only one drink each and shared two appetizers... the hostess who was awesome got the good tip. Only wishes I would have gotten the name of the bad one. :)My husband and I came after the D-backs came.  It was expensive and had a limited menu.  Food was ok, but how hard is it for a sports bar to have good wings.  Our waitress was kind of rude, when we commented on the limited menu she told us that we were free to go to TGI Friday's.  We will definitely remember to try that next time.Now normally I would not give a whataburger this low of a rating. But back in Dec on a vacation I came back from a bar late on a Sunday night went to this whataburger and they had no meat! We went to the drive up menu where greeted. Told them it would be a minute. We took ten minutes and finally when we decided what we wanted we where THEN told they where out of meat. Sigh.Food was decent.. 1 star.

Service was HORRENDOUS. Hannah was our server. She got us everything we needed, refills were pretty on point, she checked up on us frequently...
BUUUUT-- they have an automatic 18% gratuity charge for parties of 6+. We were a table of 5, yet Hannah still charged us the 18% gratuity. When she was confronted, she kind of stuttered and turned red. She really had no excuse.. All she said was, "oh well at first I thought there were 6 of you guys." Weeelllll... We're asking you about it now, why don't you reverse it(?) Clearly there were only 5 adults. I think this is her way of assuring her tips. I know it's Vegas and there's a bunch of drunkies who don't check their bill... But we're a family here for breakfast. Does this girl really think she can fool us???? Any whom, our restaurant experience was okay overall. Hannah should really rethink who she's about to rip off next.

EVERYONE READ THE FINE PRINT!!!! DON'T BE RIPPED OFF!!!!One star because they got 86 dollars from my credit card for a 36 dollars diner. I just ordered three thicken sandwiches and cup of juice. I clearly remembered that the bill I signed was about 36 dollars.  I don't know how did they do this. 
What's more, it was the first time that I payed for a cup of hot water in the restaurant...I took my parents here today, none of us had ever been.  The food was terrible, they skimp on all their ingredients.  I ordered the killer Cajun omelette, there was the portions of the food were extremely small, and all the ingredients in the omlette were all on one side of the omlette.  As my father was paying the bill the hostess asked how our meals were, and my dad told her...not very good.  This girl said nothing after!!  Nothing!  If you want below average food and service....this is your place!  If you are looking for a good breakfast then there are many better places in the valley.I really hate to give this place such a terrible rating because the food itself was delicious.  However, the service was absolutely atrocious.  My husband and I waited fifteen minutes to be seated while two other tables who came up after we arrived were seated immediately.  It then took an additional ten minutes to be addressed by the waiter.  Dinner took 30 minutes to arrive and part of my husband's order was missing.  The check took another extended period of time.  All in all we spent well over an hour and a half waiting and very little actually enjoying our meal.  Very disappointed.Horrible valentine dinner!!  Took my daughter to Armitage and ordered the Valentine special for two!  A cheap cold fish plate and a cold fatty strip steak. Sent them both back. My daughter said they were too cold  to eat. They finally served them hot. Said they were having a BAD night in the kitchen. I have never stiffed a waiter but this guy needed to be fired. He pissed off at least three tables!  And the blonde manager was a bitch to say the least. I was overcharged for two drinks and the milk desert was trash!  God help this place. It is a cluster!!  Way the hell over priced for trash food. You have been warned!!  Please tell Mac the owner that he has trouble on his hands!!  Never again for me or my friends !!if you drink wine this is not the place to go . All four bottles I purchased were heated or in beer words Skunked I did notice tasty liquors were very cheapo will NEVER buy wine from this placeDespite the fact that they tell you their beans are vegetarian, and put them in the vegetarian burrito, The Original Burrito Company makes their beans with CHICKEN STOCK. 

This is false information they are providing to people, and when people have moral issues with consuming meat, this turns into a huge issue.

I will never eat here again. I do not support businesses that are dishonest.Judging from the other reviews here, I must have come on an off-day. My wife and I picked this place because of the high reviews for an Italian restaurant in that part of town, and we went in with high expectations. 

The first disconcerting thing is that the perspective on the frescoes on the wall is just subtly off enough to give you vertigo the moment you walk into the dining area. Starting off the meal with a faint sense of ill-ease doesn't help the experience. They have beautiful white cloth tablecloths on the table - they cover that with a big sheet of paper, which totally detracts from the ambiance. 

Then came our waiter. I don't know if he had left his girlfriend in the walk-in freezer mid-stroke and was anxious to get back to her, but he was about halfway through our drink order before he was already running away. I almost had to shout across the dining area to get him to hear that both of us wanted a drink, and not just my wife. He disappeared for a long time, and resurfaced after I'd decided, forgotten, and re-decided what I wanted to eat.  We put in our order, he disappeared. He returned a reasonable amount of time later with our carpaccio.

The carpaccio was, quite simply, delicious. However, at any of the other highly-priced Italian restaurants in this city, for the same price, we'd get about double. I expected better; at this point, I was already regretting not going to Scarpetta or The Grotto. Once we finished that, they brought out the bread. Normally, in other restaurants, that comes before the appetizer, but, hey, however they want to do it. 

I ordered the Tortellini Abbruzzese. It had a nice flavor, but could have benefited from using prosciutto instead of sausage. A stylistic choice of the chef with which I don't agree, I'm sure, but it would have made it more enjoyable to me. That said, I still enjoyed it. 

My wife, however, ordered the Linguine Mediterranean. The seafood in it was probably fresh three days prior to us ordering it; by the time it arrived at our table, however, it had a distinctly Billingsgate odor and taste. It was not pleasant. At $22 for a pasta dish, I expect fresh seafood in it. Fortunately, when we got home and gave the three-fourths of it that we had left over to the dogs, they were ok with it. And, of course, my wife won't be happy until I point out that, unlike other quality Italian restaurants, they gave us that nasty Kraft Parmesan-substitute cheese, instead of some fresh-grated Romano or something else of note. Again, the disconnect between what they pretend to be and how they execute is staggering. It's like they're trying to be Olive Garden at Batali prices. It doesn't make sense. 

Finally, the waiter, whose conspicuous absence the whole evening was keenly felt, came back and tried to get all chummy with us to order desert. If he'd interacted with us in any way, I'd not have felt my skin crawl during the interaction; however, since he had reacted to us as if we had leprosy from the moment we sat, it came across as smarmy and car-salesman-y.  

I hated every second I was in the place, and cannot understand the glowing reviews this place gets. Since I can't imagine that all of the other reviewers are idiots, it really MUST have been just an off night last night. Too bad it was SO far off that they will never get a chance to prove that to me. I wouldn't even accept a free meal from them. 

If you are looking for a good night out of high-quality Italian food, hit up the places where Scott Conant and Mario Batali have restaurants. If you want a smaller name, hit the Grotto at Golden Nugget. If you want cheap and edible, go to Olive Garden or Strings. If you want to drop a ton of cash on stuff that my kids could knock together in our kitchen, go to Fellini's.Mediocre food and rude customer service!

I was first attracted to this place because of recommendations from two Hawaii references. When my friends and I walked in and were seated, I was impressed with the extensive menu. So far so good. But when my order arrived, they brought me rice with my beef stew instead of the bread I had ordered. I informed the waiter (who acted like he was the boss) that I had ordered bread instead of rice. He grabbed a menu and rudely pointed out to me that the beef stew comes with rice OR bread and I needed to tell him which I wanted when I ordered. I sharply replied that I indeed had ordered bread. (My dining partner said he heard my order of bread instead of rice, so I wasn't delirious). The rude waiter snatched the plate of rice and brusquely said I would have to wait for the bread.

About 15 minutes later, another waiter finally brought "my" bread when I was almost done with the stew. Two of my other dining mates said they saw the waiter grab the bread from another table to give to me. Naturally, I refused to eat "my" bread since it previously had been on someone else's table. I'm not sure about Las Vegas health department requirements, but it seems to me that restaurants shouldn't be re-serving food that had already been given to others.

The stew broth was so-so in flavor, and the beef was sinewy and tough. I've had way better in Honolulu. Of course, I can't comment on the quality of the bread.

I won't return to this place. I can understand waiters making a mistake on orders. However, in this case, the rude waiter's manner in dealing with the problem - blaming me, the customer - was completely unacceptable and downright RUDE AND OBNOXIOUS. I would give this place a half star at best.It has been awhile since I have been to Aunt Chiladas....and what a disappointment!  Went with a large group, we had horible service.  We were not brought refills, the food came very slowly.  We had to go track down our server and a manager to request service.   Seems like since they were getting an automatic 20% tip because we were a large group she must have gone on break or something.  

Food was very greasy, had oil ladden calabasita and a shredded beaf greasy taco.   

The group I was with was a lot of fun....but the food was not good, and teh service horrible.  Next time the group meets it will not be at this place.I would not take anything here to get it altered.  I had taken my bridesmaid dress in to get altered and they gave me a date to pick it up as well as the price.  When I came in to pick it up, they couldn't find it and when they did it was not ready.  They then told me to come back before the close of business (which probably meant that they would rush it).  I ended up picking it up 1 week later and they could not find it again, and then they tell me that they should have charged me more than what they had originally told me.  On top of that the dress did not fit right and I ended up taking it to another alterations place to have it corrected.Did not stay here...just commenting about the public areas. It looks like a decent place to hang out except for the perfumy STENCH when you walk in. They pump a nauseating, sickly sweet cloying "fragrance" into the casino and lobby that made me and my boyfriend want to get out as quickly as we could. I want to rename this place the POLLUTEZZO!After arriving at the Palazzo we checked in and the staff at the front desk were very friendly.  Once we had our room keys we made our way through the labyrinth to the guest elevators located at the other end of the casino.  We entered our room which was very impressive at first sight. Upon a closer look at the room it was found that the bodily fluids from a man where left behind on the couch.  The front desk was contacted and they advised that they would send housekeeping to correct the matter and change all the bedding.  

I placed a piece of tissue between the sheets to ensure that the bedding had been changed.  When we returned the couch was vacuumed and one could still see that the bodily fluids where still sticking around on the couch.  The bedding had not been changed as the tissue paper still remained in the same location it was placed.  

After more than 48 hours of promises and lies by managers from the three managers in guest services I spoke with the fourth manager Jason had the matter partly corrected although the semen stuck around on the couch for the remainder of our stay.  

Bottom line the Palazzo is not so this and that but I guess they take the "What happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas" serious since that semen stayed for our entire stay in Room #26-829.Not a lot of options as far as food. On top of that you can tell the food has been sitting there for hours, yuck! I'd enjoy my McDonalds meal better then this joint. Service is also lacking. Where the heck is management cause you've got workers just standing and chit chatting!Dog Park? Who are they kidding?! This place was crap, and full of crap.. It looks as though people went in to this park just so their dogs could poop. There were no clean up mitts and it was small and stinky.

Whoever designed this dog park should be kicked in the balls. No grass, all gravel and the one water spigot? That's right -  outside of the park. Brainiack. I wish I would have yelped this before I went. What a waste.I wasn't expecting a lot here, but was still disappointed.  My first tip-off was when I picked up a plate at the front of the buffet and it had little crumbs of wet food and water on it....got grossed out....picked up another....same thing.  EWW.  Now I'm used to getting wet plates at buffets...not sure why that is, but it is expected.  But water AND food?!  Definitely didn't get my appetite going.  : (  

We went to fill our plates and as we were walking back to our table from "round 1", my husband decided that our table was a little too far from all the food (he was right, it was).  I agreed and he politely asked if we could be moved to another area where most of the other people were seated.  The host kind of sighed and acted like this was the most difficult request in history, but moved us anyway.  The new table had lots of crumbs, food scraps and grease on the booth seats, as well as on the table.  YUM.  But it WAS closer to the buffet!  lol

Got settled in at the new table (after using all our napkins wiping it off) and started checking out the food we had chosen.  Nothing that I had really stood out, but most of it was edible.  They had pretty much the standard buffet fare...

-Salads (I didn't have any, but tried the hubby's seafood salad...that was surprisingly tasty)
-Sushi rolls (was scared to try at a buffet....hubby did and said they were "really good"...I took his word for it)
-Cold shrimp (passed on that too....seemed like food poisoning waiting to happen)
-A couple of hot pasta dishes (the penne pasta with cream sauce and mushrooms was good)
-Grilled salmon (YUCK... only ate one bite.  Too fishy smelling/tasting...salmon isn't normally like that)
-Mashed potatoes & various sides (decent, basic stuff)
-Chinese food (eggrolls were good...fried rice and noodle dish, not so much)
-Mexican food (HELL NO)
-Fried shrimp (not bad)
-Lots of dessert (I got all excited because they had a TON of mini desserts...and I am the dessert QUEEN.  ; )  Problem: none of them are really any good!  BOO....)

So, we did our 2nd and 3rd rounds and tried to get as full as humanly possible to get our $19.99 worth.  As I kept walking back and forth, I noticed something else...my shoes kept sticking to the floor really badly, which was a precarious situation while carrying a full plate of food.  : (   It definitely gave me even more reason to think this place definitely hadn't been cleaned properly in a long time.  

While the place was pretty gross and the food was mediocre at best, the kicker was sitting there watching the server dude chat it up with EVERY. SINGLE. TABLE. except for ours, refilling drinks when they were half empty, bringing more napkins, etc, etc....the works....all the while leaving us completely unattended and, towards the end, drink-less too.  I finally had to flag him down to ask for a refill after waiting 10+ minutes to see if he'd get a clue.  He did come grab our empty plates when we were gone at the buffet, but that was IT.  I don't know if we pissed someone off by asking (very nicely) to switch tables, or if we looked young and like we wouldn't leave a tip....I have no clue.  It was so odd and so blatant that it started to feel like one of those hidden camera situations or something!  Weird.  

All I know is that we weren't treated very well here, the food wasn't worth it and the whole place needs a good scrub down.  Find another place to get your buffet on in Vegas because MORE doesn't live up to its name....Convenience brought us to this buffet, two weeks ago on vacation.   Let's just say from this point on I'm going to call it "THE BUFFET THAT TIME FORGOT."  

Sure, it looked like nice food ... but it was completely tasteless.  Seriously!  Devoid of any flavor whatsoever!  It's a sad thing when you pay $17 and the most flavorful thing you experience is the bowl full of watermelon chunks.  

I remember a time, many years ago, when the Luxor was a pretty decent buffet for the price.  Those days are gone.  Spend a few extra dollars are go somewhere else.Horrible Service! We've been waiting the chef so long and also the chef won't start cook if the table isn't full. Never coming back here anymore!I recently moved to Scottsdale and decided to check out the mall. Stores were ok, but the food court was appalling with middle school, high school students yelling profanities and speaking abnormally loud. It was very uncomfortable and don't understand why mall management would let kids behave in that manner. It was culture shock. Worse than any mall I have ever visited. MALL MANAGEMENT - CONTROL THOSE ANIMALS!!!!!I have nothing good to say about this place. Bad service. Bad drinks.  Bad food. Stay away!Seat your self type of place.... Someone 10 min later brought us h2o but we didn't see anyone for at least another 10 min. 

All 4 of us felt sick after we ate there. I kept finding bones in my chicken enchiladas. 

Our drinks were so overly strong, they tasted bad. 

Overall, poor experience, won't be back.I spent $30 per dog tag on two tags that were guaranteed to last. Well only one of them made it, the other one fell apart. I called to see if they could just remake the one that broke since they told me it would last. The other one I bought for my other dog is still in perfect condition. 

  I don't live super close to this location anymore and the petsmart by me doesn't have this new machine to make them. The manager wants me to come in and show it to him so that he can tell me if it's worthy of a replacement or not because people lie to him and he can't take it back if it was abused. 

ok, first of all. my dog weighs 4 pounds, how in the world could she abuse a dog tag? 

second of all, just because some customers have lied to you in the past doesn't mean that I should be punished and be treated like a liar as well.  I spend lots of money at petsmart every year. 

I don't think it's appropriate to make me drive all the way to your store so that you can figure out that I am not a liar. In this case, the manager has all the freedom to decide what he wants regardless of the truth. I would be out gas and time if he chooses to say I abused a dog tag or for whatever reason he wants to make up so that he doesn't have to replace $30.


I will go in for the last time to fight for my replacement and that will be the last time i step into a petsmart. I will find a new store to be loyal to and spend my money where it is appreciated and they don't assume i am a criminal. 

It would be much wiser to replace a dog tag and earn my respect and loyalty than to lose me as a customer. but maybe they are just doing so fabulous in this economy and don't need my money. i doubt it. 

so if you see someone raising hell over a stupid dog tag- its probably me. i will never go down without a fight, LOL! 

get over yourself, petsmart.This is going to be one of the hardest reviews I will ever do! Rio Mirage have been our family favorite since we moved to Surprise three years ago. Yes, it started off with a bump in the road. But this local gem have seen us three to four times a month on a regular bases! Every time we have family visiting, we would bring them to Rio Mirage! This is how much we have loved this place! Sadly, we had a recent issue. And if any of you yelpers out there think I am in the wrong? Please do not hesitate and message me! 
On Jan. 31st, wife and myself was having dinner at Rio Mirage. We noticed a posted sign advertising a Superbowl platter @ $29.95 each. My wife knowing her work was going to have a company party on Feb. 10th. She decided to order five platters, large rice, large beans,  salsa, and chips. Totaling over $400.00, we asked since she was paying for the order that day. Can we get the Superbowl special price? We were told no! Rio Mirage said the platters special were for the Superbowl only. Since the company party was a week after the Superbowl, we had to pay regular price. Even though she paid before the Superbowl?My wife went ahead and placed the order, and still pre-paid the order. Now this is were we are upset about! I have called Rachel Gomez who owns Rio Mirage, and is their corporate contact twice and left a voice mail, I have left two messages on their website, I have sent Rachel an e-mail. All of this since Feb. 1st. As of today! Feb. 12th, we still have not received any replies from Rio Mirage!! This really saddens me, the crew they have working their is great! Always nice, fast, and really try to service you! We have gotten to know JC! The best waiter around, he also tends the bar! But now we have a very bad taste from the management and owners. Regular price on the platters are $40.00 each. Not making a big deal about the $10.00 difference per platter. But a $50.00 difference is not going to make or break this restaurant, Our biggest issue is no one every got back to us about this?
At the bottom of their "About Us" page on their website states:

"Alex and I will always strive to deliver the best food, service, and truly desire to make your every visit a memorable one."

Rachel! With you ignoring our phone calls, messages, and e-mails. This is one statement you truly do not believe in!After seeing a movie we decided to hit Humble Pie for a light bite. We got there just before 9:30. Just a few tables in the restaurant but the hostess was very friendly and we took a seat at the bar. It goes down hill from here! The waiter comes over and says he just wants to let us know they close at 10 and since there aren't many tables in the place they will be putting chairs on the tables and they want out of there. NICE! I can't believe we stayed. We ordered an appetizer and a pasta dish. Both were mediocre at best. We finished and had to wait for the rude waiter to appear with our check. We used to think it was a cute neighborhood restaurant, now, not so much.Now I've been to at least 2 dozen Vegas buffets, and consider myself somewhat of a Vegas buffet connoisseur....and this is the first one that has caused me to say "Wow, that isn't worth anywhere near what I paid!!!"  At most Vegas buffets, you get more or less what you pay for.  My main area of expertise is the Champagne Brunch, and Vegas has quite the variety.  I've seen everything from the $8.99 Sahara (RIP) that served their champagne in plastic cups from some bizarre powdery mixture, to the Bellagio, which for $25 will get you a good selection of high-quality food and the coldest milk money can buy, to the Wynn, where $45 will get you every bizarre food under the sun (yet somehow omit the one food you crave most at any brunch buffet.....bacon).

Anyways....The Flamingo buffet hits bottom rung in pretty much every category.  Poor selection, poor quality, high price, and to top it off you have to pay $10 extra for champagne (unless you happen to be a diamond Total Rewards member)!  At $25 plus $10 for champagne, you get basically the smallest buffet in Vegas.  They do throw a few crab legs and shrimp in to justify the price, but don't be fooled.  They were well-below-average quality, even for buffet standards.  And the rest of the buffet is no better....I've seen $10 Fremont-strip buffets with twice the selection and better quality!

The wait staff was friendly and attentive, so I have no qualms there.  However, they were balanced off by the surly crepe chef....  I get to the front of the line and ask for my crepe with "everything".  She says, "Everything?"  I say ,"Yes, everything," and point to each of the toppings (apple, strawberry, chocolate, whipped cream, and nutella).  She gets angry, throws strawberries and chocolate on my crepe, and yells, "Next!"  Who does that?  It doesn't cost you anything.  Even if you think the combination is disgusting, just throw the junk on the crepe and the drunk idiot will go away and be happy.  Now you made him sad.

So if you happen to be in the market for a champagne brunch, pass by this one and don't look back.  There are plenty more that are well worth your while....TI, Paris, Aria, Planet Hollywood...just to name a few.It's unfortunate that this is the closest WalMart to me because it is literally the worst Walmart EVER! Not only is there ALWAYS a line because there's never enough employees working but you can count on some idiot in the 20 items or less line with MORE THAN 20 ITEMS! Did I mention the clientele is HORRIBLE?! Whoever manages this Walmart needs to open their eyes! ::Written while waiting in line at THIS VERY WALMART!!::We chose Bourbon Steak for restaurant week and were sadly disappointed. We were seated in the bar not the actual restaurant as apparently they did not want to offend regular clientele with the servings. Several couples were  all seated together along a wall with the restaurant week menus. The server came and told us he recommended a Kobe steak, interesting, as it was the most expensive item. We were given a salad that honestly had 4 bites. The portions were small and the food was so average. Will never be back.We stopped in before the movies across the street for a sake bomb and some sushi. My side of the table was sticky, eeewww. And the sushi was very underwhelming, the quality was not great, especially for the price. Even the miso soup was weird and frothy. At least we didn't get food poisoning. We will not return.OMG, we stayed at Harrah's and happened to past by the cafe after clubbing and saw this huge steak and eggs deal for $5.99. When the food came, the steak was so chewy and wasn't cooked right. The hashbrown was cold, the only thing that was decent are the eggs.I was super disappointed with Blue Burrito.  I realize it is in the airport, but I thought that being in the southwest would get me something that could at least compete with Taco Bell.  Not the case.  The only upside was that it was pretty fast.This place sucked and I don't feel the need to return. Friends from work were planning a birthday happy hour and called two weeks ago to find out information on providing a location for the event. Approximately 20 people would be coming and the person making the call asked if that would be an issue and if reservations needed to be made. She was told no, it would be fine. The restaurant is very spacious, so it could easily handle a group that size. 

My friend and I arrived first yesterday to secure the tables. The hostess said she didn't think she could accommodate us because they did have several parties that made reservations. She hesitated, but eventually said she could probably put about 15 in one area, which we accepted. It took a while, but the staff assembled three or four tables to provide the area we needed. We went ahead and sat down and my friend asked the waiter when happy hour began and what specials they had. The waiter stated the happy hour was only in the bar area or patio, and not at the tables. He left and then a manager came out and repeated the same thing. My friend asked what if people walked to the bar, ordered and paid for the drink and returned to the table. The manager said no, you can't do that. We explained there would be people at the table eating in the restaurant portion, but there might be people order drinks from the bar and come back. The manager said if that were to happen, he couldn't hold the tables for us. While the explanation was occurring the waiter was kind enough to bring out some water for us, and a third member of our party showed up to order a diet coke and was planning on getting the quesadilla, but waited. Soon it became clear this place would not work out too well for the party.

Looking over the menu, the prices seemed too high for a bar with a bull in inside. $10 burgers, egg rolls for $9, $8 quesadillas, $10 salads and $9 specialty drinks.  Happy hour prices the specialty drinks come down to $5, imports and well drinks for $3 and domestics for $2 - but again, only in the bar and only in the first-come-first-serve patio area.  If you have a large group, you most likely won't be to be in one of those areas or see those prices.

I do know some restaurants keep the happy hour prices contained to certain areas, but it typically depends on the restaurant structure. A place, for example Applebees, is mostly restaurant and happens to have a bar, so it would make sense to keep the prices separate. Cadillac Ranch is more bar than restaurant. I don't know too many places trying to promote a nice restaurant image that would have a mechanical bull in main area.  Apparently the management is not interested in the revenue that 15-20 people eating and drinking all night would generate.

After the manager's conversation, the waiter was a little slow in returning. I walked down to San Felipe but they could not accommodate our party at the last minute. In the end, we found a suitable location that provided the service, the happy hour pricing and atmosphere we wanted.

Thanks, Cadillac Ranch, but no thanks.Scottsdale BBQ Co - I won't be repeating this visit.

I saw some good reviews here on Yelp and I was excited for another BBQ option near my work. Friends had been here a little while back and said it was good. Upon arrival they commented that things had changed and perhaps it was new ownership. I don't know when they last visited this place and it may have been a while ago.

Two of us ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac and cheese ($7.50) and our third order a brat with a side of cole slaw.

While it was about 85 out when we visited it wasn't really cooler inside; in fact, it was bit stifling so we chose to sit outside on their small patio. Only one table was set up to accommodate three people so we took that one but had to clear the full ashtray off of it and the copy of New Times. (Maybe it is the employee smoke break table?)

The table itself was filthy. Loose tobacco on the vinyl table cloth and the distinct feel of dirt when leaning on the table. The table cloths were held to the metal tables with binder clips - and each clip had a ring of aged dirt buildup around it. 

Our food took about fifteen minutes to arrive, which in my opinion is about an eternity in the BBQ world as most is prepared though perhaps they grilled the brat to order - that could have been the time delay.

Pulled pork on wheat - great wheat bun, almost an artisanal flavor and texture. The pork itself was watery and it dripped out a lot of water when I picked up the sandwich. In fact, the drained water was enough that I could not set my sandwich down in the basket lest the bun soak up that water.  The pork was not anything special, nor was the spicy sauce.

The mac and cheese side was not flavorful either. I was hoping for a sharp cheese bite but I got nothing. I didn't finish my side.

The brat and sauerkraut were well received and enjoyed immensely by my friend. He sent back the cole slaw as it apparently tasted "off". I didn't try it and verify.

I like the fact that they brew the iced tea and offer plain, sweetened and green tea options.

Service was very friendly and when we sent back the cole slaw they offered to bring another side or refund the cost of the slaw. Great service there, and they did a nice job of offering utensils, clearing the table, etc.

There are certainly some well meaning, friendly operators here but for me there were way too many negatives for me to want to repeat.Went here today and the place was closed! I read online that they closed due to health code fines. Too bad i didn't get to try it! :(I stopped here for fuel and a car wash on my way from the gym to work the other day.  My car was in desperate need of a bath, and I didn't have time to visit my favorite Cobblestone car wash in Scottsdale.  

Because I did not want to continue to drive in shame, I figured a nice little rinse at the quick car wash would at least help a little.  My car is black and was so dirty it was starting to look like it had a nice gray primer coat on it.

When the soapy cycle of the wash began, I noticed something flying above my car.  To my surprise, I looked up and notice several pigeons riding back and forth on the car wash "arm".  To their credit, the pigeons looked quite happy going back and forth...back and forth.  I think one of them smiled at me. 

(A side note...where there are birds ready to poop, they will find me somehow.  I must have a poop magnet somewhere around me because it ALWAYS happens.)

I am already stuck in neutral and it's still in the soap phase of my wash.  So I sit and wait.  I count how long it takes before one of the birds craps on my freshly rinsed car.  Of course, within moments of the dryer beginning and the green light flashes, I notice a nice little white pile on the hood of the car.  To make things even more enjoyable, the dryer smears the freshly deposited prize across my hood.  After all, who wants wet pigeon poop on their car?

Moral of the story peeps...if you want pigeon poop and a car wash, this is THE place to be!  I was in a bit of a hurry so I didn't ask for my money back.  However, I did make a courtesy call later to kindly remind the owners of the gas station that they have some squeaky clean pigeons living in their car wash.  They didn't seem thrilled with my sarcasm.Service here is horrible. They didn't page us for a table. I watched our server B.S. with another table while we were ignored for 15 minutes. I can't comment on the food because after a half hour, our sandwiches just arrived.Horrid service and terrible food. Friday night at seven with an empty dining room should have been my first clue.
The waitresses and waiters have the personalities of a brick wall. I've had better revive at a gas station. 
My wife had the New York steak and veggies. Her steak was about a half inch thick but she said it was ok. I ordered fish and chips. Both our meals came with a salad and a role. I love salad dressing or anything that hides the taste of anything that looks like a vegetable but my salad was swimming in dressing. There were floating croutons and a life raft that looked like a cucumber. The roll was good.
My fish and chips were among the worst I have ever had. I have had better fish and chips in an elementary school. The fries tasted like they had been sitting around for a few hours and the pieces of fish were dripping with grease. The coleslaw was brown and looked bed. I wasn't even willing to try the coleslaw. The fish was over cooked so the meat was tough and dry and the batter was a dark brown that tasted like the grease was weeks old.
When I told the waiter that my meal was so bad, he chewed me out and told me I should have told him sooner. He did offer me something else but I declined. He said he has replaced meals "many times." This should be a problem in his eyes. He did take the meal off our bill but did charge us for the salad. Amazing that they would nickel and dime a patron who had a bad experience. My whole meal should have been removed from the bill. When this restaurant first opened, many years ago, there were long wait times but the food and service was great. THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE.
save yourself some time, money, and a stomach ache, avoid the Sundance Grill at the Silverton.Overall was truly disappointed by this experience......was there with a large group....and it took over 3 1/2 hrs to eat and get our check .Apparently our party according to management(Brian) was just too large to handle. 
My food( the sushi/sashimi combo) was just OK ....nothing to get excited about. 
I will never come back here .....and would encourage all of you to look for a better place to spend your money.I had arranged a 3 month stay for work. I was placed into a 'nicer room' considering my stay. The shower didn't work, the bed was infested with bed bugs, and there is poverty swarming the area. Stay away.This review is only for Timeshare presentation and their salesmen/saleswomen.



Before coming to the tour and presentation, we (my friends and I) already knew that we would have to face persistent salesmen/saleswomen based on the info they gathered when they signed us up for the tour and presentation.
Well, for discounted show tickets, we all didn't mind to attend their tour and presentation.



After attending their tour and presentation (including the sales pitches), I'd say this timeshare is quite shady. Too many lies involved. 

1. We've been told that the tour and presentation will take about 2-3 hours (it was also stated on the agreement paper we signed), but the entire event actually took about 4-5 hours.
2. They kept claiming and emphasizing that buying the timeshare is the same as buying a land. Not true. There is no actual land. It's totally different from buying a real land or a house. This timeshare is more like buying a stock at a stock market or buying a shared vacation membership. 
3. They said they are not pushing people to buy, but some of the representatives there, especially the beautiful-and-gorgeous "manager," were quite pushy. Even worse, the beautiful-and-gorgeous "manager" started talking to us with attitude after she kept failing to make us buy the cheap deals she could give to us. In my opinion, a manager should have shown a better customer service skill than the lower-level representative (the lady who gave us the tour and presentation).
4. The feedback room was actually not a true feedback room. It was more like "another-attempt-to-sell-their-timeshares" room. The lady in the feedback room only asked us 2 short feedback questions that was done in less than 1 minute. After that, here comes another sales pitch, titled "the lowest deal for today," for about 15-20 minutes. 



The presentation and the lowest deal they offered were actually quite awesome. 
If only they didn't commit so many lies, we might go back to them and buy their timeshare in the future. 



 Anyways, I give 1 star just for the comp (discounted show tickets) plus the tour & presentation from the first lady meeting us there, who was the most friendly and the least pushy.ok first off I would like to say to the idiots at the grandview who respond to bad reviews that you are idiots. I was told 2-3 hours of a presentation it turned into 4 1/2 hours. To the woman who will respond to this my girl and I laughed at the fact you said because of the food the time was extended. If I could curse I would call you a dumb female dog. it took us 5 min to eat the 2 week old bagels and the nasty coffee. it took long because when we said no they dicked us around. and the fat asian dude who was our salesperson was nice until he knew we werent going to buy. then he was a ash whole. his manager (god bless him) told us a story of how he got shot to try to make us feel bad for not buying the timeshare. he was also a dick. then after we said no again they dicked us around even more and we had to wait in a dumb waiting room for an hour to leave the place. we just said F it and we got a cab. however out of everything There was a guy named Jerry we got to talk to. Probibly the nicest person I've met in vegas. but all in all the experience was dumb. the only good thing we got out of it was the free tickets and meeting jerry. other than that if anyone goes there for the free tickets just tell the person that you are only there for the tickets before hand and just keep asking when the presentation will be over. for all them being rude I think everyone should just use them for what they are good for. free tickets. ps the food consisted of sandwhiches and pastries. all of which tasted like it was left out for a few weeks.Never Never Never again! This place is anything but worth your money. We went this past Saturday for their 2nd year anniversary party and it was horrible. When we arrived at 11pm and meet up with a couple friend of ours it looked as though it might be a great night. we even had a chance to dance! we had been here a few times before and even though we had to leave then because a security had maced someone and it got in the system making the entire room choke; for some odd reason i thought that was a rare occurrence.  and even this night, when meeting a girl and her group standing near the bar; as she told me she had my back if anyone tries to start anything with us, i didn't think twice about people fighting in a club; i mean that's what happened when you were in high school right? i explained to her how  positivity is on my side and her response was "yeah but sometimes that positivity brings negativity in here." i was still baffled but thought ok, must be a rough day for her. but low and behold SHE was right!!!! some rooster looking girl tried to start a fight with one of my chicas because she was smiling in her direction! and the worst part about it, she had just tried to sucker punch me before that because i wouldn't let her big ass friend dirty dance on me. they were dirty dancing and letting all their rolls hang out; but because we are skinny, they thought we were an easy target. security seen it all, witnessed them come at us 4 three times and didn't do anything but move crazy eyes to another part of the club. well low and behold you can't keep a caged animal unleashed, so she came back with all her vigor towards her again. i couldn't believe that security would allow such a brazen & ugly girl back in the area only to start another fight. now i totally understand what that first girl was referring too! now i understand why there are always fights in this place, why the mace was sprayed last time, why when i mention PHX to some people they roll their eyes and vow not to ever attend anything there again.

the crowd wasn't even good looking. it was like they scrapped the bottom of the barrel. the door charge was $15 and the drinks were $10 each. they had no A/C on, but many fans and burning candles (yeah they must not comprehend the fact that candles are heat conductors).  at our arrival the door security guy tried to frisk me 3 times. i asked for a lady to do it and he hassled me, but never the less i didn't let him frisk me; and the only reason we stayed was because we had 5 other girls and 5 guys meeting us there. now i know why there where 4 cop cars outside their doors. this place is the worst place to go for hip hop the only good thing about the entire night was listening to DJ robby rob. 

so if your looking for a fight, want to see big, and i mean BIG girls bumping and grinding on the dance floor in their too tiny tops and skirts letting all them rolls poke out then this is the place for you, if your looking to get maced just hanging out dancing and chocking to death then go to PHX in downtown phoenix, but if your looking for a great time to dance, chill with your friends and meet some classy and fun people DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT go to the PHX in downtown phoenix.Here is my two  word opinion of The Shout House:  Never again!
First of all, you have two guys banging on pianos at the top of their lungs.  Not for me.  Major headache after a couple hours there.  Major.
However, for those with not such great hearing, it would be a fun place to spend an evening.
The service is horrid and the waitresses are slow and seemingly uncaring for the most part, but nobody will care if they are having fun I think.  I definitely wasn't more and more as  the evening wore on.
If you don't hear so well as I seem to, you will just love this fun, enthusiastic place.
I was there at the beginning of a Friday night until maybe 9pm.  I understand it gets more raunchy as the night wore on.  THIS was my mistake going there so early.  I'd rather get a few laughs from the raunchy cause early in the evening it was waaaay too tame for me, personally, but to each their own.
A gal I know with meetup.com complained it was way too vulgar at the end of the evening.  She's been coddled, obviously, and was probably mortified if anyone said, "poop."  So, like I said, to each their own.
It was the constant loud noise that burned me out and not the bad service or the non-rauncy lyrics I heard.  This, I guess, is one of the downfalls of having better than normal hearing....crap!Fries and shakes are the only this I liked about this place. Both my husbands and my burgers were dry and seriously lacking flavor. Service was terrible as well.I'm an elite yelper. WHY DIDNT I LOOK AT THE REVIEWS BEFORE I BOOKED?!

Everything they say about this company 'nickle and diming' you is TRUE!  My car was supposed to cost $32... I ended up paying like $70 for all their fees and very true, the sales guy seemed to even be hitting on me to get me to upgrade to a Mustang. He's like, you're on vacation can't you see yourself riding around town in a NICE car? He winked like he was giving me a deal that I could upgrade to a Mustang for $15 more (And why did he offer the information that he is single with a kid and he and his ex arestill friendly with one another? Lets keep it professional ok?) I politely declined the upgrade, but I wanted to say... a Mustang is not rolling in style like you make it out to be I'll just stay with the Hyundai I am already getting. I just need to get from point A to point B cheaply, otherwise I'd have rented from Enterprise or Hertz.. Oh and I got an alert that my card was charged $200.  I never was informed verbally that this would happen.  Irritating!
OH! AND!  My flight when returning the car was slated to leave at 930pm domestic.  I wanted to turn the car in at 815pm... he said I needed to get the car in no later than 730pm or I would be CHARGED ANOTHER DAY!  Mind you, I didn't want to be charged a full other day so i got to the airport at 730pm even though my flight got delayed to 1030pm... so because of their inflexibility... I had to wait at the airport for 3 hours for a 1 hour flight. Again... no good!

I guess what really angered me is that I had filled up the car... and yeah, I took a wrong turn and the needle wasn't tilted all the way to the utmost position by the time I got to the airport, but I filled that car... they said it was only 7/8 full and that I needed to return it with a full tank.. so they charged me... $12!!! Outfreaking-rageous! 

I ended up spending about $100 for what I thought would only be $30 something... arg.

Just badness.i almost rented from the good thing i didnt because,the reservation i had made previously did not matter because they where out of cars when i got to the front of the line after waiting for almost an hour in line .never rent from them againMy poor husband came into this restaurant yesterday at noon and ordered their Yum Yum Chicken. While he was waiting for his order he heard a microwave being operated in the back! When he got his chicken home and proceeded to eat it. He ate one piece of chicken and noticed it lacked "freshness." He had me taste it to make sure and I immediately spit it out!! It had the flavor of tainted meat all in my mouth and the chicken was so rubbery!!
My husband now has mild food poisoning today, thanks to Yan's and has not been able to eat a decent meal today because of it and other unpleasant symptoms.

Too many a times have they served us bunk food....Forget this place, I'm never being disappointed here again!!!

Where can I find some real chinese food around here??   No where. Guess I'll save my appetite for California, where all the food is fresh.This is a chain restaurant.  Been to another location with a better dining experience.  I don't mind waiting for a table, but I do expect decent food and service.  

The wait was over 30 minutes.  We weren't told that the counter was first come, first serve however. I guess not too bad for mid-Saturday morning.  The waitress was extremely rushed.  I asked if the corned beef hash was chunks or minced.  She said small pieces that are minced.  I watched the cook divide a plate of eggs into 2....not what I want to see.  The corned beef was strips.  I tried to eat it anyway but it tasted watered down...no flavor.  

Very loud, small environment.  Not what I was looking for at all.  Much better breakfast options in town.Super slowwwww service. It wasn't busy and they were too scared to bring out all the meat at the same time, so that was super annoying. 

There's a two hour limit for dinner and you'll most likely hit it because it takes 20 minutes for your small portions of meat to come out. That's before cook time!

 Food is good but definitely not good enough to come back because the service was way too slow.never ever again! my family & i were craving pupusas and this is the closest place to us so it seemed perfect...now im thinking gosh if only we would have just driven a bit more and gone to las pupusas then we all wouldnt have gotten food poisoning! i had to miss work today on top of that...i should have seen the warning signs...when i first called they said the total would be 12.97...when i got there she told me 13.00 now its just 3 pennies so i didnt even complain...now i am because it wasnt worth any of our pennies! 2nd there was a weird smell upon walking in...now i saw a couple of ppl eating there so i thought well its probably not too bad and since its almost closing theyre probably cleaning or something & i did just come out of an amazing smelling car...WRONG! they are just nasty period and the pupusas came out as the greasiest pupusas ive ever seen!we had to wipe and soak all that grease off of them....why didnt we see all the warnings?! im half salvadorian trust me it was just masa rolled in grease! avoid avoid avoid....try las pupusas or anywhere else instead!I used to love you, Al-Hana.  I have fond memories of enjoying good food and good company while sitting at your little wobbly tables and chairs.  I fell in love with your babaghannuj.  Yes, you had a lot going for you.

I was disappointed, but kept coming back, when you decided to raise the price on Every Single Item I Like, while making all of the portions smaller.  I understood that you have to pay for those new glossy menus with the pretty pictures somehow even though I liked the old menu board with the plastic letters just fine, thanks.  I settled for slow and sometimes surly service from your staff.  Why?  Because I loved you. 

Well, I think our one-sided relationship has come to an end.  That last visit - you know, the one where you gave our food to another customer (uh, you were confused?), and left us waiting for over 35 minutes without an apology while fulfilling orders for people who arrived and ordered much much later?  That will be my last one.  

I especially will cherish the charming way in which the 'manager' grudgingly provided a refund for the food I never received.  "Do you want to return the water as well?"  Um, no.  Since I had to get it out of the cooler myself, I actually received that portion of what I ordered.  Thanks.

Keep your rising prices and shrinking portions.  You are no longer worth my affection.I have been coming here for years because of the wonderful service and how clean my car would be, well all that was ruined today. My boyfriend and I both came in for a wash, he got the  detail and vip wash and I got the carpet cleaning  and vip wash.  They were not terribly busy we showed up around 1pm my car was not completed for over an hour and a half and my boyfriends took over three, but the wash was piss poor they didn't even clean my side runners, they were still covered in dirt and grim none of the dead bugs on my hood were cleaned off and the inside windows on my car were not cleaned,  that was just my car.  My boyfriends car like I said took over 3 hour and likewise his wax job was half assed and they did jot clean the windows. I will NEVER come back, ever. The funniest part was they tried to up sale me while we were waiting for my boyfriends car to be finish. I felt like saying why would I buy more of your services when my car wash was so pitifully terrible a .  Not a happy camper at all!!!!!!!!I am sick to my stomach... I have to submit a star as a way of rating this %# hole!! I opened this YELP account for the sole purpose of writing this review...... I will follow up with pictures, but do not have time as enough time has been wasted... I am not sure how to put it.. I waited just 40 minutes for my car to go from the gas pump to the Auto-wash area talk about speedy service... After 40 minutes I made the manager aware of the long amount of time it was taking for my car to get into the bleeping wash.... He explained the reason was a car in front of my car was full of dog hair that needed extra attention and it took 35 minutes to vacuum...40 minutes to get it in the wash....!!   I am not exaggerating the times here!! To put this in to perspective you know the point where they complete the glass and interior well 70 minutes had gone by and I was at the 3rd car back in this line!!! This is even after notifying a the manager KEVIN Duche!!! All in all my car never made it to the interior cleaning or glass cleaning area.. It simply finished drying in line in line... I had the manager pull 2 cars out of the way so I could leave... The chalk is still on my windows from where they documented my wash and the time I arrived 12:31 PM... I didn't leave until 1:46 PM and my car STILL  didn't get dried or the interior cleaned... COME ON MAN!! FIRE KEVIN THE MANAGER... This GUY IS A FN JOKE... THIS CAR WASH IS A JOKE.. THIS PLACE IS GARBAGE bring the immigrants back holy %^&^!~!  I am so pissed off I wish we lived in mid evil times ... NEVER TAKE YOUR VEHICLE HERE EVER!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED...This is the slowest Starbucks I have ever been toDo not got here! I thought it was going to be mugged by the therapist!! Worse experience of my life!! First, the therapist opened the door wearing what appeared to be a sailor moon outfit, but since she was overweight and pretty ugly I thought there was a chance she was just a bad dresser and not a happy ending girl. I think I was wrong. The worse massage ever!! It was 40 for 45 minutes, it lasted 35 minutes and she started massaging my inner thighs. The most disturbing part is we didn't tip because they shorted us on time and it was not even close to a decent massage and the "therapist" followed us out to the car, opened my car door and demanded a tip!!! I wish I was making this up!!! The sign says reflexology, but there is no way, I have had better massages during a pedicure. I hope the authorities bust this place soon.

THE WOMAN FOLLOWED US TO OUR CAR, OPENED THE DOOR AND DEMANDED A TIP WHILE SCREAMING!!! AFTER WE PAID 80 DOLLARS FOR A REALLY BAD MASSAGE. DO NOT GO HERE.Absolutely the worst customer service. I had to be put on medical leave and had a note from my doctor which ended up to be a complete headache. They told me the wrong info over the phone for cancellation. When I went into the club they were rude. If you are going to spend the money I would just go to the village. They at least take care of their members.What a complete and utter disappointment!  My husband and I went their today for a late lunch, and by late I'm talking about 3pm, so we completely missed the lunch rush.  The place was not at all busy and we sat at a table in the half empty bar.  We sat there for 10-15 minutes and no one came over to take our drink orders, give us menus, or even acknowledge our presence.  We didn't even get an "I'll be right with you."  After waiting for as long as we did and still thirsty and starving, we got up to leave.  On the way out I mentioned to the hostess who thanked us for coming that we were never even served.  She said she would tell a manager, but who knows if that happened.  Afterwards, we drove to Hooters and got excellent service and were served immediately.  The Buffalo wild wing server lost out on a big tip.  Next time serve your customers.Called to make a rezo for Mother's Day said not needed I showed up and said we only taking rezos tried to talk to the owner at the stand got the the brush offTerrible service! I had to ask the waitress for napkins three times, instead of bringing the napkins she went and sat at a booth with some customers. I had to get up and get my own napkins. 

When I paid, she didn't bring me a receipt back and the change was incomplete. This place just keeps getting worse.Yelp you failed us on this one. There is no way this place is not using a microwave. We had the chicken parm and shrimp linguini. The chicken was absolutely disgusting almost in edible. The shrimp fared a bit better but still not up to par. Do yourself a favor for 5.00 more a plate go to lavo you won't be disappointed.This used to be my go to place. Unfortunately, times have changed. There are a very select few that do a good job, but the majority of them are lazy and rush you. 


Today when I went, the girl who did my nails had to be physically woken up from a chair she was sleeping in. She came over, didn't say anything. I told her I didn't want them cut. Next thing I know one is cut super short. Then I told her to stop. But she insisted they be even and kept cutting. So now I have short stubby nails. Then comes the paint job. She gets it everywhere! I have her clean it up and there still are spots on the edges of my fingers. She doesn't bother to even file the ends of my nails. Next thing I know, she is getting up and moving to give someone a pedicure. I go up to the front and say I guess I need to pay, and they look at me like I'm crazy. They go over to the girl and I finally get to pay. 

I have been a loyal customer here for over 4 years. I was able to look past a few things in the past, but today was the final straw. Unfortunately they have lost myself, as well as any of my girl friends that ask where to go.Horrible old or chubby dancers. Walked in and didn't see a girl on stage for 20 minutes. When she was done took about another twenty minutes for another one two show up. The dancers walking around (2-4 girls at a time) all sunk like piss and/or BO.  Bought some expensive tokens for my friends to have some fun with, huge mistake,  told they never expired. left the club because it sucked so bad. went back two days later just to use up the tokens and were told they had expired because they were only good for 24 hours. Manager was a jerk to say the least and wouldn't even comp our cover charge even after the token screw job.  Don't waste your cab fair, time, money or anything else of value going to this joke of a club.I would NOT recommend. It's overpriced, even for Vegas. I went in expecting cool ice sculptures and fun activities, only to find a small room with ice on the walls. My freezer is more entertaining. 

They yelled at us for every activity and so we walked out.I love Pho and have been to many Pho places.  I grew up in Socal so i've eaten in Little Saigon, i've been invited to Vietnamese families that cook Pho.  I make my own pho at home about once a month so I know a few things about pho.  Jenni Pho I would rank as one of the worst pho i've ever eaten.  The broth is epic FAIL.  It's flavorless, it lacks the subtle charred onion and ginger flavor, the meaty and rich taste that comes from oxtail and bone marrow, and the spices of cinnamon, cloves, and star anise.  The noodle was ok but the rare sliced steak came out over cooked.  The size was decent but I didn't want to finish it.  I left disappointed but knowing that since i've had the worst, i know my next pho experience else where has to be better.Currently having a liquidation sale, but it's not really worth the trip.  I found that most books were cheaper at Amazon then the sale price.  A few were even cheaper at Barnes and Noble then the liquidation sale price!  Which just made me say to myself well that's probably why you're going out of business try some competitive pricing!  The place is an absolute disaster they've moved a lot so the sales staff doesn't even know where everything is.  Also the place just smells dirty and old, it's very unwelcoming.  It's really no surprise to me they couldn't get customers before.First off what I can say is,NEVER COME HERE. HORRIBLE service, RUDE staff and UNCOOKED food! I was excited to go to this place but when I walked in I definitely did regret coming here. I went on a Friday night and it was HORRIBLE service. I will never be coming back here even if I got a free meal here. The hostess are not nice at all and My family and I had to wait 10 minutes just to get a table. The noise level is very very very loud in here! Like this place was more of a bar all throughout the restaurant than just in it's own area. All you here is drunk people screaming and laughing very loud and the whole time I couldn't even hear my family say something because it was that loud, we had to scream to talk and for one of us to even hear each other. The service is horrible. We had to wait 20 minutes before my mom finally asked a server if someone was going to help us. All the servers just looked at us as they were walking by and didn't even bother to ask if we have been helped or not. We finally got sent a server and he was horrible. He asked us what we wanted drinks and we ordered and then for 20 minutes he just disappeared out of no where and never brought us our drinks. We left him no tip. My mom finally flagged over a girl and she was so so nice she apologized a lot and brought us our drinks right away after we told her what we had ordered. The guy server before her never even came back to us to say sorry and we didn't see him for the rest of the night. Even when we were waiting for food the new girl server told us it was super busy and we wouldn't have to wait much longer which I liked a lot. The food was horrible. I got The Las Vegas Roll and is was so gross. The fried part on the outside was super cold and so was the fish on the inside like it had been sitting out for a long period of time. I did feel sick after eating it and i'm surprised I didn't puke. I couldn't even finish all of it. This place is more a bar scene, very loud, horrible service, and definitely not for families especially if you have little kids. Definitely will not be coming back here.this is a busy dirty walmart and you shoud stay away from it. shop at a targetFour words:
I tossed me cookies.
Arrrrrr.
This place made me upchuck me dinner fro' yesterday night!
I would not go here even if I was dead and had nothing to loseAn Eiffel Tower-shaped drink is cool in concept, but in reality.....the design of it is not consumer-friendly!

If you have limp, spaghetti arms like me, and drink slow, the Eiffel Tower drink will start getting really, really heavy when walking the strip.  I ordered the margarita strawberry daiquiri, and guess what...now i know, i'm not a fan of margaritas.  I like my mixed drinks to hide all traces of alcohol taste, yet still deliver the same drunken consequences and have me holding on to the ground to keep me from falling off the earth.  If you don't mind the taste, the drink does pack quite a punch.  I had to throw in ice cubes to dilute that bad boy.

Tip of advice from a Vegas party veteran: Skip the Eiffel Tower. Grab the guitar or fat tuesday bong-looking drink, basically anything that comes with a STRAP!  We all know that the last thing you want to have to worry about while walking around inebriated is HOLDING ONTO YO DRINK!ahhhhh why does everyone where this cheap crap? Now my daughter wants to wear it. This is outsoursing at it's worse. It barely makes it through the wash.This place sucks. Waited in line for twenty minutes since there was supposed to be a "free" cover. Got to the door and the dooshbag bouncers didn't care to stand by what the advertised, so we spent our money elsewhere. I do not support businesses that pull bait and switches, and I hope others don't either. Im glad I didn't go there and had a great time at a much more upscale bar with less sloppies trying to get numbers.-UGH!! Poor quality, inconsistant bagels! Why are my bagels different thickness? I didn't order "thin bagels". When did Asiago Cheese become a "cheese pancake"???

-Cashier tells me that the "Asiago Cheese" has always been thin...(um, no they haven't!) This shouldn't had been served to customers.

-Saw the young high-school employee dude throw some bacon into the microwave...euw! No napkin, no plate, no wax paper...WTH?

-Slow service! Stuck behind an indecisive lady...ugh! C'mon lady chose a damn bagel and ice tea and move along! 

-The cashier was a young (inexperienced) gal who had the IQ of a potato, it was obvious she didn't know how to work the register either...why bother having people like this handle money transactions????

-Parking is ok

-It was way too much of a hassle to run in to get a bagel here...poor food quality, terrible service, Inconsistant food quality, and inexperienced employees. :(

-Next time, I'll go into a Safeway to get a bagel...less hassle!

-WORST Einsteins that I have ever been to! Is this one a franchise???I had an early morning flight and decided to grab something at the airport. Unfortunately I decided to grab a cinnamon roll at Paradise Bakery. Since I've had nothing but positive experiences with the cinnamon roll from their majority owner Panera Bread in Chicago, I thought this was a slam dunk. It was obvious to me that they served me left overs from the day before because it sure didn't taste fresh. The baker must have slept in that morning or called in sick. The service is Sloooow as well. They try to multitask and help other customers part way through my transaction, very annoying.Worst service ever had i got there two hours before my flight and didn't even get to order!! The saddest part is I was seated right next to where they put in the orders and other staff didn't even ask if I was ready to order and to top it off they tried to seat me at a dirty table to start off .. The waitress didn't have a name tag that I could read so I can't name drop but this is truly the worst experience i ever had with California pizza which is sad because they actually have really good pizza.EWW!! Never will I EVER return to this pathetic attempt of a restaurant.  I got a chicken Caesar salad and a cup of tomato basil soup with cheese tortalini.  Pretty simple right? So so wrong.  First of all, the menu said the salad was "romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers and parmesan cheese"  the salad I actually received was wilted romaine with parmesan...only...

Do not even get me started on the soup... there was not one tortalini in it and it was luke warm upon arrival.  Not to mention it was just completely disgusting. 

The service was just as terrible as the food, our server said she didn't have change for a 20.  Which is pretty baffling considering I'm sure some people have paid cash or will pay cash, so as a business it seems somewhat imperative to have cash on hand.  Anyways, she basically demands a credit card.  I refuse.  She comes back what seems like 15 mins later (keep in mind I told her we were in a hurry at this point) with change down to the penny?! Seems like someone is just lazy and didn't want to ask the bar for change. I use to be a server so I know how that goes. 

AVOID. AVOID. AVOID.I took my 7 yo son here for a treat and it was not good.  The staff was super friendly and I love that it comes from a local farm so I had very high hopes!  BUT, the ice cream was so bland and just not flavorful at all :(.  I had strawberry and my son had bubble gum.  Even my 7 yo, who is an ice cream -aholic like his mother (me) didn't finish his cone.  Thank goodness I used a coupon, otherwise I really would've been unhappy!If you go there, I suggest skipping on the fish. I chose to put crab and pollock in my stir fry and have never been more sick. Ate my meal at about 6:30, had an uneasy stomach for the rest of the evening, woke up at 4:30 in the morning with horrible stomach pain and nausea. That was the only meal of the day to cause me to feel that way. Horribly disappointed as the service was otherwise great, minus being a little slow but that was because of the dinner rush. Will not be returning as I have no desire to risk repeating that experience again, which is a shame because I really wanted those cheesecake rangoons...I NEVER go to these types of restaurants. My daughter asked to go to Carrabas so we did. I hate them on principal and that will never change. With that being said, here is an honest review from my daugter, wife and myself.

SERVICE: NON EXISTENT. Thats all I can say. Took our drink order and food order and then NEVER saw the server again. UGGGH !

AMBIENCE: Just like all the other ones. Fake, insincere, cookie cutter restaurant. CORPORATE taste is on every plate. 

FOOD:  Caesar salad and both side salads were pathetically put together with NO salad representation other then lettuce and 2 olives....That is not a salad of any caliber whatsoever. Chicken Parmigiana..TERRIBLE quality chicken and breading. First time I have EVER experienced Chicken Parmigiana that is NOT served with pasta. Hmmm...ODD. Options were offered but pasta is not an included item with the dish. Chicken Alfredo. Watery thin sauce lack of any substance. WEAK to say the least. Chicken on the alfredo and Caesar salad had a strong lemon flavor. Again Odd.

OVERALL: UGGH It has sunk to worse then Olive Garden.Lunch from Hell.  A colleague of mine and I decided to have lunch there yesterday.  It was dead.  They seated us.  After about 15 minutes and no one taking an order, I started looking around and caught the girl's eye who sat us.  She asked if anyone had been to our table yet.   She immediately got someone to take our order.  When our waitress came back with our drinks and appetizer, she then proceeded to dump the entire tray in my lap!  After I cleaned myself up, she moved us to another table.  She replaced our drinks and brought out another appetizer.  When I flipped that napkins over that she brought with our app, I see tomato sauce smudges on them.  The entrees arrived without risk to life and limb.  when she brought the bill (yes, she gave us a bill), she mentioned that she took the appetizer off the bill.  

I never saw a manager.  The entire meal should have been taken care of.  This has to be the worst restaurant experience I've had in the entire Madison area.Food isnt that great, all you can eat sushi?? Sound good but the fish/meat was cut so thin that you can see through it.  Servers bad attitude & bad manner if u did not eat the rice (sushi rice)  this is not a all u can eat!!!  its more like all you have to eat!!!We made a trip to the Auld Dubliner after the movies a couple of weeks ago.  We arrived about 10 pm and the place was crowded.  They had a live band and it was so loud that I couldnt hear anything!  We sat down and ordered drinks and waited about ten minutes for them.  After that we ordered off the limited late menu and I had the Corned Beef Sandwich and it was one of the worst meals I have ever had.  The texture and flavor were horrible.  My wife had wings and was not impressed.  The prices were very high for what you received. 

 We will not be making a return trip here.HUGE customer service fail today. I called ahead and made an appt for a mani/pedi. I showed up 10 min early and signed in, also indicating a mani/pedi would be desired. The girl who gave me the pedicure left for the day after painting my toes. They had me wait 30 min. All the while people walking in and getting in line. They then asked me to pay. I explained I had an appt for both and he claimed I didn't. I also explained that when I arrived 2 hours before their closing I marked I wanted both. Not even an apology. They let the people who walked in an HOUR after me stay.  I can't believe they didn't even apologize if it was truly a misunderstanding. Also, if you have us check off a list what we want? READ IT. There are 8 other nail places within blocks. You don't have a monopoly on the market. Customer service goes far.Let me preface the following review by saying that if I didn't absolutely have a terrible experience, I wouldn't have said anything.  This review is also concerning their window ONLY.  I really wanted to go to their restaurant the next time we go to New York, but if this window is a representation of Serendipity 3's brand and values, I am NEVER eating their food again. 

Our experience at the window was THAT bad!

We were only in Las Vegas for one day and wanted to do all the fun stuff instead of gambling.  I had always wanted to go to Serendipity 3 but we just never got around to it during other trips so we decided to try it.  I was really, REALLY excited about the frozen hot chocolate because I had heard about it so many times from people like Whoopie Goldberg, Jessica Simpson and of course from the movie Serendipity.

Here is my warning to you, head it if you will: DO NOT ORDER FROM THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT TO GET A GOOD EXPERIENCE!!  I say this after an hour of waiting in their line for below average food.  There was a long wait for the restaurant so silly us thought the window would be faster.  We stood in that line for an HOUR and then once we ordered our food, it took us 20 minutes to actually get a very simple order, which was a chili cheese hot dog, fries and 2 frozen hot chocolates.  Apparently, there was only 2 people working the window for a line of about 50 people.  One girl, who I actually need to commend for keeping her cool.  She was very nice and it didn't seem like the pressure was stressing her out.  The cook on the other hand, was a complete jerk.  It seemed like he was just hanging out back there, not concerned about the line or even caring that people get their food in a timely manner.  He even took off for 20 minutes which is why it took our food so long to actually get to us.  When he came back, he took a sip of his drink and ate some chili, COMPLETELY unconcerned that he had a job to do and maybe needed to do it quite urgently.  Perhaps these are the wrong employees to be working this window.  I suggest getting maybe 4 people who have a deep sense of urgency.  These two lackluster employees are not going to cut it.  I could hear people crumbling behind us about how long the wait was and why were simple orders taking so long.  I felt inclined to get out of the line a few times and didn't because of what I thought I was getting, which was SUPPOSED to be an amazing meal and the rumored delicious frozen hot chocolate.

This did not happen.  The food arrived to us cold.  This is because nothing is fresh in this poor excuse for a kitchen.  Everything is just sitting there.  The chili was cold (and too sweet by the way,) the cheese was half frozen and not melted, which means the chili wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese, the wiener was overcooked but cold on the inside and the bun wasn't toasted, the fries were soggy and cold, and the frozen hot chocolates, ohhh.....

The frozen hot chocolates were a HUGE disappointment!  The drink itself was pre-made and had been sitting on the counters the whole time we were in line because I could see inside the window.  The whipped cream was good and I guess the drink tasted ok but it was warm because it had been sitting there and it was melted.  The actual idea of the "frozen hot chocolate" is just ridiculous.  It's basically a glorified shake.  I THOUGHT it was hot chocolate with a scoop of ice cream in it! THAT would have been MUCH better!  Instead, I got a watered down shake I could have gotten at Baskin Robbins.  I don't really like Baskin Robbins but in this case, it would have been WAY better than what we were served.  It would have been fresh too.

The prices are also really outrageous.  $12 for a glorified shake?!?!  After an hour and 20 minutes, we were able to sit down.  The food was completely inedible.  My husband, who normally keeps his cool and tells me to let things go, was outraged.  This coming from a guy who will eat ANYTHING!  We discussed how we would handle this and the possible ramifications and decided that we NEEDED to say something. 

I went to the restaurant and asked for the manager and saw that the inside of the restaurant was WAY better than the window.  It was like a completely different restaurant.  The manager came out and was really helpful.  I told her of our experience and dissatisfaction and let her know that I normally wouldn't ask for a refund because it's more about letting them know so they can improve but our experience was so negative that I was demanding a refund at this point.  She was very nice and said she completely agreed and rushed to get me a refund.  That made the situation slightly better and I appreciate that there are at least people in the main restaurant that know what good customer service is.

I am really sad that this experience has tainted my want to try this restaurant again.  Even if I go to New York.  Stay away from the window in Las Vegas and I am sure that their food is actually good.Wow this place is over-hyped!!! Should have gone to max brenner!! $12 for a mediocre chocolate shake! Honestly, it was nothing special at all!

The only thing that was good was the Sundae with a chocolate cake in it.
Also the software they use to seat you is nice. And the wait was shorter than what they had said.Save yourself the terrible service, overpriced food, and awful experience, and go somewhere else. Definitely not worth it, especially if there is a wait. 

After waiting nearly an hour to get our food after we placed our order, our food came out. I would have been willing to give this place 2 or 3 stars if the food was at least half decent, but it wasn't. Our burgers were extremely dry, the chicken satay wraps were tasteless and cold, and my sister's fries were dry and stale. I was hoping that after the long wait, at least our food would be good, but it seemed like it had just been sitting out forever. 

Frozen Hot Chocolate: 
My best advice would be to skip their frozen hot chocolate and instead, go to Godiva and get their frozen Dark Chocolate Decadence shake. It tastes better and costs less than half the price. We got the frozen hot chocolate to go because we wanted to get out of the place. The frozen hot chocolate is good, but definitely not worth $11. Each of us took a few sips and that was all we needed before throwing it away. And trust me, it was not because we were full. 

This was the closest I have ever come to walking out of a restaurant. Our server, Robert or something like that, was probably one of the worst servers I have ever had. My entire family works or has worked in the restaurant/service industry so we usually give servers the benefit of the doubt, but this guy was unacceptable even to our standards. He gave us a bunch of attitude and was not attentive at all. At one point, it was taking so long for our food to come out that my mom asked him to cancel our order. But he told us, "Oh, but it's right there, I can see it". I had a direct view of the kitchen and there was nothing on the counter... but we decided to be nice and say ok. Fast forward 15 minutes later... still no food. He intentionally avoided our table during that entire time and was not apologetic at all. I think he may have said sorry once but it was the least genuine and most condescending "sorry" I have ever heard. 

To end on a happy note, the decor is really cute. Reminds me of an old school ice cream shop.must be out of business.  The number is disconnected.  bummer.  I need a gardener.Went to bacon for breakfast on 02/28 and man I should have stayed in bed. This place has no business being open, why? Because of the following: 1) this is just another "trendy" restaurant  that is run by people who want to make money...and NOT provide go food and
 service that exceeds the customers expectations. 2) incompetent management and waitstaff who where not full of smiles but rather full of excuses as to why our damn food had not arrived in an hour after waiting a half an hour for a table.  3) if you think that the food here is worth waiting for...then you are glutten for punishment.  Denny's is better than bacon. I mean when I 
looked at my food as it arrived an hour later... My first thought was man I wish I was going through McDonald's drive thru for a sausage mcmuffin it made my mouth water. Instead, I had to deal with what was thrown on my hurried plate a few cold eggs with bone dry bacon and where was the damn toast I ordered!!!!! I mean this is not a free meal !!!! (though it should be) because it was free of any taste, imagination, or flavor.  4) instead of taking responsibility for their mismanagement the managers and servers think that customers want to hear excuses like "we didn't expect it to be this busy" or "the kitchen is a bit overwhelmed" WHAT!! That is YOUR problem BACON!!!  Paying customers just want to have their food as promised. If you can't deliver on that then get the he'll out of the restaurant business.  Food is not a child's game....you can't screw with peoples appetites and then be flippant about it and not expect us to respond with an ear full.  I could go on and on, however, anyone considering this place at anytime be warned read these reviews, I wish that I had and I would not have gone to this faux eatery which is a step below Cracker Barrel.  Bacon owners if you read this my gut and eyes tell me that your Restaurant is on borrowed time and won't last another six months. Once people are onto your business model which is poor service and tasteless food at a kings ransom in this economy...the only thing in Bacon's future is foreclosure where it belongs. My hope and desire is that when you people shut done your empty Restaurant and are left standing and scratching your heads....that you will take a moment to reflect on your service failure and then watch how McDonald's who will by now have taken over your location gets food out in a timely manner.   Bacon your days are numbered and you cook staff sucks...college kids with tat's and piercings....not in my food and certainly not on my dollar. Take a pass on this place truly not worth it they specialize in bad food and bad excuses and not much else.  Zero stars would be generous here.A gift shop in the bar? I am not the too cool for school type but really? Cheesy atmosphere, chain, bad service and gift shop.  Sorry in this case 4 strikes you are out.I absolutely abhor this place. The service is the worse I've ever seen. They have a niche clientele that maybe think the trashy waitresses and freedom fries are cool but I feel highly uncomfortable here and wish I never knew it existed and the food is chilies equivalent.Tried their bubble Tea but was not impressed. If you want Authentic bubble tea I'd say head over to Jade Mountain. They know how to make Bubble Tea Taiwanese style.Horrible horrible service. We had reservations there advance of two weeks. We requested that the food be ready by the time we get there (which was 7p.m.). NOTHING was cooked... nothing was ready. We only got to eat 2-3 out of the 7-10 items ordered. Food was ok, but the service was so bad that I will not be returning any time soon.I've been receiving West Elm catalogs since well before there was an actual retail location here in AZ, and I absolutely love the style and beauty of many of their items. 

That said, I was thrilled to see the Scottsdale Quarter location would be so close to my office! I've shopped at this location multiple times with average to subpar experiences each time.

The actual store is bright, modern, and lovely albeit a bit small considering that it is a furniture showroom. I enjoy their knick knack section, which seems to rotate regularly, and I also love their linens. 

The true problem is the staff in this store. 

I shopped at the store during Christmas - I had seen a beautiful jewelry tree that I was interested in purchasing and asked a nearby employee if there were any that were already boxed up. She uninterestedly asked me which one I was talking about (which was the one immediately in front of us) She gestured towards the back wall of the store and I noticed that there was a larger version of it on the opposite side of a display (which cost 3x as much)- perfect! I headed over to take a closer look and when I turned to ask another question of the employee, she was long gone. I finally decided to buy two gifts - one small and one large jewelry tree, and then headed to the front of the store with my purchases. I once again asked the girl at the cash-wrap whether they had a box for the gifts, as I was planning to ship them. Mind you, the entire store was littered with displays of gift boxes of all sizes as they were touting the special West Elm boxes as perfect packaging for your Christmas gifts. The employee helping me scrunched up her face and tried to say that they didn't have many left and she couldn't give me one. I pressed further and she reluctantly walked over to the nearest display to see if any of those boxes would work. After awhile, she could not find a gift box that was appropriate and I explained again that I needed to ship the gift and would REALLY like a box. At my insistence, she went and found a box in the back to pack the larger tree into so that I could ship it to my sister. This should not have been quite so difficult and I was left feeling unvalued as a customer. 

This past week, I returned to West Elm in search of a picture frame. I found what I was looking for on the back wall of the store - the gallery frames, which were coincidentally on sale. I searched amongst the stacks of frames for the correct size and had no luck, so I spotted an employee a few feet away in the next section and popped over to ask for her help - I wanted to know if perhaps they had my size in the back of the store since I could not find it myself. She seemed unhappy with my question and stalked over to the shelves of frames to look for herself. She condescendingly discussed my request with someone over her headset as though it was the most difficult thing in the world and after several minutes of this I finally said that if it was too inconvenient I could just take the next size up. The woman huffed disgustedly at me, spun on her heel, and walked over to another employee to start a conversation with no further offer of help...

When I went up to the cash wrap, it was deserted. I searched around for an employee for a minute and thought I heard someone through the doorway to the stockroom. I called for them and eventually a gentleman appeared. He asked what I needed and I told him I needed to check out. While he was helping me with my purchase, he asked if anyone had assisted me. I mentioned that I didn't know her name, but referenced the rude behavior of the employee who was back by the frames and he sarcastically said "oh, the rude one, well that narrows it down for me" before continuing to check me out. No apology or further inquiry ... nothing. 

Now, he was quite nice and seemed to be trying to subtly recover my business, but unfortunately didn't seem to understand a key part of customer service which is to address and apologize for any inconvenience ... and his kindness was just not enough to fix it. 

I don't plan to return to this store, and although I love and recommend their products, I am hesitant to continue purchasing products from their company altogether, even through their catalog. I am completely surprised as I have never experienced anything but great service in their other brand-stores (Pottery Barn, Williams Sonoma, Restoration Hardware)Horrible food. The fish was extremely oily, as well as the fries. Never going back. The food was tasteless and dry.Forget the size of the pool. Don't even worry a out the cost of the drinks.

Customer service here is some of the worst I've ever experienced.

EXAMPLE:

Me - "Excuse me miss, do you want to close your [thing that holds the cherries, lime, other fruit]? Those bees are all over the fruit."

Girl working behind the bar - "Yeah, we have bees everywhere."

Guy working with girl behind the bar - "As long as we don't get the bees in your drink right?"

WRONG.  And now you have a bad review on Yelp.This restaurant was recommended by a friend yesterday for their happy hour and fish tacos.  One of the most expensive happy hours I have ever attended in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and I have lived here 10 years!!  The house martini was $8.00 for happy hour, Svedka, and you can buy a big bottle at Total Wine for 16.99----wine was about $8.00/glass happy hour price--geez---go to Morton's. Fleming's--anywhere, my fish taco was fine for $3.00, although the bartender told me it would be salmon, it was some type of white fish, Bill ordered the shrimp taco---blackened, so very salty, we could not eat it!!!  The fries were also very spicey and you could only eat the top layer so as not to get all the spice.  All in all one of the very worst dining/happy hour experiences we have had in the 10 years we have lived here.  Do the owners have any idea of their competition and the market out there?!!  I would suggest do not even try this place!Awful service and extremely slow. Go elsewhere.I should of never came here. Ruined my Vegas trip.

I went here because the reviews on Yelp were pretty high, now I feel like it was all bs reviews.

I went in at the beginning of my week long trip and just wanted a #2 fade. Plain and simple.
The male stylist said ok so I thought, cool no problem.
He started and ended up cutting my hair crooked and too much off the top. Like a military buzz cut but with the top longer so made my head look like a bent pineapple with an asian mullet. I mean..wtf..seriously?? I've done a better job cutting it myself without mirrors...LITERALLY.
And THEN after all that bs..he tells me its $25..REALLY??

I didnt want to deal with his bs anymore or even see if he can fix it, not the kind of gamble I was hoping to do in Vegas.
I actually went down the street to a barber shop and paid more to get it fixed. They did a better job fixing the stupid ass haircut than this "stylist" trying it in the first place. AND it was $10 cheaper!
I cant understand how someone that cuts hair cant do a simple fade. Truely a disappointing experience.

If you still want to spend your money here..take that cash, go on the strip and give it to one of those homeless people on the bridges. It'll be put to better use, whether food OR drugs~Please, don't bother getting out of your truck and PLACING my Amazon package next to the front door or concerning yourself with the fact that ANYONE could have seen it and taken it, since it was LYING IN THE MIDDLE OF MY FRONT LAWN! Obviously you just threw it curbside from the truck while sitting on your ass. Apparently you've done your job. Good Job, idiots.ruined a very expensive dress and when  had to reimburse me for it...pushed back. This was in in DC Ranch. DO NOT USE IN MY OPINION.I visited a few days ago and I had high expectations. I ordered some common Korean fare and it smelled good. However there were so many fruit flies everywhere and they crawled over everything; there were hundreds of them. I finished my soup and boxed up everything and went home. I can't judge the food because the images of those flies are my first impressions of this restaurant.
I didn't have any food poisoning so I'll be back to try again; I hope the flies are a one time thing.I wouldn't recommend this place, paid 25 for a pedicure, lamest one I've ever received, top coat and base coat didn't cover the whole nail and was raised at cuticle the next next day. The chairs are not comfortableDO NOT GO!

At my first and only visit, I was so turned off that I left in the middle of treatment. First I had to wait over 20 minutes to be seen after be asked to come in early in which I left work early to do so. That was a first red flag. Then Dr. Baca came in and went right into a treatment plan that consisted of MUI treatment that my insurance did not cover. He went on and on without ever taking the time to really ask good questions or introduce himself. I actually stopped him and asked what his name was. All I could hear was a well practiced sales pitch and a lot of $ required of me. After this talk, I went on to receive some heat treatment that came with no explanation of why I needed it and I was never asked if I wanted it. As I was laying there thinking how "off putting and expensive" this experience has been thus far, I actually looked up their reviews online (Yes, should have done that before) and found that my feelings were confirmed by past patients experiences. I actually took the little straps off of me and left. 

Just recently, I started therapy at a new practice that required Dr. Baca to sign off on a referral form. You would think this would be easy. It actually took me 5 days, 10 phone calls to get to talk to anyone that was competent enough to do this all to be disappointed that the referral was never faxed over to my new Dr. I actually went to Dr. Baca's office and sat there until they wrote the referral. 

very sketchy and unprofessional office.Don't come here during graveyard the last two times we came here we got the worse service. Two bartenders and not one will come up to us. One was talking to girls for over a hour and other guy didnt come to West side of the bar. I'm a bartender and I would be ashamed if I gave a customer this kinda service. We will never step foot inside Road Runner on W. Flamingo Rd ever again. Thank you..I am going to keep this short and not so sweet.
First there wasn't 5 guys, there was 3 guys and a girl.  Ok my attempt at humor might have failed but so did this place in my book.
I spent 15 dollars on 2 burgers and 1 regular fry, way to much if you ask me.  
They screwed up my order, twice.
The first time I ordered a bacon burger with cheese all the free toppings minus the mushrooms, they put mushrooms on.  I sent it back and also asked them to leave off the gross, processed slop that they were trying to pass off as cheese. Also the first burger was a sloppy, soggy mess from the moment I opened the foil that it was wrapped in.
When I went back to the counter I went over my order, slowly, thinking it would be right.  Since everyone had already eaten I took it to go without checking it, another mistake on my part.  They left off the mushrooms this time but forgot the bacon.  You think they would have given my burger special attention since they screwed it up the first time, nope.
I try to stay away from chain restaurants anyway, give my money to locally owned establishments, and this experience has solidified that notion.  I will stick with Lobby's thank you.I brought a group of six people (we're in our 30's & 40's) in on St. Patty's day 2013 @ 8pm for dinner. We wanted a mellow evening and weren't out partying. It was a gorgeous evening and half of our party was visiting from out of town and wanted to sit on the patio. We walked outside and looked around to see if there was any place to sit. The patio was full, but the entire inside was empty. When we went back inside. The bartender started questioning us if we'd been drinking? And began hassling us because my two male cousins were hugging and hanging on each other. They weren't making out, they just hadn't seen each other in three years and they were being silly. No one was stumbling, falling down, being obnoxious, we'd only had a cocktail at Citizen's Public house before walking over to 5th & Wine. Seemed like the bartender was over cautious because of the day. We decided to leave and drove over to AZ 88. Yes drove, in Scottsdale, on St. Patty's day. We weren't intoxicated. Just happy to be with our family. 

I understand the need to be concerned about over-serving on one of the busiest drinking days, but come on.

Needless to say I won't be going or suggesting this place.Only 3 customers in the establishment, 30 minutes wait after we ordered. Grilled cheese sandwich was burned. Fries were over cooked. Will not be coming back. The cook was horribleI've eaten here three times. #1 there were 3 tables of people. My pizza took 45 minutes and was served burned to a crisp.  #2 there were 4 or 5 tables and the service was almost as slow as the firs time. #3 I went for the lunch buffet. It was ok at best. I won't be going again unless someone else is paying.Bottom line:
DON'T GO HERE. RACIST BARTENDER!!!

Worst bar I've ever been to. They lure you in with a promise of free drinks all night for $20 but leave out that "free drinks" don't apply to shots, premium liquor cocktails or anything else worth drinking, really. 

Service was amazing. AMAZINGLY HORRIBLE. I don't know how this place manages to stay in business with such idiot bartenders who openly admit to using margarita mix to make their cocktails. The bartender (female, fake boobs, huge nose,  horrible highlights, bad attitude) serving us was condescending and rude saying, "who makes margaritas with simple syrup?" Umm real bartenders do, stupid. Then she had the audacity to ask for a tip. Here's a tip, quit your job because you're a total failure as a bartender. THEN she turns to another bartender and says, "that's why I don't serve Asians." Seriously bitch?? First off I'm not Asian, and second, what does my race have to do with your inability to make a drink correctly? 

Complete waste of time and money! Hope that bartender gets fired.I've been eating pizza my whole life. I'm Italian from NY, and have spent time in Chicago. So I know what Chicago pizza is supposed to be.... Not this. Not at all. 

Anyone on here that thinks otherwise... Well, that's what opinions are for I suppose.I knew the was not going to be good when the egg rolls were pink in the inside.  Who makes pink egg rolls.  Then, the Chicken Egg Foo Young was plain and the gravy (which looked like country gravy served with biscuits) were on a different bowl. I didn't want smothered chicken, I wanted egg foo young. The chow mien (Lo Mein) was average as well as the shrimp fried rice. It was no better than a food court Chinese food place. It was edible, but no one in our family fought over the food. We left our food and didn't even take our left overs.  $28 down the drain. My husband said, " I was extremely disappointed.  The plates were so small, all of the food couldn't fit on the plate. The table was sticky." My daughter said, "Even the Fortune Cookie was nasty."  I joked and said, "My fortune cookie said "Next time eat at Taco Bell..  I hope this food doesn't come back to haunt me in the middle of the night.  It's just a strip mall Chinese food place.As a second time returning customer,  I couldn't have been more disappointed. The ticket times for both food and beverage were ridiculous. The server was in the weeds, due to the hostesses over-seating his section. The bussers wandered around aimlessly, while the m.o.d was careless and non-existent. My ticket, table for 2, entrees were delivered 20 minutes apart. The operation of this establishment is sloppy and embarrassing.If you ever get text message alerts from tropical smoothie, do not expect to redeem any sort of offer here. Every time I come in here there is always some reason why they can't accept it and it seems like the owners are just extremely cheap.Really not impressed with the staff here. We have come her for years to get propane, and the other day my tire was flat. I went in to get change for the machine (all the mechanics were standing around doing nothing) and NOT ONE offered to help. I am normally not a helpless woman. But let me add...I have a broken ankle. 
So much for SERVICE at Taylor'sPasses itself off as a French Bistro.  Well, at least  the bread was good.  Escargot was ok, though more like something they buy pre-prepared (no shells).  Crepes were awful and were obviously microwaved.  We're not that picky, but micowaved crepes??!!!  Service was decent until it got a little busier (why it gets busy I don't know) when our waiter seemed to forget about us.  At least they have Kronenborg but that's not enough for us to ever consider going backI was a new patient here this past week. By far the worst Dr's appointment I have EVER experienced. The Dr. I saw, MollyAnne- was so cold, unpersonable and rude.   
I thought I was getting a physical- but all that was checked were my lungs, and she listened to my heart. 
Without going into detail, she offended me, and I felt like an idiot the whole time I was there. I couldn't get out of that office fast enough.Do not use this company.  I own an electrical company and have been trying to collect payment for work we have done with this company month ago.  We have sent multiple email's and call to try to collect and have still not been paid in full.  BE AWARE!!!First and last time in this store this afternoon.   The clerk behind the counter complained about the customer who left as I was coming in and then proceeded to lecture me about my desired supplements.  She lost over $150 sale today and many more in the future as this store is on my way home but I will go out of my way for better customer service.Does pizza hut differ from the midwest??? We ordered from this place one night and were so disgusted by what we had that we will never order again... 


hungry howies is better if you can believe thatDon't even bother.

I am an avid Yelper and I should have checked the reviews on the various companies at the airport. 

 I booked a car online for 5 days.  i am a local and needed it until I could fly out to meet my family (they drove out of state with my vehicle for a trip).  I got an awesome rate online and we had to drop off my girlfriend's rental at the airport so it was convenient.  It was later in the evening and they only had one person working.  It took forever to get to the counter because that guy was trying to upsell the people in front of me on everything.  Finally another person came to the counter to help with the growing line.

So apparently you need proof of insurance and a utility bill if you are a local renter.  Are you kidding me?  I have never had a rental car agency require that.  It wouldn't have even been a big deal if it had been mentioned with the confirmation that I received in my email.  The rep made some excuse that it was because I booked with Orbitz and that the policy was in the terms and conditions.  When was the last time anyone read everything in the terms and conditions?  None of the other agencies have this rule so if it separates you from the others you should damn well make sure it is communicated to the customer beforehand.  So there i was with no way to get home to even get it and they rep didn't even try to see if an exception could be made.  

Needless to say I went over to the agency where we had turned in my girlfriend's rental and received much better service without a reservation and they were fantastic.  Yes, I paid a little more than I had anticipated but it works for me if the agency has my best interest in mind.  

So don't even bother dealing with Payless.  I was lucky enough to not get to the part where they try to sell you everything under the sun.  Your money is better spent elsewhere.Visited this store on Monday afternoon and had to wait 15 minutes before speaking with an employee. I had several questions regarding my current phone which hasn't worked well in months in spite of several contacts with Verizon tech support. The young man I spoke with essentially told me it was my fault because I had purchased a bad phone. He seemed oblivious to his own implication that Verizon sells junk. I also asked him why I should stay with Verizon given the poor service I have received. He said the only reason to stay is their great customer service. 

He couldn't have been less interested in helping a customer so I didn't stay a customer. Do yourself a favor and visit the cell phone center in Target or Sam's or anywhere but this store.I took two old photos to have copies made.  One would think photos would be put on photo paper, not something that would be considered flimsy typing paper. Since we are visiting here, I didn't have the time to go back and have this done correctly. Don't bother to go there to have photos copied, since the person I talked to on the phone couldn't grasp the meaning of photo paper.Never Again... Store bought frozen food heated up. Poor service, dirty, loud, took forever. The entire night was ruined by this experience. Was so excited to try this place too! We came in with friends laughing...left very sad and disappointed. Sorry, but this place was really that bad, and pricey for the junk they served too. I have no idea how anyone could rate this place any higher than a 2 star???!!! ...maybe weighted by friends of the owners?We live nearby and thought it would be great to try a local dental office.  Both times my husband and I went in the dental hygienist talked, and talked, and talked to the point of annoyance.  Also, the dentist informed my husband that he needed a considerable amount of work done.  We waited a year (finances!) and went back to our prior dentist - listed in the Phoenix Magazine's "Top Docs" - only to find that NO WORK was necessary or even recommended.I think I did something bad in my previous life that I went to this place. This place is a SCAM. they will LIE AND RIP YOU OFF. never go to this place. They use scare tactics to rip off the money for the work that is not needed. 
Please find a real dentist.To whom it may concern;
My wife went into the supersar car wash on dysart and van buren. The attendant at the front tried to upsell my wife to get the interior cleaned. he said there were some scuffs on the seats. she said she would just have someone wipe off the seat with a rag because that is all it needed. He wrote on the window of the vehicle "do not touch the inside" so they would not do as my wife asked. It seems to be very petty to do something like that. she was even willing to borrow a rag and wipe it down herself. When she went inside to discuss it with the manager, he gave her $7 off. It was kind of a slap in the face being that we have been going there for a long time and have spent quite a bit of money there. I can promise that something so menial will definitely keep me away from there. I would even drive much further away just to avoid them. Little things in the world make a difference. I guess I am old fashioned.this was the second gel manicure at this salon, my nails were filed down to mush, even with the gel polish on them they bend like crazy, both thumbnails broke the next day, won't go backMassage was amazing..... I was happy after the massage then walked up to the front to pay, not only the guy charged my 90 min / $45 wrong, I was forced to pay the tip between $12-17 dollars.  He charged my card $46, I don't know if it was by mistake or not, but to be forced to pay 30% tip was not a pleasant feeling after my massage. I will not recommend this place.  Tip amount should be up to the customer based on the quality of the service (10-15% is reasonable) not a mandatory 30% + percentage by the store.Boo! Not a fan of the food at all. Customer service was good & prices were ok.I read your comment Jeff. I have used many movers just not in this area. I lived in FL previously, so I couldn't use those movers again because they're located in FL. I did tell you about the damaged couch and you laughed at me and told me there was nothing you could or would do about it. You also refused to wrap the mattress or anything else (I asked to have everything wrapped with my own wrapping materials) but you told me that made the move more difficult for you guys and that if I wanted to use your service, nothing could be wrapped. Crappy service, crappy attitude, crappy movers. The fact that you don't care about a bad review says a lot.As others have said, it was pure evil, and not in a good way.  Came here on my 30th birthday because of the Vegas Power Pass.  As someone in the service industry, I might try a little harder (or at all?) to make a person's special day special.  Or at least to not ruin it.  This apparently completely missed the PH staff, who delivered the same lackluster (at best) service that they provide every other paying customer (who needs them, right?).  The wait was atrocious (seriously- for a tip, I almost felt like writing "You owe me 2 hours of my 30th birthday back), the drinks stayed empty (after they finally showed up, that is), and most of the food, once it did arrive, was wrong.  1/4 got his food correct, 2/4 got her vegetarian dish with meat, 3/4 (that would be me) got my salad with the wrong dressing, even though the waitress wrote down my request, and when I got the new salad, it wasn't tossed.  When I pointed this out, the waitress told me with quite a bit of attitude, "You asked for it dry."  Um, no I didn't, I just asked for bleu cheese instead of shitty thousand island on a COBB salad (oh wait, it's not a cobb because even though it was like $15, there was no avocado!).  Anyway, 4/4 didn't even receive his burrito until like 7 minutes later.  Really.  The food was actually pretty tasty, which was the only redeeming point of the entire experience.  Paying was another hour of my life lost, as the waitress didn't ring our payment correctly and then had to find a manager to reverse the charge on my credit card.  I seriously considered just leaving the card and deactivating it (I have another).  She came out just before we completely left in anger.  It really did take over 2 hours to have lunch for 4 people.  It really wasn't worth the time it stole from my life.  The next day, we forfeited the $10 PH credit on our passes.  No tip was left by anyone in our party.  As far as I'm concerned, they're lucky we paid at all.  Don't waste your precious vacation time.

On a side note: the bathroom also sucks.  Two stalls?  Really??Wish I could give this place more stars, but I checked out this morning, got to the airport and realized I had left my watch in the room.   Called the front desk to have them grab it and they transferred me to... lost and found?  Not a good sign.  If I were still in the hotel, I would just go up to the room myself and put the watch back on.  If it wasn't there, it would be stolen, not lost.   In any case, after multiple attempts at getting someone to bother to go up to the room and being told (by Jim in security?) they were "really busy", they finally called me back several HOURS later to inform me that the watch was not in the room.  What a surprise.  FAIL.room service very poor... i had cigars on my terrace from the last costumers every day i was there...
plus dust all over....
not what we expected at all....I ordered a pizza at 12:00 am when the pizza still hadn't showed up at1:30am I called and all the lady could say is, I don't know he should be there soon. I was shocked with tHe response and then went to bed hungry. Then I got a knock at the door at 2am and there he stood a pizza delivery driver with a nice cold, 
Cold pizza that looked like it had Been warm, but hours ago. The service of the lady on the phone was f?) $3@... and the 90 year-old man delivering the food must not have had a car but a peddle bike.wow never again. . Thanks for the frozen pie. ....I reserved a car from them because of their incredibly low prices.  And, it's true - you get what you pay for.  Absolutely horrible experience all-around.  I definitely will not be using them again.  I'd get into details, but it would just get me angry again and I don't want another bad day because of these guys.  Trust the reviews here.  They're all correct.  Stay away at all costs.I'm gonna change my previous review.

I wouldn't recommend anybody to do any business with this company.

I'm still trying to get my money back! I'm thinking about closing my credit card because they already charged me twice.

I call them and they just ignore me. I write them and they just ignore me.

It seems like this company is trying to make money charging their clients extra money and hoping that they'll just ignore it.

Have a look at Better Business Bureau:

You can also google something like "Fox Rent a car charged me again" or "Fox Rent a car did not return my security deposit" and you'll be surprised how many people had the same problem.Super greasy and very rare fajitas. Won't eat them and won't go back... it was chilis to go that i ordered online...  that "steak" that had the texture of a roast is going to get someone sick...I just gave these guys a call to see how much it would cost for my car to be done and ask a few questions about the process and the products. I was given the response "come in and we will talk" to answer every question i had. EXTREMELY frustrating and i will now not bring my car to them because of their inability to simply answer a few questions over the phone.I was taken here for a mother's day pedicure and although Tammy does my nails (which I love ) some other ladies did my daughter and my pedicure. They were not focused on what they were doing and didn't do a very good job! They were more concerned about there own language conversation. ...They didn't even polish all of the toe nail on my daughter's nail. .. I'm very disappointed....The woman behind the counter completely ruined what started out as a pleasant stop. I believe she was actually one of the owners as she said her husband is the one who puts out and prices things! Their prices were off but her blatantly bad attitude was what really killed it. 

We had time to kill so stopped in to hunt for vintage patterns. I was happily sorting through a tub of miscellaneous patterns and my boyfriend had found a set of 4 brass candlesticks ($4.75 per candlestick, not bad) when the woman came over to ask how we were doing. I said great but I thought her patterns were a bit overpriced. No, I did not say this in a confrontational or snotty way. I said it conversationally and added that they're 50 cents at Deseret Industries. Her response was and I quote "I don't care!" And then she stomped away. 

My point was simply this, most of the patterns were new, not vintage, in fact I had just bought one of the EXACT patterns that were in the bin days before for 99 cents during a sale at JoAnn Fabrics. I have spent upwards of $15 for vintage patterns that I love but there is no reason to spend $2 on dirty, already cut (possibly pieces missing) patterns that are currently available at half the price brand new. Thanks but I'll shop at thrift stores that appreciate my business or wait for the sales at JoAnns and save myself the nasty attitude and dirty looks! 

Epic Thrift is right down the way with a sweet lady as a greeter and waaaay more inventory. (No patterns, but hey, that's not what most of you are looking for anyway is it;)  

If you really want to treat yourself take a drive to Boulder City where there's an abundance of adorable little vintage shops with far better inventories, prices, and certainly infinitely superior attitudes! Do yourself a favor and skip 777 Thrift!This used to be our favorite Chinese restaurant in the area, but it seems it has been taken over by new ownership. The flavor is nowhere near what it used to be. The husband and wife who used to run the restaurant were very nice and we knew our food would be delicious every time. With the recent changes, they have lost the flavor and therefore, have lost us as customers.I wish I could give this place no stars if that we're an option. I called in to make an order and asked of I could do 2 separate transactions. She said "why you make this so difficult?". I decided not to eat from there. Can't give a review on their food. It can't be good quality with such bad service.Poor service, poor food
I've ordered food here 3 times from different cooks.  Each time it has been very bad.  Sauces are bland and even the last order of s Caesar salad was terrible.  The salad consisted of lettuce, just iceberg, a small chicken breast and ?caesar dressing?.  
Service has also been very bad each time I've tried this place.  Weak selection of drinks, and bartenders who either too bored or too distracted to look up.  Oh and the juke box will steal your money and play about half your songs.ZERO stars... I'm amazed that a transportation company refuses to obey not only traffic laws, but ADA laws as well. 

This morning I went to the post office on Sunset and witnessed cab #659 was parked in a handicapped space and also was blocking the access bays meant for those who need the extra room. When I asked the driver what he was doing, he played stupid. I told him to move but he refused.

I finally got fed up with the guy, so I called the dispatch line... They proceeded to hang up on me. Wow... What terrible people.

While I may be more sensitive than most people to this issue (I have a disabled daughter - HugsforHailey.com), I cannot understand the laziness and narcissism of people. 

Do not use Nellis Cab!Simple Pros & Cons:

Pros:
Good Location if you're close

Cons:
Extremely unprofessional and rude staff (3 of 3 times I went)
By appt were behind in schedule even in the morning - attendance?

Place was like mid 60s or below, people were staring at each other with fear when AC woudl turn on, while it's 100 outside. 

Without appointment I waited for over an hour then asked staff when might I be finally taken in approximately and was told, "I don't know", so I finally left. 

In Sum - Unless you want mental abuse from the staff, waste of time for the wait, and flu from other people and mid-low 60s freeze, go to the "normal" Summerlin Labcorp, if even a little drive more.DO NOT GO HERE!!!! Worst place I've ever been in Vegas... Service is terrible, food is terrible, overpriced and they false advertise prices on their own menu. The waitress tells me that prices have changed from opening... Ok? Than why do u still keep the menus? S#*t is retarded... To add insult to injury, our bill was 30 dollars, they charged us 86 and when we asked why, the waitress reluctantly said they had to charge us 10 per person for service... This is highway robbery. Patrons bewareFamily medicine is so awful, I cry every time I have to make an appointment.Worst company I have ever had the misfortune of having to deal with. A salesman told me internet would cost $30/month. They called back 2 days later to offer me internet for $45/month plus the cost of a router. Finally, a few hours later I was told it would be $50/month. I will never deal with century link for anything due to the incompetence of their employees.Came in and asked for a certain shoe in size 6 - 7 1/2. The girl working there today responded "We only have ADULT sizes". I have never been so insulted in my life.Absolutely ridiculous !! We stopped in after dinner and ordered a vanilla milkshake and 2 small blizzards.  After 30 mins and 5 orders after ours being filled ... We gave up and asked for a refund. The manager seemed to care less.  Horrible customer service.  I wish there was an option to select 0 starsWhat a fvcking racket Cox is.  If you just want basic cable Internet hook-up they use every trick in the book to get you to sign up for what sounds like a good deal, but once you are entrapped by their "introductory" promo they increase the price every 2 - 3 months till you are paying an exorbitant rate.  And forget about finding out exactly what that rate is; their website is designed to confuse you with different numbers and non-existent links. I have complained to both my Clark County commissioner and to the Nevada Public Utilities Commission but both just wrote me back with "Oh sorry schmuck that's not my responsibility". Of course, Cox has such enormous political pull that they can charge anything they want and the consumer can do jack shlt about it.  Be forewarned !I usually take my kids to get their cuts here and I've never had an issue. I decided to take my mother to get a trim here and checked in online as I always do, there was one person ahead of us, and she said we were next. A family of 4 came in after us and the lady at the counter asked them if they had checked in online, she replied no so she checked them in. The one person ahead of us was called and we saw on the screen that my mother was next. As soon as the next stylist became available we thought we were going to be called next, however she called the person after us. I approached her and brought it up and she told me they had checked in online and they were before us. It made me more upset that she thought I was that stupid to believe her, I clearly saw my mothers name next on the screen and heard her conversation. Because of this I will NOT be taking my kids here anymore.Food: we paid $3 more for the uni sushi and osyter shooter.  Keep in mind that each of us can only order ONCE for the uni and osyter.  The uni sushi only had "ONE PIECE" of uni on it that it barely can cover the rice.  Osyster shooters are in a small cup about the size of your finger.  The rolls and cooked food are okay.  All the sushi made with a THIN slice of raw fish and BIG piece of rice.  Couldnt even taste the fish at all when the rice is so big and fish are cut this thin!!! I know this is all-u-can eat, but quality like this is very unacceptable.  I'd rather pay a little bit more so I can have some REAL sushi!!!  

Service: Not so good service.  Average wait time for all the food to come is about 2-3 hours.  Bad bad bad service from the waitress.  Chiefs aint friendly either.  

I wish I can give a zero star to this sushi place.The hostess was very nice and invited us in to dine so we said OK lets try something new.  We went in sat down and started looking over the menu.  After a while we noticed that no one had checked on us and at least 2 songs had passed by.  I looked at my wife and we decided to play a game.  We put both our empty water glasses out for the server to see and we counted how many times someone would look at them before they came over to check on us.  Menus down and empty glasses out, servers glanced over our table 11 times before we decided to leave.  This place needs work.Terrible. Absolutely HORRID service from the moment we walked in. We are avid global travelers and usually Ritz Carlton or Intercontinental advocates but decided to take Mothers Day Easter brunch at the supposedly best place in Phoenix. 

The overpriced buffet is what we would expect, so expect that.  We arrived 5 minutes prior to our reservation time. No one offered a drink or flower to my wife.. or an other mothers that I could see. We finally were seated 10 minutes after our reservation time by the table next to the kitchen.

Our first waiter came to us and wasn't really sure what drinks were available, and did not specify if any were included or not in the meal. He didn't suggest we were free to go enjoy any of the food so we waited. He came back a few minutes later saying someone new was now our waitress. So then we asked if we were able to partake in the tables of food around, and he said sure. His demeanor, body language and the fact he never looked us in the eye or told my wife Happy Mothers Day wasn't a good start.

The second person came with drinks. Now this was only a few hours ago we ate, so its pretty fresh in my mind, but she came to the table 5 times the whole meal. We repeatedly had to ask for silverware, empty plates stacked up on the table, a beer bottle was sitting there empty, and had to ask twice even for more water. 

Recall I said we were by the kitchen entrance so we were passed by numerous other staff all afternoon. We grabbed a couple other staff members at different times so we could get silverware to eat with. We enjoyed the food. A few good thinks to mention, however the tables were usually empty each time any of the three of us went to go eat and from our 2 hour visit there many of the items remained empty placeholders of crumbs and signs of the food that was there.

We heard waiters in the back complaining of their tips. Wow. They were VERY lucky I left them 10% and do not recall the last time in my life I ever left anything as little as that. So they are probably talking about us right now.  Well don't worry. I would never come back and highly advise anyone to go. 

The staff and more so management there needs to wake up. Go spend a day or eat at comparable places. Even the Flexprint Club we enjoy as season floor seat holders has amazing service and that isn't the destination point. Oh another side note, this place was so horrible, that I have only left one other Yelp review in my life.I would avoid this dealership at all costs. They tried to get me to claim something on my own insurance even though they delivered a car to me with cracks in the windshield. Now, I have called and complained to the Better Business Bureau and am still waiting to get my windshield replaced. Beware! There are other much better VW dealers around town.Located on the 5th floor of the Imperial Palace Hotel, Quesadilla looks like a mix between a Chili's and Acapulco except it has much lower quality food and lacks their own bar. They have to share with 2 other restaurants.

Food: 1/5 stars
The carne asada and carnitas meat were both dry and tasted like cardboard. The rice was bland and I think the only reason they added it to the plate was to take up room on the plate as well as your stomach if you can tolerate the taste.  If they're going to serve dry food, they should have the courtesy of giving us refills on our waters.

Service: 3/5 stars
Nothing spectacular. They weren't really friendly and didn't check on us.They'll fix your car, but they'll charge you more than other places and won't give you a quote until your car is in their shop. Also tried to upsell me on literally everything in my car including things I had replaced or fixed 6 months or a year ago (brake pads). Seems like a sketchy establishment, I'd look elsewhere.This is the second time we have tried this place, trying to give it a second chance.  NEVER AGAIN :-/  The food is bad and the service sucked :-(  I am actually normally nice and try to be nice in my comments but I have nothing positive to say about this place. The only positive is that I will never have to eat there again :-)I don't even know where to begin. Sat down, the table was full of other ppls drinks... our server told us weird things we didn't need to know.. the food came out wrong... and took forever...they didnt have things on the menu... marg machine wasnt working... was given the wrong bill... not a great experience. I hear if you come before 2pm it's better and they have happy hour mimosasI don't recommend going there.  My wife and I decided to go there for some dessert after a very nice dinner.  I wanted an "Apple Pie A la Cold Stone".  I have had this before and it is normally very good.  I was told that they had been out of the pie filling for a while.  Yet this is one of their "Signature Creations".  I would expect that if this is something that they always have that they would have on their menu, they would have the ingredients for it.  Then, My wife ordered their seasonal "Funnel Cake Sundae.  My wife ended up waiting 15 minutes for this.  Jacob and Chad told us that they had to reheat the Funnel cake for the sundae twice.  This made is rock hard and she had to throw most of the funnel cake away because she could not eat it.  As we were waiting, I noticed how dirty the entire interior was.  It looks like the floors and base boards have not cleaning in months.  Tables and floors were dirty and sticky-GROSS.  I did not check the bathrooms, too scared to try.  On top of all this, the price for their "Creations" is way too high!!!  I am tempted to call the health department for an inspection.  DON"T GO THERE!!!  it is a waste of time and money.Paisley moved locations (by about 100 yards), and on the new location was a mural beloved by the neighborhood and painted by an internationally-renowned Phoenician artist called El Mac who creates amazing and sometimes massive murals all over the world.

They painted over it.Placed a take-out order of vegetable pakoras, shahi paneer, garlic naan, and papadum. Did not receive the pakoras at all, the naan was COLD (not even lukewarm), the papadum was burned, and the shahi paneer was crappy. As your lawyer, I advise you to become a patron of any other indian place in the valley but this one.The ABSOLUTE worse experience I have ever had ordering flowers! I made an order to have flowers delivered to my wife's work on Valentine's day. I looked at the exotic flower arrangements that Cactus Flower Florists carried. And I found one I knew my wife would love. They were a "Birds of Paradise" arrangement, we have just moved from Hawaii to Arizona and I thought it would be a great choice. I ordered and purchased the flowers and made sure that they would be able to be delivered by Feb. 14th Valentine's day. Well the day finally comes and my wife never gets the arrangements and when I call the florist to inquiry about the delivery a female employee, who I am later told name is Laura, tells me that the date of delivery was for Feb. 15th, now if I did not see that the flowers would have been delivered on valentine's day why would I schedule it for the day after, it kind of defeats the purpose, I would have looked somewhere else or just picked some up myself. Anyway she goes on to tell me they will not make any more deliveries that day. So I end the call now expecting them to deliver the arrangement on the 15th. Again the 15th is here and still by 330 p.m. my wife still has not received the flowers. I again call and ask about the delivery, after being transferred 3 times was told that on their system was a note saying that they had called me twice and left two messages (I never gotten any calls by them) that they did not have the birds of paradise flower and needed to have it replaced, this note was said by them to have been put in the system on the day I ordered the flowers. So not only did they say they called which they did not, but when I actually called them and spoke to a represenative nothing was told to me about this, nothing was ever mentioned about not having the flowers I ordered. Frustrated at the whole ordeal wanted it to be done with I agreed to let them send another "exotic" arrangement in its place. What my wife received that day was as pitiful arrangement as I have ever seen, not worth the over hundred dollars I spent. I could have pulled weeds out of my yard that were nicer! 
So to some it all up CACTUS FLOWER FLORIST is a sham and you should not waste your money here!Ordered a bright, feminine bouquet with roses, Peruvian lilies, and daisies.  Received a sloppy, lopsided bouquet with no roses and no Peruvian lilies.  It looks like they took a mish-mash of leftover flowers, put it together and delivered it.  It was awful.Just don't eat here.  I didn't know that Heinz made salsa.  Just can't seem to find anything positive to say about this place.  This is a town with a plethora of Mexican Restaurants, so you would think that competition alone would have closed this place.  Just drive over to Sylvia's La Canasta.  Its close, and very good.Man what a mess! I found myself walking in circles trying to figure out where to start and where to end. Everything is out of order and the placement of new releases (movies and music) makes absolutely no sense. This store could use a training day in merchandising. The staff seem disengaged and not familiar with the product. Want to throw the staff for a loop, ask for a copy of LA VIE EN ROSE...had to repeat the title several times to two different people who could not figure out what I was asking for. Oh forget it! 
Sincerely,  Empty HandedWe came out on a Saturday night. We understand it is busy and there is going to be a wait. We checked in with our name, party of two, was told it was going to be about a 30 min wait, got our pager, and waited outside since the lobby/foyer was crowded. There were a few parties waiting outside too. 

40 minutes have passed, we came inside and checked to see the status of where our name was. Apparently our pager was dead, they called our name 10-15 minutes ago. We were put off by the manager/supervisor's attitude, he was really rude.  He made it seem like it was our fault we didn't hear our names called because we were standing right outside and that our pager was dead. I saw that they were calling names inside and outside, but the only called outside every other time. 

This kind customer service at the beginning set the mood for the evening...not fun. We always try to have a positive attitude, but it was kind of sad when someone that is representing the restaurant is not welcoming, we didn't really want to be there anymore. We stayed though because we are not rude. 

They did seat us about a minute after.

Our waiter was awkward too, but he tried. 

We always like to come out here to have our favorite appetizer and dessert. We live 30 min away, so we like to make night of it when we decide to come out.I purchased a pair similar to these. After about two years of gentile use, the thong on the left sandal fell apart. Since Dillards won't accept returns items this old and because it appears to be an obvious defect, I wrote to Cole Haan for a replacement. All they could offer me was a 30% discount off of my next purchase. Pretty poor customer service in my opinion. I really thought Cole Haan quality was superior and that stye would stand behind their products if something went wrong. Turns out I was wrong. Others need to consider this before paying a premium to purchase Cole Haan products.Unmitigated Disaster - We will never be back again, and I would have to recommend (after this experience) for no one to go there either.

Upon entering the restaurant, we were not so kindly greeted by a white haired woman at the front desk. Our reservation was for 7PM, and we got there at 6:55PM. The disgruntled lady tells us to sit in the lobby until it's closer to 7PM... Since when did showing up a few minutes early become a nuisance? Moving forward, we headed towards the lobby to find eight people also waiting to be seated. A little unusual for a Tuesday night, but no big deal - until twenty minutes passed until we were finally seated. I understand that restaurants can get busy, but a simple "I'm sorry for the wait" would have gone a long way.

There were two dining areas and we were placed in the larger room. Several tables were available, so I didn't understand the long wait. Anyway, there's an old-fashioned quality to this place... not good or bad. The chairs were uncomfortable and the carpet looked unkempt, but we were there for the food. 

We sampled the Duck Tamales.  Unfortunately, there was nothing special about this dish. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either.  That was the highlight of the evening

While waiting for the main dishes to arrive, it got extremely cold in the restaurant. We hear the staff complaining about the temperature, and then we see another couple complaining to the host about how cold it was on their side of the room. 

Finally, dinner arrives... I ordered the wild boar cooked to medium rare. It tasted medium-well to well done. The waiter stated that this dish comes with five large medallions, but looking at the dish, there were thinly shaved bits of meat. This dish reminded me of the over-cooked roast beef that my dad used to make when we were kids (which I hated, by the way). 

My wife ordered the braised short ribs which tasted like something that came out of a microwave. She tells me, "For the price of this meal, I'd rather eat a microwaveable meal." I tried a piece of the short ribs thinking it couldn't be that bad... WRONG. The short ribs were chewy, stringy, and although it was covered in sauce, it was DRY. We hardly put a dent in our meal. 

While waiting for our missing waiter, we noticed that the restaurant was starting to get really warm - similar to a gym. We both started laughing at how horrible everything had been. We were finally able to flag down the waiter for our check. He never once asked us how our meal was - even after seeing our plates were more than half full. 

Anyway, the moral of the story is: Don't waste your money here. Or perhaps call in advance to make sure Vincent is working. While waiting for our car, the valet guy said, "Vincent is on vacation. His food is phenomenal, but when he's not here, we hear customer complaints." Maybe this guy is right, and Vincent's food is out-of-this-world; however, based on the service alone, I will not even bother coming back. No second chances for this place - no thanks!Bean and cheese burrito was awful. The beans tasted like the canned beans you buy at the supermarket. 
Overpriced food.  Try Filiberto's instead. Some of them have daily specials running monday thru friday.WORST FOOD EVER!! 

I went there for their lunch specials and got the sweet and sour chicken. 

The egg roll was great, but the sweet and sour chicken was horrible. The sauce had no flavor and ruined my entire dish. Depending on your liking, the there were very thick peices of chicken within the dish with very little breading. I personal enjoy breading with my sweet and sour chicken.My issue is with Dr. O'sullivan. She's straightforward, no sugar coating, no emotion, no small talk, just strictly to the point. That's usually not my go to type of doctor but besides the personality factor I didn't have any other reason to switch at the time. 
I guess I should have gotten worried when she prescribed Zoloft for me because I was "depressed". I've never been treated for depression nor had any other doctor ever bring it up. I was young, unmarried, still in school and pregnant with horrible morning sickness. Would you be thrilled? I did not take the Zoloft, which now has a huge law suit for birth defects! She also wanted to give me zofran for my morning sickness which I refused to take as well. 
I went into labor at the hospital at 8pm and dilated until about 4 am that morning. Dr. O'sullivan didn't show up until almost 6am. My daughter sat in the birth canal so long that when she was born she was not breathing. My heart dropped when I didn't hear my baby crying. What did the doctor do? Nothing! Absolutely nothing. She stood there looking so confused. The nurses ran the baby over to the table and called a code. Other nurses literally ran in and revived my daughter getting her to breathe. Dr . O'sullivan did not even touch my daughter once while all that happened she just watched. If it wasnt for the amazing staff at good Sam my daughter would not be here or may have had long term effects. Even worse is that the same thing happened to my cousin. Dr O'sullivan was her OB and took a very long time to show up at the hospital as well. My cousin had already had two children so she knew the risks of waiting and told the hospital she's not waiting anymore so go get the doctor on staff. The dr at the hospital delivered her baby with no problems but just imagine if she had waited for Dr. O'sullivan to show up what could have happened.Entegrity...hmm...a play on words for Integrity?  I don't think so, not even close.  For this office, it's all about the almighty dollar. 
 
I have no issue with the mounds of paperwork I have to fill out each time I come in....but really, how many copies of my insurance card does your office need?  I don't even get upset when I have to sit for 20 minutes before and after I get taken back to see someone.  I'm a bit unnerved when the original issue I came in for is not addressed by the doctor and instead I am herded into other treatments.   I get a little frustrated when I have to jump through hoops to get a refill on my sublingual meds.  I get upset when I get charged a co-pay for a "check in" visit for the previously mentioned at-home self administered medication every 3 months.  I get angry when I am charged a $100 fee for rescheduling an appointment.  Had I been dishonest regarding my situation and kept the appointment instead of informing the office (who did not mention the fee during the reschedule), I would have only been charged my normal co-pay.   However, I get REALLY angry when I am condescended to by the staff.  I agree with the other reviewers regarding the staff being snippy, unaccommodating, argumentative and downright RUDE.   They will not listen to explanations, instead they will site "notes" that were written by their incompetent co-workers.  Entegrity, do you call all of your customers liars?

Bottom line....This office does not value its customers, only their wallets.  Take your business and hard earned cash somewhere else.  I know I will.I recently visited the David's Bridal Paradise Valley store while visiting my future in-laws after Christmas. My future mother-in-law really wanted to be involved in the dress shopping experience so I thought I would make my first shopping trip while visiting her. My future sister-in-law was in town too so I thought it would be a nice chance for her to be involved too. I didn't expect to find my dress as I am SUPER picky and it has taken me MONTHS to find dresses for things before. My wedding isn't until October, so I had 10 months and wasn't too worried. 

When I called to make the reservation for an appt at the Scottsdale store, I was diverted to the Paradise Valley store as the Scottsdale location was under renovation. Not a big deal as the PV store is only 20 min away. I had a terrible experience with Sierra at the PV store. They had warned me that the she would have another client, and I had informed my future mother-in-law and my aunt of this as well. It took her about 20 minutes to come greet me at the front of the store. I didn't try on my first dress until I was 45 minutes into the appointment. Sierra had pulled dresses for me but I was standing there in the slip and corset top they had me put on for 10 minutes before I gave up on waiting for her and had my aunt help me into the first dress. It was a Vera Wang I had been interested in, but I looked like a cream puff (not David's Bridal or Sierra's fault... just not a good look for me). I tried on only one of the other dresses Sierra had brought out of the 4 because I didn't like the dresses she pulled. I kept waiting for her to help me; however, Sierra barely ever came back. She only seemed to come back when she was requested and only helped me in and out of one dress.

I had told her exactly what I didn't want and she kept bringing stuff that had things I didn't want. She was VERY NICE, VERY PROFESSIONAL, and handled my relatives without getting frustrated. However, they were frustrated with her. My future mother-in-law had to pull a lot of the dresses, and most of her pulls were ones I actually liked. Most of Sierra's pulls were ones I did not. She pulled some silhouettes that were nice but nothing that wowed me or really impressed me.

The dressing room wasn't big enough for the dress, much less the dress and two people. The store itself looked unimpressive. Sierra just was not a good match for me. They didn't have the Melissa Sweet line which was my fav dress when looking through magazines, but Sierra told me the Scottsdale store had the line but probably not the dress. She didn't take the 2 minutes out to call and check for me, but I did.  They had it and accommodated a walk-in. The Scottsdale store set me up with Alison and she was amazing. Even though she too had another client, she made me feel like her only client and she was SO sweet and nice. I really appreciated her and everything she did for me! Because of Alison, I found my dress (turns out the Melissa Sweet I loved wasn't it either) and I ACTUALLY feel like a bride now.  I recommend going to the Scottsdale Fashion Square store EVEN IF THE Paradise Valley store is closer. The rooms are bigger, nicer, and the seating is more comfortable for your family. They have mirrors IN THE ROOMS and the selection is much nicer. The store appears smaller than the PV store but it is SO MUCH nicer than the PV store. Trust me, you won't regret skipping PV and going straight to Scottsdale.  (Ask for Alison too! :))Own filed for bankruptcy. Locked the doors. No notice. Just left a note on the door. If you've preorder comics with Atomic Comics please contact Samurai Comics at (602) 265-8886 they have worked with Diamond to get your shipments.If I a can give a ZERO I would say that it is too much.  This company will take your credit card and charge you whatever they want.  I would rather have no one in my house than these chit chatty, irresponsible and disrespectful people in my home!!! I would NEVER use them againVisited Coco's on a Monday afternoon (parking lot was "unusually" sparse.. counted 3 cars total.  Seating was quick, order was taken quickly, salads were delivered quickly.  The main entree didn't arrive until 30 minutes later (entire restaurant was empty except maybe 2-3 tables.  Someone must have to slaughter a cow to make 2 cheeseburgers.  My stomach felt upset for about an hour afterwards.. Service was A-ok, waitress had to be reminded to refill the tea, didn't take up completed dishes (manager took some of the dishes and said he be right back to pick up the rest  - - didn't happen.  Waitress was advised to split the checks - - didn't happen, sent her back to make the change.

Coco's gong down the same path as Marie Callendars..Another disgusting tasting Chinese joint in Phoenix.  My order was simple - steamed dumplings and wonton soup.  The meat inside the filling tasted like something very questionable - not pork, not chicken, not beef.  Something dark and oily and ominous.  I could not eat either dish as both tasted as if they were filled with meat from the same mystery animal.

Waste of money.  So I ended up eating a small portion of a visiting relative's chicken and shrimp combo which was almost devoid of meat (might be a good thing, actually) and had absolutely no spice or kick or flavor. 

Will not be back.Arrived tonight just after our scheduled time and found ourselves grabbing a number like at the dmv. I've come here once before a few years ago and this was not the case. Waited for 45 minutes before getting helped (which for us was 17 tickets being called), and was given a measly response as to why they were the only car rental company in the place with a line like that (we have more cars than everyone else, it's spring training).

One woman's job appeared to be shouting out the next number and being rude to the people who couldn't get the ticket thing to work (it stopped working twice while we were waiting and both times she didn't say a word to the very nice people who approached her and said they couldn't grab a number). I went up to ask her a question when they turned off the "cars available" sign and she made me feel super great with her initial slow blink and one word responses. Great choice for customer service!

We were assigned a car after the standard up-sell attempts and walked down to the lot to find no car in our spot. Two people in the lot were extremely nice and helpful and got us another car right away but it was done so hastily and without checking with anyone that I wondered if that's what happened to our car in the first place. 

After being told we would have a full tank of gas and agreed to bringing it back that way, the car was at a solid 3/4 tank.

It was bad enough I don't plan on using Budget ever again.Not rating new times specifically, but their friday food truck event. Visited here for the tlicious tacos. I would avoid this event on fridays and hike the extra 2 miles to get to the food truck friday event at the phoenix public market. Its a nicer atmosphere and a bigger selection of food trucks to pick from.The worst brisket I have ever encountered. Sometimes, the run down shack atmosphere with the dirt parking lot places are where the best food is found, but in this case the crappy outside matches the lousy food inside this terrordome. The entire brisket sandwich combo platter was a complete mess. I heard bells ringing in the back of this place which indicated my brisket was being nuked and then placed on the sesame bun from the grocery store. There was so much fat on this brisket that nothing was edible at all. I mean, fat ripped through every lousy strip of the gross meat that they claim was smoked on premises. There was some very yellow potato salad that was served as my side dish and it tasted very relishy, but not homemade as the the one employee said. A place just can't really operate with one employee either. It's time to raize this shack and let someone build something pretty and nice in this rundown neighborhood. worst brisket ever.My advice is DO NOT live by the basketball courts or in the "A" buildings (even though it's the cheapest area and there is a reason why it's cheap). I have lived here for almost ten months and all I can say is "HOLLY CRAP" there is a lot of freakin kids. My neighbors love to smoke pot and it sucks for people who don't smoke. Kids are always crying in the middle of the night and running up and down the stairs. Teenagers are walking around in the middle of the night being loud. There was a car with a busted window so, don't leave anything valuable in the car. My neighbors down stairs are always fighting and I can hear the wife crying. If you need to sleep in the day time, FORGET about sleeping if you live in those apartments...  When we 1st saw the place they took us to the north part of the apartment which is nice and peaceful. They then told us we were in the "A" building which turned out to be a freakin zoo! Kids are everywhere with no adult supervision and the children love to play chicken with the cars! We almost hit some kids playing that game and we get paranoid when we come home. So... cheap apartment = ghetto and headaches. Pay extra money for a better place so you don't have to worry about your car nor your sanity.I have a similar story about Advanced Auto Service.

Went in for a routine oil change and came back with a repair order of over $3000 based on the steering. New rack and pinion, shocks, the works.

I politely declined and went to get a second estimate elsewhere. I didn't show this second autoshop the quote Advanced Auto gave me. He asked whether I was there because I've been quoted repairs, and showed him the quote. He laughed at it. My car needed none of the repairs I'd been quoted on.

He even guessed which auto shop had quoted me before I showed him it was from Advanced Auto Service on Warner street. So my advice is be careful.I'm a big sushi fan and not incredibly picky, but this experience was very odd. The Yelp reviews were good so we went. They were busy when we got there so we waited a bit which wasn't terrible but consistently the service was slow and another waitress had to basically take over our table. Worst of all, the sushi was bizarre. I ordered an Alaskan roll and spicy tuna and the Alaskan came out as a gigantic roll with piles of salmon and mayo-filled fake crab salad and no avocado. I appreciate the value I guess? but having the huge roll with that in it was inedible and I have never not finished a sushi roll. The spicy tuna had tons of mayo-y spicy tuna and then more fake crab mush. Our tofu tempura appetizer came out after the entrees. The music was also strange- loud 90s music. The hibachi chef clanging in the corner with a gaggle of women yelling 'woohoo!' didn't add to the experience. Not sure we'll be back.**THE MOST GROSS DISGUSTING HOTEL IN AZ, CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS**** DO NOT STAY HERE!

I flew some work employees down to AZ for a training that lasted a week.  Not being from AZ I went on Hotels.com and saw some fairly pleasant reviews about this hotel.  I showed it to my reps and they loved the fact that it had a small kitchen that they could cook their own food!  Great!!  I booked the hotel

I get a call from one of my reps on Monday who is also at the brink of tears. She said that a huge baseball team was there with the families.  Kids screaming, ruining up and down the hallways.  Rooms were filthy, sheets were disgusting, towels not clean.  Also this baseball team was indoors smoking pot...which lingered through the entire hotel.  One of  my girls stuffed dirty towels under the door to block the smoke coming into her room.   Finally they had had enough, so they go to to the front desk and wait to stand in line behind the WHOLE OTHER GROUP OF GUESTS WHO WENT DOWN TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE SMOKE AND ALL THE NOISE THIS BASEBALL TEAM WAS MAKING.

The college kids who work the front desk really didn't give a rip and said "sorry, nothing we can do"   I got a hold of the district managers cell phone and call and left a msg...did she call me back ..HELL NO....LOL..wasn't surprised that I didn't get one.

Needless to say I immediately moved them to the Comfort Inn in Chandler and they LOVED IT!! Clean, quiet...customer service was incredible!

I have any more trainings to send my reps to and this hotel most certainly will not get my money...........Just  ordered a margherita pizza, large salad and large cannoli.  My husband and I could not finish anything. The service was not that friendly. The pizza was terrible, had tons of sauce and the cheese was not  melted entirely. The salad came in two different containers, super small but paid for a large. The cannoli had tons of the filling so it was way too sweet, might as well just call it something else as it was just covered and swimming in a white NON RICOTTA sweet  cream.  We really wanted to find a nice pizza place close to home but for now we are going to stick to Spinattos. It's sad that we haven't found a great pizza in Ahwatukee yet. We are never coming back to this location, nothing really was worth the money. I'm very sorry for the bad review but I wish I had not spend my money there tonight as I'm writing this review still hungry and with a bad taste in my mouth. :( I really wonder if the other reviews are real....While the selection is decent in the store for a one stop shop of baby gear the service is mediocre at best. Every time I have been in the store my receipt has been inaccurate and takes an extreme amount of time to correct it. An the associates are always very defensive and short when you inquire on pricing. Also note that online prices vary from store prices so you must ask for a price match (which they also won't be happy to give you). Glad my registry is complete so I can find a better store to support.If you aren't afraid of getting shanked, catching an std, losing your teeth, or being judged by a nasty, over weight, ugly bartenders & patrons then by all means visit "Ugly" Monkeys. I was hoping to find a chill dive bar near my apts....I'll keep on looking.First snow of the season in Arizona this weekend.... went to check out the website, as I like to shop local.... I'm a pear shaped woman... I require a size xl in snowboard pants.  I want something cute, no luck...every pant I looked at....Ride, 686, DC....all not available in XL...Did I mention they are all current season items I'm looking at.....I would understand if I was trying to get a deal... the website clearly has a size chart for  each brand and the measurements for XL are clearly stated on the size chart.... but there are no XL SIZES available to purchase.  Come on Ski Pro... where is your love for the curvy girl? I'll shop some where else where I can get my size and look stylish.....We will not be coming here in the future.  I read some reviews before deciding to go here on a Friday night w hubby, we wanted something sweet.  Based on a review by a former employee, we got a banana split to share since it has 3 scoops of ice custard.  We were very disappointed when it came.  The scoops were a third size of Baskin Robbins.My grandma and I walked in to a line of 7-8 people waiting to be seated.  Customers were talking among themselves and to us about how they weren't sure how long the wait was because no one greeted them and surveyed the many empty tables available. One group of folks walked out after waiting. April finally came by after 5 or 10 minutes and seated the growing line.  When it was our turn, April didn't once make eye contact with us. Not even after reaching our table and seating us.  I figured maybe she was stressed out or busy... But still. That really set the mood. 

I don't remember our waitresses name. But I can tell you that she wasn't all that concerned with us for at least another 10 minutes. When she did visit our table, she was very unenthused about it and made me feel like she must have been waitressing for 20+ years... and is just sick of it. 
Grandma and I both decided on soup and salad.  Butternut squash soup looked like my grandma was eating baby food. Gross! Consistency, color, taste, everything. My tortilla chicken soup was slopped all around my bowl, there was more tortilla chips than soup... And the tortilla soup wasn't even tasty. Just bad.  Our waitress did not seem concerned that we didn't eat much at all of our soup as she brought out our salads. Even after I told her mine was just awful, I get a "alright, do you want something else?" And that was that. Uh, no I don't. 

We got up to leave after about 20-30 seconds of investigating our salads for traces of chicken. Mine had NONE and hers had a whopping 3 pieces.  Caesar salad was practically glued together by thick dressing and sprinkled with breadcrumbs or something. 

We waited politely at the cashiers counter (which is where you take your bill to pay) to inform someone that we were leaving. Caroline wasn't our waitress, but arrived and appeared genuinely upset by our experience and asked us if she could please wait on us in her section. Poor girl had no idea what we'd been through (not to mention the layer of dust covering the place).  She insists on bringing the manager over... Only to find out that it was April: the first gal who sat us at our table. 

The only thing Coco's has going for it is Caroline.  She was empathetic and professional.

Caroline: get a serving job somewhere more your speed (meaning better). 

Yelpers: OMG RUN FOR THE HILLS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T PAY A DIME FOR THIS CRAP AND LEFT HUNGRY.Sweet reply, from the swapmeet employee but think about this- charging a 10$ minimum is still extortion. (An excessive or exorbitant charge.)What doughnut store has no doughnuts? Dunkin Donuts, that's who... Four times I've visited this particular store and each time - usually after 3pm - nearly all their donuts were sold out. I get that they get lots of business early in the day, but they are also a doughnut store and shouldn't matter what time of day I visit. This would be like going to Dairy Queen for ice cream only to discover they had none. 
What Dunkin always seems to have is their piss-water flavored coffee, problem with that is they are not a coffee shop, if they want to be a coffee shop then they should change their name to Dunkin Coffee. 
I've complained several times to their corporate webpage, only to be completely ignored. So, we are done with Dunkin - there is a Krispy Kreme just up the street and they have a better selection of doughnuts, at a better price, any time of the day which are actually made fresh, not shipped to the store frozen.It was okay last year - nothing great but nothing bad.  Maybe it's because we've had some pretty great food this last year, but we weren't pleased with this place and will not return..  The food on the plate ran together.  It looked like soup.  We couldn't even make out the enchiladas as they were covered with the rice and soup-like sauce.   It was an awful presentation.  The sauce around the edges of the plate looked like it had been overcooked and burned.  The meat in the taco was seasoned really weird.  It was awful.  I couldn't eat it.  We love Mexican food and this place is at the bottom of the barrel.  The service was slow and food took forever.My husband and I both ordered pasta, and we both ended up with food poisoning, the sauce was super salty and, something was cross contaminated or under cooked for as sick as we both ended up.I've got to admit, I was extremely disappointed with their service.  We ordered a pizza and waited for 1.5 hours.  When we finally called to see what exactly was taking them so long, they simply said they couldn't find our location.  I understand there may not be many people with some sort of gps device.  However, after giving them the cross streets and not receiving any sign of misunderstanding from their end, I thought they were good to go.  They said they made a phone call to notify us; when we never received one.  I just hope the charge is reversed like they said they would.  Needless to say, I won't be ordering pizza from them due to their poor customer service.This place is closed as of 01/14/2012Buyer beware! (literally)  

The services provided aren't worth the extreme frustration caused by their inept billing, which is further compounded by illogical response from ownership.  

Find another therapy office that won't waste your time and make you regret ever trusting them with your personal information.DISGUSTING...Dnt waist your time or money.They were too busy to take our take-out order! Too bad. But...I'm glad they're so busy they didn't miss us!I went there tonight, but sadly this Scottsdale location is out of business.It's been a while since I have been to this location but I had a store credit there so I thought I should spend it. My experience was even worse than before! The selection was terrible for clothing. I found two items that were ok but upon closer inspection one had a hole and the second a stain. I did find a few toys to buy but when I went to the register no-one greeted me and they acted like I was annoying them by being there. I am afraid I am not able to give this store any more chances. 

Oh and after my last review I got this email from "S D." Thought it was kind of funny...

"I find it interesting that you have so much time to complain about businesses flaws like you dont have any yourself. Who knows what those ladies could have delt with on that day you visited their store. I shop there all the time and NEVER have I had an unpleasent experience. I have seen costumers yell, curse, and insult these girls and they still manage to have fun and not let costumers like yourself put them down. You give them respect and they will show it right back. They have many new girls working their now so try stopping by and seeing the new look then judge."Tricky pricing. Only worthwhile if you buy items on sale and have coupons.A friend suggested that we play golf at Starfire, little (short) resort style course on Hayden in Scottsdale.
I don't want to get off on a rant here, but will someone (other than me...I did tell them but the blank stares I encountered lead me to believe that my diatribe was ineffective and possibly not even understood by the staff at Starfire) tell them to give the Armor All a rest!
I suppose the course is nice enough...I've played there many times since I moved to town.
I suppose the prices are reasonable...I have certainly paid more to play a course in worse condition.
So why the one star for a place called Starfire? Somebody needs to tell the morons in the cart barn or out in the staging area to give the Armor All a rest!!!!!
I appreciate a pretty, shiny golf cart as much as the rest of hacking community...but don't spray it all over the cart...and don't spray it so it drips places where I will put my hands!!!!
Once the still wet Armor All gets on your hands, you are done golfing until you:
A - get some solvent to get this crap out of all the little ridges and cracks in my hands...not good...it took 2 days, and;
B - Get a good golf shop to re-grip ALL of your golf clubs to the tune of approx. $100
You cannot play golf if you can't hang onto the club and with Armor All on your hands, you literally (and I don't mean figuratively...I literally mean literally) cannot hold onto a golf club and swing it...it just won't be happening. I quit after 3 holes.
No satisfaction when I asked for a refund or some sort recompense (they did offer me a cart which wasn't dripping with Armor All, but the damage was done by then).
I doubt I'll spend my golfing dollars there again.They microwave the eggs and meat and didn't have any bagels at left at 9am.  Won't be returning, though the service was ok.This place is not good. If you're Asian you will not like this place and think this place is very Western. The owners clearly cater to the White clientele of the area. Nothing here is authentic. For example I was served Pringles with my salt and pepper calamari. 

I wouldn't recommend this place.If you like dated restaurants, with carpet that hasn't been clean in a decade, with an air quality that is stuffy and smelly, with long waits because they don't have enough waiters on the floor, and recipes that use the same 4 ingredients in all their dishes (one of them being LOTS of salt), then Riazzi's is the restaurant for you.I vow to never step foot into this mcdonald's again.  It is by far, the nastiest McDonald's I have ever visited.  

We went in today for an after school mcflurry.  The place smelled bad (think vomit) and it was dirty.  The upholstered chairs are in such bad shape that they have been "repaired" with duct tape all along the entire bank of tables.  

This place gives me the creeps.  So long McDonald's.  I don't think I'll miss you.So the happy hour is really cheap... I can't deny that.  $2 drafts and $2.50 wells.  However that bar itself doesn't have much else to offer.  

I am a really big dive bar fan and appreciate a relaxed and informal environment.  However, beyond being informal I like my dives to have some character... something distinguishing.  Unfortunately Horse and Hound totally lacks in this arena.  Its much more ghetto for its location than I was anticipating.  I was disappointed in the place...its all very obvious. Sports games on, pool tables, harsh lighting, nothing fun on the walls, very standard decorum....  

Its just a place that you can have a drink in... nothing that special about it.  If I am going to pay for a drink then I am also paying for the environment I am in.... otherwise I will drink at home by the pool etc. Horse and Hound just did not cut it for me.My coworker and I stopped there got lunch yesterday. The food tasted great but that night we were both sick to our stomachs. Another coworker saw our food and went there w her kids later that evening and also got sick. Her son found a geico in the bathroom!!!Finally shampooed the dog myself. FYI Casper's, she does not have any naturally yellow fur- it's as white a new fallen snow and very shiny now. I have told everyone how you lied to me about shampooing my dog,and I will continue to let people know about your dishonest practice.These guys are crooks and deceiving liars. Do not go here! I went in today to get a quote of brakes, they broke my window and claimed it just fell after shutting my door, then they added about ten other things to the quote, one of the things being my rear shocks leaking, and have the quote telling me it would be for the original same shocks that on our the truck, these guys do not even know their vehicles. He quoted me for the bottom of the line shock, knowing my truck comes standard with bilstein shocks. They would not listen to me when I said "no" put my vehicle back together and I am leaving. Continued on and on with ridiculous prices. Do not go here!  They are scum of the scum.  You can know that I will never come back.After my last visit, I have to wonder why anyone would spend their money at this restaurant.  With the many FINE quality burger joints In the area, this by far is sub par.  Once a nice place to take the family is now run by a crew of misfits starting at the top.  When taking one step in this eatery it's painfully obvious there is tension among the staff, making for an uncomfortable experience from the get go.  I over heard fowl language from "Savana"?  I believe her name was.  When I have a small child with me this is not what I want them to hear.  I asked another employee who was tending to the condiment station who was the manager and they pointed to a short blond young woman who's appearance left something to be desired.  I decided then & there I would observe before speaking with her...just as I thought.  She too conducted herself like a child & not like a leader. I have spent the better of 30 years in a profession where I was required to notice small details. These details tell a lot about a person, situation or environment. Fuddruckers fell short in all areas. If the "feel" is off when u enter a place the meal is less enjoyable. I hardly noticed the quality of food because i was so put off by the first 10 minutes. The food was somewhat enjoyable, but nothing like it used to be. I feel as though if I'm going to pay 12 bucks for a burger meal, it should be served to me. (I can go across the street & get a nice steak dinner for 10 bucks!) With that being said, if everything is spectacular, these are the little things I'd over look. The charm of the place, if u will...I can get a cheaper, better tasting burger in 5 other places with in a mile of Fudds.  Overall this place need a complete makeover from management to menu.  If u don't care about your restaurant then why should I?  I sure hope this place can be saved,  it once was a great fun family spot!Wow. From the moment I walked in the door to the moment I stepped outside I felt lost inside a maze. I searched the whole store for an employee. Finally when I found one the next isle over from where I needed to look she just told me it was in the next isle. She was just locking the cabinet and not helping any other customers. Then I proceed to pass by the break room and find practically the entire store in the break room hanging out. So when I am ready to pay I stand in the only check out line while the 2nd employee actually on the sales floor stands at her register cleaning it. REALLY?!?! Do I need another review saying that I work in retail and hold my standards high! This store has terrible customer service. Another reason I will shop Hobby Lobby from now on!These guys are as uncooperative and inconvienent as you can get. If you rent with a debit card they will hassle you to no end. Two utility bills proving you are at said address and bank statement of proof of connection to debit card. Thats a lot of personal information they dont need and unethical employees could swipe this information easily. The women there are just idiots and have no friendliness or able to accomodate anything. DONT EVER GO HERE!!! The car selection is bad too.To be fair, i will start this review off by saying i have eaten here once or twice in the past and it was "better" than my last experience. But my last experience will be just that...my last.

My boyfriend and i sat outside, which is a very small area, right on the sidewalk. The misters are a nice touch, but don't really reach you. I am a strict vegetarian (vegan actually) so ordered off the a la carte menu and ordered "vegetable tacos" and "potato tacos"...one would assume something called a "vegetable taco" would be vegetarian, but just to make sure, i asked our waitress. She said very confidently that there was no meat in them. I requested no cheese on them even. When the dishes came out, my boyfriend asked me what was in the tacos, so i started to push the food around with my fork to get a better look and it's a darn good thing i did, because all of a sudden i saw big chunks of fish. GROSS! I nearly lost my appetite. We explained to the waitress the problem and she didn't have the apologetic reaction i would have expected. She was less than sympathetic but took my plate back and got me new tacos. Once we began eating though, our table slowly became infested with flies. They were all over the chips and salsa, all over the glasses of water, all over US...it got so bad that i couldn't even eat anymore. It was disgusting.  We spent our entire meal swatting flies and pushing them off ourselves and our food. Add to that, an employee from the restaurant next door literally walking over to in front of right where we sitting to beat out a filthy dusty carpet, with plumes of dust going everywhere. I had had it. Truly awful experience and will not be back!TERRRIBLE customer experience!!!! Limited menu during "Lunch hours", but willing to make execptions.... We were hoping for butter or olive oil for the bread.... we were told we had to wait until she was done wrapping silverware before she would be able to bring it to us.... then she brought one of four meals to the table... we waited over 10 minutes before the waitress showed up to offer more drinks... all we wanted was our food and her EXCUSE was she was busy with other tables.... but no one esle was there, but two other tables that showed up after us already had ALL of their meals! VERY DISAPOINTING!!!!! When she did show up... her tie grazed over all of the one dish that we had for over 10 minutes! GROSS! We will NEVER eat there again! AT ANY loacation!My fiance made an appointment about 3 months before this incident, which was March 18th 2013. She arrived 5 minutes before her appointment at 1055 am. Her, her mother and a friend entered the store through the unlocked doors and were then told to leave because they were not open. What kind of store unlocks the doors and then tells the customers they aren't open? Well the three of them waited till 5 minutes after they opened at 11am and were the first ones in the door. They were the first to sign in and they had an appointment. So why were other customers seen to before they were? Shoddy Management. They waited 40 minutes to be seen, while other customers just went right ahead and were seen before them. Even while waiting they asked for help and were turned down by excessively rude customer service employees.

The one star is only because I cannot give one lower. They have shoddy management, they have poor customer service, their word doesn't mean anything to them.One star is a bit harsh. 

So was the service.


So was the food.


So was the environment and atmosphere.

Look, here is the deal, this place used to be great but time has clearly taken a quick toll on Abuelos.  What my family experienced the evening we stopped in was unforgivable.  We arrived later than usual for dinner so I know they were still recovering from their first large seating, but bottom line, the restaurant was a disaster.  Dirty tables, messy floors, and enough crying kids to make it really feel like a Dennys on Swap-Meet day. 

Wait, that is not fair to Dennys.

Anyways, the server forgot the appetizer order.  Completely.  

The food for the main dish came out lukewarm at best.  I thought Fajitas came out sizzling and snapping?  Nope, not this evening.  

Drinks were not refilled EVER.

This whole deal was a miss.  The manager never came around to even ask how the meal was...lucky for him or her.

Anyways, this was crappy enough that we even thought of writing a letter, but after this disaster who would want to even go back.  NEVER AGAIN.I've been to this car wash 4 times. I pass other car washes just to come here. On this visit they have broken my ignition key and now I cannot start my car. The idiot that did it just handed my keys back to me like nothing was wrong. I'm pissed and stranded. I will never come back here again! And what is they're compensation: cards for 2 free car washes. Really!Can't recommend this place. Hate judging a bad experience on one visit but felt rushed, service was not that friendly and the wash machine did not even dry half my car. I had to park and go find the guy that I paid and tell him. He had to get someone to come over and hand dry my car. By that time much of the soap that had also not been rinsed off left streaks on the car.

Would have been better off just going to Terribles.We got the avocado and lobster dip entree. It cost $10 bucks and I kid you not we only got 15 little chips and the whole thing was so salty we couldn't even get through it all. The baby back ribs tasted OK and the fries were awesome but after about 30 minutes we both had upset stomachs. Needless to say the whole experience was a letdown (it was my first time there) and a waste of $50 dollars (which is way to expensive for a casual dinner, in my eyes). However, the servers were very nice and hospitable, so that's a plus.Used to love coming here for breakfast when it was a diner with real diner food. They have changed it over to a coffee and snack takeout. I don't bother coming here anymore. What a loss.liars, thieves, dont keep their word and are worse in customer service. i will never return again and neither will my friends or family. i love toyota vehicles, but i will have to invest in a honda.Rude staff, and they were all sick too!! Stay at home! They even had the gall to take my money 30 min past my appt time and before any services were done. That's. first. I see why now, people walked out. Do not go here, don't even say thank you after taking your moneyI took my boys to get their haircut here for the first time we usually go to cool cuts but decided to give this a try we got called by a african american lady with really short hair she didn't ask me how long I wanted my son's hair she just started snipping away I told her I don't want it too short and she starts arguing with me saying shes been doing this for 13 years and how I should have told her how long I wanted it!!! She didn't even ask!!!! I cannot believe she said that to me I told her to get my son out of the chair I was not going to put up with her nasty attitude so I had emily and another lady cut my boys hair they where great but throughout the stay she kepts talking about me with another client she had and just giving me an angry glare the whole time I don't understand how someone can be so nasty towards a paying customer. Only reason im giving it 1 star is because emily did an amazing job.if i did not have to go here for insurance i would not ! they are close that's it !! i get that they want you to sign in sit down shut up and stay that way till called !!! but to yell at people who have a question , that is wrong !!! older people kept coming in ,  forgot the sign,sit,shutup!! asked a question and got yelled at , u are there to help not make people feel like crap !!!!Today at legacy urgent care I was appalled by the behavior of the front seat lady. She was rude to me and my mother. My mom called to pay my deductible, she slammed the phone down on her and she cursed under her breathe. Her name is Elizabeth. I have never been treated so horribly here, but she has always been a little rude, today just went too far.Service Sucked.
Food Sucked (Pho broth was loaded with MSG and barely any other seasoning..it was like chicken broth + msg, chicken was dry, rice was funny tasting, and the Cha (meat cake) tasted GROSS.)
You even failed to get our order right even after 3 different people at our table repeated it. 
FAILWow what a let down.  This place has fallen apart.  They changed their bread and the BANH MI SANDWICHES TOTALLY SUCK ASS NOW.  The bread used to be really good and very large.  Now its hard, crusty, stale, and almost half the size.  I've been back twice to make sure it wasn't a fluke.  Also, I used to love all the fresh veg they use here but on my last sandwich there was like a teaspoon of carrots.  I've posted photos of both the old award winning banh mi and the new ass-sucking one.  You decide.

Since the banh mi were the only good thing they served, I have no reason to go here anymore.  

Until I find some place better, Hue Thai has the best banh mi sandwiches I know of in LV.Simply put...gross. I only needed some liquid foundation in the beauty department. A lot out of stock, and what was in stock was previously opened. There was makeup smeared everywhere. Ugh. 
The bathroom was nasty. There was nothing nice about it. Looked like it could use a power wash. Outside there were carts everywhere. Poorly managed store. Will never go back, even though I drive by this location every day to work.On my drunken conquest to visit my very first all nude strip club, our cab driver suggested this place. We pulled into the parking lot, saddled up with our driver, and at 5:45am, we were told the place was closing at 6am and that they were not allowing any more clients for the evening. BOO!Food is good but their service is getting worse each time.
We came as a party of 7 and the bill was $208.38 which has already included 18% gratuity. We paid cash and added extra $4 to make it 20% gratuity.
We went downstairs and this waitress named Mami yelled from upstairs saying that we owed her $1. It was very embarrassing for our whole group because of her action chasing after us with the bill in her hand. Everyone from the tea station was looking at us.
My sister went upstairs and talked to her.
The amount for the food was $169 and they automatically added 18% gratuity which was $208.38. We paid them in cash $212 with the extra $4. Someone internally from their restaurant took away that $4. 
Well $1, $4.. Whatever it was that not our main concern... Is it proper to yell and chase after customer for 38 cents short from the gratuity so that whole mall can hear that??!!!
There was no apology from her at all.
No matter how awesome the food is... lousy customer service can turn customers away. That's really too bad... We used to visit this restaurant every time we visit Vegas. No more!!!People are rude. My husband is caucasion but knows all the things we like. He has gone twice and twice, the check out guy treated him poorly. Like he wasn't even there. First time, the guy just looked at him and didn't say a word. The other time, he got passed up on line!!!
What is that about??No coffee ready at 5 am? Really. Nothing much else to say.Capriotti's is just not for me.  I have tried the Bobbie twice, it is just not that interesting.  Thanksgiving is once a year for a reason.  Plus having this as a random sandwich shop is much too heavy from a deli.  It just doesn't make since to me.  Nothing else looked or sounded appealing either.  After 3 visits, Capriotti's is not a stop for me.I was very disappointed with the management of Presidential Limo. We were trying to surprise our friend for her bachelorette party by having a limo waiting for us when we arrived in Las Vegas. We got off our flight and headed down to baggage claim expecting to see someone w/a sign waiting for us. Nobody there. No big deal, we call the number. Mass confusion ensues, there is someone there but he doesn't seem to know his way around the airport? He can't tell us where he is but wants us to come to him. Seeing as how we don't know where we are, that doesn't work so well. Finally he comes up and meets us, then leads us down into a sketch parking garage...not exactly the grand start to our vacation that we had imagined, but we're pretty laid back, so no biggie. Then we get to the car. It's old, it's ugly, ugh. Now we're a little bummed. We hop in and then we see the mess. Food crumbs on the seats, floors need to be vacuumed, USED glasses everywhere! We were supposed to get champagne and roses, instead we get half empty cocktail glasses rimmed in lipstick, martini glasses with half eaten olives, crumpled napkins, and not even a bottle of water for the 4 of us. Not cool. At least make an attempt to hide the mess instead of leaving it out in the open. Nasty.
The ride back was better, although still no champagne. The driver was early, very nice and personable, and a billion times better than the driver on our first leg. Too bad at that point we were so exhausted from our weekend that we didn't really care. The surprise had been blown and ruined by the poor service and gross car on the day of our arrival. All the drivers and people we spoke with on the phone were nice, but obviously there is some mis-management going on behind the scenes. This is the kind of treatment I would expect from one of the cheaper limo companies in Vegas, but we opted for a pricier company because they promised top-class service. I would never use them again and would warn others looking for a nice, classy ride to look elsewhere.I went here this morning looking for Vegan donuts after reading several reviews. The place is small, and there is not much of a selection of donuts. Mostly just the basics - glazed, twists, bars, and some cake donuts with various frostings.

There is no signage indicating that anything is vegan, and when I asked the guy behind the counter he didn't seem to get what I was asking. It seemed like I had to ask about every donut, and after asking the second and third times I realized I didn't believe him about the vegan varieties.

I left without buying anything, and will not go back.Just update, new  management, maybe new owner.Ok.

Let me just start out by saying that this is a great Mexican Food Restaurant.

If you loathe Mexican food.

Best thing about eating lunch here? It was out of me less than two hours later!

Explosively.

Really. I swear.

My bud had a 2 for 1 coupon and asked me to join him to talk biz ,so, being cheap, fat and hungry, I said, "sure'. I knew where the place was ( who hasn't bought street drugs at some point in their lives? Don't judge me!) and made it there only to enter 1981 Mexico. The "decor" is barely that. Some frescoes of someone's idea of Mexico could have used a Silkwood shower and the tables looked like ,well, nothing.

The first bad sign? Stale, tasteless chips and some sort of salsa juice. WTF? I mean this set up was so bad even my friend (who will eat anything.) only finished 1/4 of them.

The menu is very typical White suburbia version of Mexican "Combinacciones Platos". I was actually in the mood for that. It's like you know it's not real Mexican food but you love it anyway. 

And then I made a mistake that would cause our waitress, Surlyrella, to decide that she and I were NOT going to be Freunden. 

Not.

"You know what? I'll have a cheese taco as well as my Enchiladas", I gamely said to the looming rock of hate. "CHEESE TACO?', she hissed. 

We stared at each other like two mean Wildebeest about to go all Wild Kingdom on each other. Being Gay, I was not about to back down.

"It's a TACO WITH CHEESE", I looked her gaze right back at her now beady steely eyes.

"Hmph", she shot back in a way that said, "screw you and your mother for letting you down the birth canal!"

So.

The "food" came.

As did the next twenty minutes of my choking down some of the blandest globs of cheese, rice and beans that I have endured since Swanson decided to take on the Mexican TV tray market. 

It came, but it didn't went fast enough for me.

Fast forward to me back at work breaking my cardinal rule, "No number 2 at the office!' 

Explosively.

Oh yeah. That cheese taco? A hard shell with some cheese shoved in with that nasty from the bag shredded lettuce you get on clearance at Food For Less. Despicable.

I hate this place and strongly suggest you eat at , well, anywhere other than here.This place is a hot mess.  I came here to watch my sister-in-law and her husband renew their vows at the drive-thru and it was a nightmare from start to finish.  

Here's how my run-down with the employees went:
-"Hi, my sister is going to be coming through the drive-thru, where should we stand?  She's not here yet and there's another ceremony outside and we don't want to get in the way."
-Blank stare
-"Should we just wait outside?"
-"What's the name?"
-"Melissa ____."
-"I didn't check in no one by that name."
-"Yea, they aren't here yet.  Is there somewhere we can wait for them?"
-"There's some chairs by the window."  Points to outside and then walks away.

Seriously?  You can't even act a little happy in a place where dozens of people get married every day?  You can't be a little helpful?

So Melissa and her husband show up in their limo and are ready to cheese it up in Vegas.  They fill out the paperwork, pay, and then wait.  And then they waited for 40 more minutes.  In a limo.  In the drive-thru. 

They were ready to just forget the whole thing and get their money back but were told (by a completely unapologetic employee) that it would only be 10 more minutes.  Apparently we were waiting for a minister to do the service, even though they were only renewing their vows.  They don't keep someone around just for regular old ceremonies?

Finally the pastor shows up, apologizes, and proceeds to run through the ceremony.  I videotaped it and it took a whole 4.5 minutes.  After the ceremony, he IMMEDIATELY hands them an envelope and tells them "he doesn't get paid by the chapel."  Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh.

I'm sorry, but you need to work out some kind of contract where you get paid per service you preform.  Or, the chapel should just require a tip as part of their pricing and give it to the minister to save him the hassle.  I really don't want to bad-mouth the pastor because he seemed nice enough, but to me that just seemed like it was in really poor taste.

What bothered my sister-in-law the most was that she called THREE times ahead of this to see if she needed to reserve a spot.  Three times she was told no and that it wouldn't be a problem, just come to the drive-thru and she would be taken care of.  I guess the chapel just assumes people like to wait in limos (that are being rented by the hour) next to a dirty chapel for an hour during their vacation.

The chapel is old and beat up, the cherubs are falling off the ceiling in the drive-thru like they are trying to escape their misery, and the employees are slow and unfriendly.  After having my own renewal at Viva Las Vegas, I cannot believe how completely different this chapel turned out to be.

The only good thing about this place is that their services are cheap (before your tip to the minister, of course).

I would only recommend if you enjoy top-notch Vegas kitsch or if you think you might have cold feet and you want to give yourself an extra 50 minutes before the ceremony to really think it through.They called us to come At 2.we waited more than an hour for the assistance .wtf.we made a reservation before.bad serviceI have been to Florida Cafe numerous times during the past 8 years because I live with Cubans and I LOVE Cuban food, and this last time will hopefully be my LAST time.  It was never better than ok, and now it is ridiculous. The decor is nice, the wait staff is nice.  However, the food is terribly expensive and it isn't very good.  The rice and beans are mediocre, and the ropa vieja is uninspired.  The piss poor service is what sent me over the edge this time.  Saturday afternoon, several employees roaming around, but none with the title, seemingly, of waiter/waitress.  Seriously?  Is it that difficult to get drink service?  What about a refill?  Can I have one of those?  Could someone check to make sure that everyone received what they ordered and that it was satisfactory?  Apparently not. Picadillo?  Ick.  Papas rellenos?  Ick....were those INSTANT potatoes?  They DID make damn sure to send someone over to take a photo of my group and then hit us up for a $20.00 photo.  Um...No.  Thank you, no mas.  If you are familiar with Porto's in L.A....this isn't even close.  There is a reason that there is always a line there, and never one here.  
For authentic food, try Rincon Criollo down the street.  Indifferent service, sketchy location, horrible decor, but AWESOME food.This place is the absolute worst place I've ever had to sit and wait for food that was never brought to me (45 minutes). After waiting all that time, the waitress told me they didn't have what I ordered. This was my second time here. The first time was not that great either. Food was bland, portions were small and dishes were dirty.  Marginal at best. Only tried it the second time based on yelp reviews. This place is disgusting and should be shut down.  If you want Thai, try lotus (in same shopping center) or chada on jones and spring mountain.Nothing much has changed here.  I needed a specific product and tried to call the store, no answer.  As it was just after 5 PM on a Saturday, this was possible, but they are close-by and I took a chance.  When I got there I found the store open, empty except for the salesgirl, who was staring out the front window while the phone rang off the hook.  When I asked why she didn't answer the phone she got snotty.  Then when I asked for the product she said "This store doesn't carry that stuff".  I left with no purchase and a vow I will not return here!NOTE**
This review is only for the Pharmacy.

Been here to this pharmacy a couple of times because it's closer to my house when i needed it. I always get the same rude customer service with pharmacy technicians. One time i was here, my bf dropped his prescription for his eyes that needs to be taken non-stop daily. The pharmtechs told us to come back the next day after they call us.
So we actually received 3 calls from them telling us to come back and pick the medicines up.
So we came back the same day we received the calls only to find out that their pharmacy's computer system was down. And waited a good hour and it wasn't fixed still. We had to go because my bf has to work.
We went back the next day to finally pick it up at exactly 9am (pharmacy opens) and they were still closed. There was a long line waiting for them and they opened 10min after. Guess what?! It wasn't ready yet!! And then their bitchy pharmtech girl was staring at us with a WTF look and said "well you gotta talk to the pharmacist, there's nothing we can do about it." Well she needs to figure it out. She is totally LACKING customer service. It was early in the morning and she was trying to ruin it. What if i had a heart problem and i need my medication right away?! Gah. This place is giving us too much hassle. DEF NOT GOING BACK HERE, and i don't recommend it to people too.I've eaten here a number of times and the food is average, but the service has been pretty good each time. This is a chain and they do not care one bit about the staff - didnt they even go so far as to say because of Obamacare they will cut back on staff hours so they don't have to provide health insurance?  Because of their treatment of Chelsea the fired waitress and way they treat their employees, I will never go to an Applebee's again.PUBLIC alert!!!  Please read...
When i crave for Chinese food i always go Cheng's.  I dont know how many time they changed management, i wanted to share with my horrible experience.  I ordered catering for my guests for a total of $200+, this was done over the phone.  Listen to this, Carol the owner took my order and asked for my full name, address, card number, expiration including the security code. April 29 my food was delivered. The delivery guy asked to see my debit card and ID. He did this manually by tracing my card so it will reflect  on the credit card form. He was very nice and gave him a tip of $20.  He has all my information. Next day i checked my bank statement online and there was these UNAUTHORIZED transactions totaling to $500+.  First thing that came into my mind is Cheng's involved, either that delivery kid or anyone from cheng's...they have all my card info, who else could it be.  As of today, im still debating that with my bank!
Please donot buy food here anymore if you are paying by card...food is not that good anymore!!!! Oh, thanks for the donuts, thats the only one that is good.I still don't  understand how Pizza Hut is still open!   Between the ore-fab cardboard known as a crust, the bland sauce and low quality ingredients I would have to be coming off a long fast to eat it... And then I would probably throw it up!

There are a lot of frozen pizzas that are better!This hotel is so outdated. so you know the saying "you get what you pay for?" We'll that's definitely Hooters guidelines. 
Went with friends for a quick gateway and decided to go cheap on our rooms. Big mistake. Minutes after getting settled we had to request a new room. Bathroom sink was so backed up it smelt like a broken sewage pipe. *barf* 
"sorry for the inconvenient but we're going to have to give you an evening shitty room".. Is basically what happened. 
After traveling for 4hours this was the last thing I wanted to deal with. 
No refrigerators in rooms. That's an extra $25 p/n. AC is really loud and rattles. Old school tube television. My friend even got stuck in the elevator. Lol that was actually funny because she was totally buzzed and had a Final Destination moment. 
RUNDOWN hotel. For sure. 
24 hour pool hours but mainley occupied by kids. 
Customer service: horrible! Staff at the front desk are extremely rude. In short: Don't do it!!!!!! If you have afford paying a few more dollars, do so!
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNEDI've never had a dinner that didn't suck at Tutto. The food is just terrible, the service even worse, and the biggest slap in the face is that you have to pay a fucking premium for this. I've had better Italian food at Za's, and they're not bullshitting me by pretending to be fancy while serving me pasta that was made by a stoned idiot on minimum wage.

The pasta always manages to come out undercooked, and the sauces/seasonings taste like they're straight out of the can. I was once served a ladle-full of lumpy mashed rice pudding, and they had the nerve to tell me it was a risotto. A stomachache-inducing pile of shit is what it was. The waiters always end up being inattentive and slow, ignoring refills so they can spend more time chatting in the back. They have more than enough staff to handle their capacity. 

The bar at the front is nice, but ludicrously expensive for no good reason. The rest of the restaurant is an overpacked shitshow. If someone is sitting at the table behind you, prepare for a very uncomfortable dinner with a lot of accidental bumping.

This place reminds me of an Italian restaurant I used to work in, where we would just scrap together the nastiest old ingredients we could using plenty of microwaves and canned tomato paste. Nobody was truly good at or cared about their job, except the manager who seemed pretty capable of convincing the general public that his garbage was actual Italian food. The food tastes just the same.

Really, I was willing to give Tutto a chance. I came back more than once despite repeated lousy dinners. And all I've found is that they're just consistently bad.I had been looking forward to trying this steak house for a year; however, I won't be returning.  First, we were seated at a 2 top table near the entry of the room.  No table should be placed here, so servers and diners kept nearly running us over.  It made for many disruptions.  

The really upsetting factor was the service.  We waited for 20 minutes to receive our beverages.  We waited another 20 minutes to receive the soup course.  The same occurred with the entrees.  There were never apologies from the server.  

My husband and I ordered the filets prepared medium.  Mine was well done, and his was medium - well to well done.  Since I had learned they moved so slowly there, I just forced it down.  It was very tough.  I also had an order of steak fries.  I'm convinced they were the pre-frozen Ore-Ida kind.  They were burnt and had absolutely no seasoning, not even salt.  I have digestive issues, so they would have been hard for me to digest.  I explained this to the server and asked for a batch that wasn't quite over-cooked.  She came back 20 minutes later with an identical set and said that if they cooked them any less the would be too cold in the middle.  This reinforced my belief they were frozen.  I make steak fries at home all the time, and you can do so without making them burnt to a crisp if they are actually fresh cut.  With the price of the meal, they should use fresh-cut fries.  My husband isn't picky at all, but even he said there was no point in wasting the calories to eat them because they were bland and too hard.

When the check arrived I was shocked she had charged me for the steak fries, even after I communicated I probably wouldn't be able to eat the new batch either.  Also, I had ordered lemonade and realized that for my  2 lemonades ( I ordered a refill), I was charged $2 per lemonade.  I was never told there was not a free refill.  Also, the small glass was 90% ice each time.  My husband was also charged a $1.50 up charge for ordering french onion soup even though the menu said that all entrees come with  "choice of soup or salad & vegetable."  When he pointed this out, the server did take it off the bill for us, but confirmed they do charge an up-charge.  She didn't explain why that wasn't on the menu.

We will not be returning.  We get much better service at Flemings for the same price.  I had high expectations for this old time supper club that is locally owned, but I was sadly disappointed.  It put a damper on our Valentine's Day celebration...One word... cockroaches.Well after 2 years of loyal patronage and referals to this place I've given up.  It takes days to get your car in for service, then they have it for a few days so for repairs that need to be made in order to operate the car, it sucks.  Then the tranny went out on my Jetta and they said it was too expensive to fix, the car wasn't worth it (no arguement there).  I asked if they would like to buy it as they service almost exclusively VW's, they said no, not interested.  I'm super busy and they said to sign it over and they would tow it.  2 months later they still have it and are pulling it apart for parts.  Sketchy, um I drive by everyday, I know what you're doing.  When you KNOW a mechanic lies, don't go there.  Ben's VW and Prairie Fire are better, cheaper and more honest.just say no.

this place is truly awful. 
too bad it's taking up valuable space on monroe.Bad food overall. Egg flower soup looks like it's been recooked for lost of time. I ordered a very basic sing high fried rice and it's so plain and has no taste. The color of the rice make me wonder what kind of cheap cooking sauce they've been using. I will not recommend this place to anyoneThis review is for the central location not the Scottsdale location.  I have been to this establishment several times and have not had a good experience yet, but I kept giving them the benefit of the doubt, but last night was the final straw...  One time I went to the establishment to have some of their Red Velvet Cake, before ordering the cake I asked the rude waitress if they had some cake before I even ordered dinner, she replied yes, and guess what after dinner I ordered some Red Velvet Cake for the table and she informed me that they were out and she was sorry, Really!!!!!!   Last night i dropped by and was going to get some Cake for the house and now I guess that they do not do orders to go, just 1 slice of cake really, they are to busy to box up 1 slice of cake.  If you want to have chicken and waffles just go and take the trip to Scottsdale/Thomas southeast corner, no rude waiters and waitress' and the best of customer service.......I have to say, I have always had a good impression of Halo, even though I have never used their services.  In June, I decided that I wanted to go get both of my ears pierced, so I went to Halo because it was the first piercing joint that came to mind. I thought surely they would do just a regular ear piercing, even if it was probably going to be significantly more expensive than the mall. Well, I was wrong. I spoke with this guy at the counter who proceeded to tell me that the shop doesn't pierce with studs. The conversation went something like this:

Me: Why?
Pin Cushion: Stud earrings don't exist that meet our strict guidelines.
Me: What? (as I look in the case and see studs) Really?
Pin Cushion: We only pierce with surgical steel hoops or rods, the APA doesn't allow us to use inferior quality studs.
Me: Really? Oh no, so you're saying I have to go to the mall?
Pin Cushion: I wouldn't recommend anyone go to the mall. Did you know that they can't guarantee every single piece of the piercing gun is sterile?
Me: Huh?
Pin Cushion: Yeah but if you want to whatever, I understand your situation. It's not rocket science, a 16 year old at Claire's can do it for you.
Me: Ok...
Pin Cushion: But you know it will take 3-4 months to heal, and it isn't sterile.
Me: Um...
Pin Cushion: Have you seen the training video for the piercing guns? They have kids doing it.
Me: No, I haven't...
Pin Cushion: I can pierce you with some hoops and you can take them out in 6 weeks and put studs in if that's what you really want.
Me: Ok um, bye...

So I was really frustrated, because now I was gonna have to go to a pink and sparkly store with kids hopping all around to get my ears pierced, in that chair right behind the window for onlookers to see. But I was definitely going to go there now, if not just to spite this guy who got all snooty with me over his marginally superior piercing methods.

Bottom line, if they can't pierce with studs then they can't pierce with studs.  But his attitude over the whole thing left a very sour taste in my mouth, and I don't think I'd ever go back to get anything else pierced.  He was very snooty and condescending about the whole thing, and went out of his way to scare the bejeezus out of me about going to the mall, which I think was unnecessary.Some of the worst food I've had, period. I placed an order for delivery: cashew chicken with white rice, fried wontons, and egg drop soup. The whole order cost around $13 with free delivery. The lady on the phone was nice and the delivery guy seemed alright, too.

Once I received my food, I was severely disappointed. It was greasy and most of the food was cold. I started with the wontons, which had zero filling and the accompanying sauce had the consistency of jelly. So I put that aside for the egg drop soup. The soup was yellow, thick, and cold. It pretty much looked like they just whisked a bunch of egg yolks and called it a day. I hoped the chicken entree was at least partially decent, but I was again disappointed. The chicken AND the cashews were soggy (how does one make soggy cashews? I've never encountered this before), while the rice that came with it was cold and hard. Ugh, everything was thrown out and I ended up eating a peanut butter sandwich for dinner.Food is ok for the price but they charge additional money for using the card meaning they do not want the patrons to use a card. The cost to use card is less than 1 percent of your total bill so I am a little baffled as to why they do not want people to use cards. Be sure you ask for a receipt with the food details and not just the card receipt.Went in after along day of work to get a good pizza.. After watching the employees eat food with their fingers and not washing their hands after turned me off.. But thats not it..they had their own drinks on the same counter where the pizza crust lays..who knows what is on the bottom of those cups.. Dont even want to give them a star..so gross waste of 25 dollars cause we threw the pizza  away..The absolute worst Denny's ever. I have given them multiple chances, Bc they are so close to me but every time I go there I have to wait an hour plus for food.  The manager is a jerk that only gives excuses and then gets mad when you leave.Let me first start by saying the mole enchiladas were yummy,  The server was adorable, and the chips were great!

Now the bad: My family is vegetarian with the exception of me.  After constant assurances there was no lard or pork fat in the beans we ordered chips salsa, a veggie burrito and the fish tacos.  Both my wife and daughter (the veggies) became violently ill on the way home.  The server claimed there was only peanut oil in the beans which we believe to be suspect.  In addition, all of their salsas, with the exception of the habanero have chicken stock.

Bottom line: cute place, nice atmosphere, not going back.  Not putting lard in products does not make them vegetarian.  What a rough night.This place is the worst.  Playing pool and drinking beer and the waitress told us if we wanted a glass of water we could pay for a bottle of water or use the drinking fountain.  WTF.  This place should be avoided at all costs.I just want to complain the guy who came for  --- supposed to be ---  "service." He was rude from the beginning, as not listened to me, or communicate me (from the beginning - I know everything and you don't know anything attitude).  I explain why I want to change the tire (I do not feel safe to drive & handle is heavy) but he did not change. He was rude and not explain well why he did not change.  SO, I would like to complain his attitude and tried to write down the name and ID#.  He hide the ID in the pocket. I tried to see the number and tried to pulled the ID from the pocket, he shouted at me "DON'T TOUCH ME," even I do not touch him at all. He states "YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GONNA CHANGE THE TIRE & I CALL BOSS.  Why did he need to hide the ID?... I believe if he did nothing wrong, he can show me his ID. I called the dispatch and complained his attitude. He also called the company to complain about me with the twisted story, such as "she grabbed me," "she said -  do not change the tire," but no word about I was trying to see his ID. Dispatcher told me to let him changed the tire and wanted to talk to him. I passed my phone to him and he complains me about again lot of lie to protect him.  Besides, he states to the dispatcher "put a note that this customer is rude" in front of me.  I used more than a couple times AAA road service but never had this kind of rude guy. I've never complain their service even waiting for a long time under AZ heat in the summer (one time I waited for 2 hours).  I liked the service before but anymore. He was totally jerk.So I went to eat here tonight with my hubby and we got the 2 for $20. He got the chicken crispers with buffalo sauce & I got the chicken fajitas. Well when the food came I noticed that my chicken looked a little weird. As I cut into the chicken it didn't cut like normal chicken. I took a bit & it tasted spongy; the texture and taste were really gross. So I asked my husband about his chicken & he said it was also weird. Needless to say we both could not eat it. Now we have been to this chilies before & we always get some kind of chicken dish and we have never had this problem. I asked the server if they changed their chicken & she said no. But something was definitely off. Here's my tip to you, if you go here do not get anything with chicken breast. I'm not sure if they changed vendors or what, but the chicken has definitely changed.Beyond disappointed. I'd give this zero stars if I could. I now know why these are going out of business. Food isn't fresh at all. Especially the salad I received. There shouldn't be any rotten greens in a salad. Ever! More black leaves then green leaves. Wow this is straight up common sense. Didn't see anyone being served moldy flatbread but I would put it past this joint. Won't be back... EVER!Don't eat here unless you want to become violently ill.  My boyfriend made the mistake of eating the salsa that was sitting out on the table.  Now I have the joy of taking care of him because he has a really bad case of food poisoning as a result.  Great way to ruin a vacation.Decided to order a pizza and saw a pizza hut commercial so thought yea I'll give it a try since I had not had pizza hut in ages!!!!! Called in to place my order and the women who answered the phone "Gullian" or something like that, was the rudest and probably had the worst customer service that I have ever experienced! When I asked what my crust options were again she paused took a deep breath as if she was irritated with me asking for the options of the pizza I am going to pay for. She got loud and rude so I  let it slip but by the second time when I asked how many topings she raised her voice and began to yell out the answer.  That is just uncalled for and disrespectful to customers. When I called back to ask for the manager she claimed to be the manager. If this place is ran by people like this, I want no part of it! Took my money to papa johns and enjoyed their friendly upbeat service.  Thanks pizza hut for that awful experience I will probably never be trying pizza hut ever again.I love sushi.  The sushi at this place? Expensive and its not especially worth the high price.  There are so many good sushi places in the valley.  The sushi tastes old and falls apart when you pick it up with your chop stix (BoOO).  The miso soup seems like its from a dry mix. 

There are a few sushi places in town that are better quality and better prices. AKA fresher fish, better ingredients, and superior preparation.

Try: Sushi Creek:  If you don't mind a drive.  Very fresh, very well done.
        Mido:  Authentic little place with fast service and great prices.
         Koi:  Nice place to party and have sushi with friends (has now replaced Sushi    101 in my heart).Alright.  Ready for my two cents?  My client told me about this place not to long ago.  She knows how I am about pizza ;)) well anyways.  I came across a Groupon for it. I was ecstatic!!!!!!!! 
My boyfriend and I went for date night. Right when we walked in, we got sat down right away. BUT 15 minutes later,  our waiter was no where to be found nor knew who was our waiter. I had to ask who our waiter was. One, she didn't speak English nor I can comprehend. Two, she kept smiling at me when I was talking to her,  she didn't listen to what I say.  honestly, whenever I had a question or command something,  I had to ask TWICE!!! Smh. 
These couple came in 30 minutes after us, THEY GOT THEIR FOOD BEFORE US. I confronted the manager, he did not care, he said don't worry.  It'll come out.. wtf are you serious?  


And, Whatttt? No hot sauce or ranch? Yeah. I was bummed out.

Overall. Horrible customer service. But I love my pizza .So my wife and I had tickets to the 10pm show this past Saturday. There was some miscommunication with the couple that we were suppose to meet, they showed up to the 8pm show (even though our texts to them said 10pm), said they were let in at a discounted price. We were speaking with security and he was talking with the owner to try and get a resolution. When the other couple came out of the show and the situation became known, the other couple was given a refund of their money (After they've already seen the show) and was told they could come to the 10pm show. We ended up not going due to the bad taste and experience we had over these tickets. 

I'm perfectly find being out the $30 dollars for the 2 tickets for my wife and I, but the biggest insult is the fact that the owner refunded the money of the other couple and invited them back to the 10pm show. My wife sent an email to the club on Saturday night, but we still have not gotten a response back. 

Based on our bad experience dealing with the club I do not think it is a place we will attempt to visit again and probably wont recommend to our friends. Since the other couple are friends of my wife, I'm not sure what they are doing to work out this situation. 

This post is mainly about the insult we felt when the owner refunded the money of the other couple after they've already seen the show instead of refunding us at least their portion of the tickets we purchased for the 10pm show.I have frequented this restaurant over many years, including bringing large private parties for dinner. Food was always exceptional. Today, was a major disappointment. My son, husband and I had brunch/lunch. Food took quite awhile, and when it arrived was barely warm. Son had waffles with fried chicken. Bourbon maple butter had no bourbon or maple flavor. I had buffalo style shrimp with blue cheese grits. Looked more like an app than entree. Shrimp ok, grits cold with no blue cheese flavor. Husbands chicken wrap was boring and uninspired. Sad to see such a great restaurant go downhill.The first time I ate here last year I would have given them 5 stars, but tonight they got 1 star for the following reasons.

1. It took over an hour to get our appetizer and food.  Our appetizer came out only moments before our food.
2. It took another 45 mins to get our check and leave
3. The waiter barely touched our table

The only plus is that complaining to the manager is that we got our appetizer comped.

Needless to say we're never coming back.Its official. Neiman Marcus is in a horrible slump in men's fashion. Sure you can get a nice suit, but where can't you. They never have any decent designers no matter how many times you suggest it to the managers. Every walk into the men's section is a slap of midlife crisis in your face. just nasty.My mom and I were drawn in by the reasonably priced lunch menu and convenient location- but we quickly discovered that the reasonable menu equated terrible food.  The lunch menu is priced so reasonably ($5-$8 for a complete bento box) that I worried about the quality of the food as we placed our order.  My mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box.  Neither of us liked the salad dressing (too much ginger), although people who like ginger will probably enjoy it.  I literally had to spit out my first bite of sashimi (tuna).  It was the most fishy and rough piece of fish I've ever tasted.  It was absolutely atrocious and the flavor remained in my mouth long after i spit it out.  After that first bite, I decided against trying the other sashimi out of concern that I would get sick.  My mom's chicken was also terrible- she described it as tough and over cooked.  We politely told the waitress (an older lady, possibly the owner) that we were both unable to eat our meals.  She rudely informed me that the fish was fresh and there was nothing wrong with it.  (note: if that is what they consider fresh fish, then their standards are VERY low).  I apologized and told her that I was unable to eat it.  She grabbed the plate away, but refused to take my mother's food (stating that there was nothing wrong with the chicken).  Another waitress came by and we explained the situation to her.  She was very nice and apologized, and my mom and I left the restaurant.  The food was so atrocious that we literally left without eating!This is another place that I figured I would have wrote the first review of...unfortunately, it seems this place is so bad that someone else beat me to it.

I brought in a simple Fossil watch with a dead battery and asked how much it would cost to be repaired.  The man working there told me it would cost 10 dollars for a new battery but the rubber gasket which makes the watch water resistant would need to be replaced as well and that would cost another 7 dollars.  I agreed to the extra charge and left the watch with them.  While I was walking through the mall, I happened to realize there was a Fossil store there.  I walked into browse a little.  A very nice employee asked if I needed anything, I was just curious...so I asked if they replaced batteries for their watches there.  He said yes and told me it would be 8 or 9 dollars depending on the model and type of battery.

I immediately realized I had been ripped off by Fast Fix but wasn't too upset because I figured it was my fault for not researching the Fossil store from the beginning.  Yet, when I returned to Fast Fix to pick up my watch, they still weren't done with it...I had been gone for over an hour.  After standing there for 5 minutes, the male employee loudly smashed the back cover back on and handed it to a female employee who looked it over and smashed it again for good measure(?).

I reluctantly paid for the new battery and was about to put the watch on when I noticed a medium size scuff on the face of the watch and dozens of tiny scratches in the back cover.  This really made me upset and I mentioned it.  My comments were met with annoyed silence...to which I pointed out that they had over charged me, citing the price given to me by the Fossil store.  The male employee stood up and yelled at me for 5 minutes about while their prices might be higher - it is because they take greater care of the watches and use higher quality batteries...he also strangely added that he takes "all the liability and risk" of damage which also increases his costs.  I pointed out that they had - in fact - damaged my watch but made no offer to compensate me for the damage.  He told me I should have thought about that before I came in the store and pointed to the "No Refunds" sign.

I told him to have a nice day and walked out - only to look at the watch and realize they hadn't even done me the favor of resetting the watch to the correct date and time.  I don't live in Arizona anymore but even if I did, I would never go to another one of these stores again - and especially not this one.  Take your watches somewhere else and save some money and a huge hassle...you might also prevent damage to your property.NYPD claims to taste like NY pizza because they use "Yonkers water" in their dough.  I grew up in Yonkers. My benchmark is Carlo's Pizza at the corner of Central Avenue and Tuckahoe Rd.  That is my neighborhood.  Yonkers wins the NY State water flavor championship on a yearly basis, so to make such a claim piqued my interest.   NYPD is some of the worst pizza I've ever had in my lifetime.  

We ordered pizza with tomatoes on top.  When I picked up the pizza and brought it home, I realized that the tomatoes were stale.  Yes they gave me a refund, but anyplace that serves pizza with stale toppings isn't worth my time.  I've never eaten there since.

If you want authentic NY Pizza forget NYPD and go to Ray's at the corner of Pima and Frank Lloyd Right.This place is a joke. I have reported to our insurance company for fraud. They billed us for lenses we didn't get and also charged our insurance company for a contact lens fitting we paid out of pocket for. Save yourself the time and hassle. I've been working with our insurance company to get this rectified, but honestly, what a mess.  I will say the exam was thorough, but it did take a long time (4+ hours for two of us). It's safe to say we'll be staying far far away from this place.My head is steaming with anger fumes because I just paid $148 to Molly Maid to clean my tiny 1,000 sq ft house.
 Ok I know, "just clean it yourself" you're right, I typically like to do my own cleaning. Sweeping, mopping ,vaccum, laundry, dusting, etc. and I have had my house professionally cleaned twice, i'm young so I can do it myself, plus it is most of the time relaxing but listen, my mother in law is coming into town tomorrow, i'm pregnant, and I need a thorough cleaning without my 2 year old trying to help, or not trying to help!
 I called Molly Maid for a quote. On the phone the lady told me for the first initial cleaning it was to be $74-$148 for 1-2 hours. I thought, that's expensive so let me consult with my husband and I'll call you back. Very nicely she offered to call me with in a week to schedule an appointment. When they called me back the next week, my house had only dirtied more and the countdown until my Mother-in-law is drawing closer. The lady I spoke to then offered for someone to come out and do an estimate on my house because "oh, yeah, it will be SO MUCH MORE less expensive if they come out to estimate your house"
 Kurt came over. Nice dude. Showed me his card, I showed him around he asked if I had any special requests in any of the rooms otherwise they would do their standard cleaning. I requested to have them clean underneath the couch because the dust is visible to the eye when you walk into the door and food that my two year old has thrown is also lingering. "No Problem" We proceeded into the bedroom and Kurt explained to me that as a courtesy if I put my clothes on the bed, the two ladies coming into the house would fold the clothes. Perfect, I thought.
 Kurt then sat down and wrote down an estimate." $74-$148 for 1-2 hours"
 I explained to him that the  lady said it would be less expensive, he looked confused. NO COMMUNICATION between front of house and back of house, obviously. Ok so thanks for caking up your service to me and wasting my time, I could've just made the appointment with the lady on the phone if you were going to tell me the price was the same as she had explained
 The ladies came today. Arrived at 8:30. Both REALLY nice, they started in the bedroom, and seemed to be working pretty hard, one of the ladies mentioned how she can't stop sweating, so I thought, ok she's doing her cleaning thing! She even pulled out the couch! I was so excited I wasn't going to have to see dust. To keep my toddler from playing with all of the cleaning supplies we ran a couple errands. Came back to the house, the bedroom they started in looked great but the two loads of laundry I had on the bed weren't folded, bummer!
 It was 10:30 and they hadn't swept or mopped the living room or kitchen.(The main part of the house)  The ladies apologized after I got a call from Kurt explaining they were going overtime, no problem except for the fact that I had arranged to have $148 for the ladies as the receptionist and Kurt had both confirmed the price would be. I told them I'd be paying cash so I got the correct cash. Once again no communication. Kurt said it was ok and that the next time they clean I could pay for overtime then.
Mason (my two year old) and I went into the bedroom and started folding the laundry. 10 minutes later I have a knock on the bedroom door. "We're finished" The couch is moved back in and I see the same dust and food that had been sitting there before. "You cleaned behind the couch when you pulled it out right?" "yes!" Ok, visibly this is not true. I look at the floors as one of the ladies is arguing on the phone with the receptionist. There are sneaker tread marks in the kitchen and living room still.
I paid $148 and the nice ladies left, but my floors are still gross, they were in to big of a rush to do as thorough of a job as they did my bedroom and shower. I end up, at 5 months pregnant pulling my couch back out, sweeping behind the couch, and swiffering everything they had just swept! my socks are off, I go into the laundry room to put the Swiffer away, they had not vacuumed or swept the laundry room and I tread dirt from my feet back into the living room. I am so tired, my son and I are both hungry, and i'm trying not to cry because I just paid $148 to a cleaning. The main rooms that we would entertain my mother in law in are not clean!  No Bueno, i'm tired now, that is my review!OVERRATED, you can stop reading now that all you need to know.

The food here is completely overrated. I think it's one of those local, established places that maybe had good food at one point, but then got lazy and sloppy in the kitchen. And now locals can't stop raving about it because it's the cool thing to do. Don't listen to that. I've been here a number of times and tired different things and for the most part it is bland a greasy. Especially the beer bread. Also this location has a way of making you feel awkward and unwanted at the door. There is always 4-5 hostesses and bouncers sitting at the front talking and laughing amongst themselves when you walk up. None of which seem to want to take their eyes away from twitter long enough to help you. And the bouncers always have a serious authority complex. And finally it's kind of out of the way, so forget about hailing a cab after a few beers, which aren't bad, but you can get them at any restaurant in the state. Save yourself the trouble and your business elsewhere.This hotel is as awful as it gets. My stay at this hotel was terrible and the worst part was knowing what a profit they made off my stay. The hotel staff is really unprofessional and don't even understand the checking in process. The room was $109! I checked out the next morning and went to Fiesta Resort (5 stars--free wi-fi) for $72.

Here are a list of things wrong with this hotel and my room:
* Shower tub was clogged (I should have been given a discount for this)
* Bathroom towels were old and smelled like chlorine
* Air conditioner smells each time it automatically turns on
* Beds are uncomfortable and never seem to be rotated
* Carpet is stained
* Decor is from the 70s
* Bathroom is cramped
* Accordian-style bathroom mirror was missing the mirror
* Hair dryer barely worked
* Remote only works from ~6 feet away from the TV
* TV gets terrible reception
* Hangars cannot be removed from the closet track
* Sliding glass door couldn't be opened
* Shower nozzle is small, corroded, and cheap ($8 nozzle)
* They charge for wi-fi
* Hotel has stains on the side of the building
* The hotel staff

it's a rip-off. Stay away from here! It needs to go out of business and be bought by a company that will renovate it.Driver had a really bad attitude. The apartment number was wrong and she asked "Sooo did you just enter it wrong or what?" Then she kept me on the phone without talking while she trudged over to my apartment. I apologized for the mix up and she said nothing. The most interaction she had with me at the door, was to ask if this was my credit card?  I still tipped her because I've been a server before, but thinking back maybe I should not have. I would never have been so rude to a customer. The pizza tasted pretty good, but I already had a bad taste in my mouth. Next time I will order from Papa John's or one of the 10 other pizza places near ASU.Had a simple salad... Butter lettuce, walnuts literally that's it with salmon. Something like $12 for it and it literally looked and tasted like they just threw the items on the plate. No tossing or arranging or anything. At least the lettuce was washed. The salmon tasted frozen and had huge peppercorns crusted onto the top... I was hungry so I ate it but was not happy at all this was their idea of a $12 salad. My boyfriend had the adriattico boa? I think that's what it was and said the tomato cream tasted like the vodka sauce from Safeway... Cafe Boa used to be good, now not so much.  I think it's lost it's luster and they have a lot of nerve charging the prices they do for mediocre food. Probably won't eat there again.Didn't actually play here. We tried to, the pro was a jerk and service was terrible. Save the hassle and go play Coronado down the street. Same dive golf course, friendlier, and cheaper tooI'm beginning to think Yelpers in Arizona have been so deprived of good ethnic food that they think every mediocre hole in the wall is worthy of 4-5 stars. On the plus side, the owner is a kindly old gent, my waiter was very attentive, and their prices are low.  Unfortunately, the food (I had a chicken dish) was just really fair at best. The spare ribs were AWFUL and nothing at all like Chinese pork! The ribs were brown meat cooked in a salty brown sauce that tasted like eating burned pot roast and some parts were too tough to chew. The hot and sour soup was just lame, barely tangy and no pork thrown in for flavor. I really think Panda Express is a lot better than this.I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one. By the time I get to the register it's 10:30 and I am told I can't order breakfast even though I was in line before 10:30. The cashier let me order breakfast anyway - all I want is a McMuffin - and I proceed to wait twenty minutes to even get my order. I might have been able to forgive this considering there were two huge orders ahead of mine (Easter breakfast for the whole family, I guess) except my McMuffin was soggy, and my iced coffee was so stale I couldn't taste the flavored syrup in it. Worst of all, even after I got my food, I still had to wait for my coffee, because they had decided to make coffee for other orders first. You can be sure I will do my very best to never come here again.After this I was finally able to get him to set up an appt to do the touch up.  I go today to have it done, detoured through the parking lot of Fry's to see him loading up his grocerys about 5 minutes before my appt is supposed to start.  I head to the studio and wait for about 10 minutes and he's a total no show.  Absolutely ridiculous, I wouldn't refer anyone to this place in fact if I would advise against it!After my first poor experience, I called the vet who initially saw my pet Dr. Thomas. She would not give me a direct answer and told me she would write me an ongoing script for pain meds. I'm SO glad I went to another vet's office right down the street because that vet informed me your dog is REALLY sick. I would never ever set foot or recommend anyone who loves their animals like children to go here.This chinese restaraunt was overly priced, had horrible service, overall bad experience. I would recommend going to PF Changs or Pei Wei for the money.Ignored the reviews here. Went anyway. Now I regret it.After a trip to Hoover dam, the fam and I were starving, so we decided to check out this lunch buffet at Railroad Pass.  This was probably the worst mistake of the trip.  Yes, the buffet was only, seriously, $7/person, but I now understand why.  Ugh.

The theme of the buffet was "Asian" food, so I knew it wouldn't end well.  No one should really cook "Asian" food unless they are actually Asian.  (....and I'm pretty sure the chefs were there not of any sort of Asian descent.)  I lightly sampled some of the "safe" foods, like orange chicken, beef and broccoli, pot stickers and fried rice.  Mistakes.  All of them.  

I then opted for the sandwich bar and scarfed down some roast beef.  I left feeling pretty ill (like, really), so I'm not sure if I can attribute that feeling to the food or to sun poisoning.  Either way, I still can't bring myself to eat a roast beef sandwich without associating it with this buffet.  So, in conclusion, if you are starving and you pass this place, please keeeep on moving and get back to Vegas ASAP to enjoy a GOOD buffet.Disappointing. I first went here for an auto accident and I signed a form for cash payment. My insurance wasn't billed. For 3 months of treatment I was billed over $3000!!! I asked for a discount and fought to get 20%. 

My hubby then went & Dr Nash herself negotiates all pricing. She only charged him $350! And billed our insurance who also paid per visit. None of my EOBs seem correct & I know Ive overpaid!!

Never will Dr Nash get my referrals again.We were flying from vegas and the to phoenix and then denvet and then sioux falls. We were told we would have to get our last boarding pass in denver, they were not able to print it for us in las vegas, unless we payed more. Even though our tickets were already payed for. We knew we would not have enough time to get that done when we landed in denver,we wouldnt have enough time for all 5 of us toget tickets and go back through security. Then we were given the wrong gate number at las vegas airport and almost missed plane, not a good experience, luckily they know what their doing in phoenix, they helped us get boarding pssses. Not sure what the problem was seems like they wanted to getrid of us in stead of helping us. Worst airport ever.They seem to conveniently be out of compact cars every time I've been here.  They suck.Horrible place they're thieves! Was are regulars downtown and would always stay at the El Cortez (im talking twice a month) until I walked in to security in my room whom had stolen a personal item out of my overnight bag. I highly recommend not staying there stay at the 4queens the dont change a resort fee!Stayed at this hotel for a work trip because of the location and for the price. It looked like a pretty nice place, however, once I checked in and walked up to my room, I realized I was very wrong. Upon pulling down the sheets to jump into bed after a long day, I noticed that there was a giant blood stain all over my sheets. I called down to housekeeping to see if they could change it, and they laughed and said  "oh it's probably just a rust stain, but would have someone come up and look." Even if it was just rust..disgusting. After the woman came in to the room she noticed too that it was indeed not rust. How the person cleaning the room didn't notice this when changing the sheets will forever be a mystery to me. Who knows what else is not actually cleaned in this room. Highly suggest you think about staying somewhere else.When we checked in the ladies couldn't figure out the monthly rate so I paid for a week, the next morning I went down and paid for the rest of the month, the assistant manager was nice to give us the extra day that you would get if you paid a month at a time, at the end of the month when it was time to pay again the days got so mixed up from when I was initially told I needed to repay, the next morning on the day I was initially told we was suppose to repay a lady is banging on my door at 7:30am waking my 4 year old up.  I explain to them what happen and what I was told, one told me to wait and talk to the assistant manager when he got back in 2 days, but Here went the calls and the door banging. When I told them the other one said to wait and talk to assistant manager they said that will not happen and I need to pay now even though it was not the checkout day i was informed.  

You have to buy a card for 2.00 to use the washer and dryer, when you need to ad more money on to so laundry you can ad only 5,10,15 or 20$s you can't ad enough to do just the laundry you need to do and when you check out you have to send the card to a company in another state to get refunded the money you have remaining on the card.

To use the vacumn to keep there place nice you have to pay 1.00 each time and give them your id. Same thing with the iron and iron board. Anything they can make money on they will. Cash cow.

The Internet is a wopping 20.00 a month or 5.00 a week and most of the time since I have been here it hasn't worked 60% of time and the famous words of the office "no refunds" why am I paying for something I can't use???
The tv channel 13 don't come in and when it does it freezes and statics. All they say is they will call the cable company. Why don't they fix the problem the first time instead of running around the problem? I have seen the cable/Internet company out here more then not. I got irritated one night I needed the Internet for my college courses, I went over to the office to see what is wrong this time only to see the black lady tell the Internet repair person he had to wait some people just got on the computers in the office and signed up for 30 mins so he had to wait until they was off the computer. WTF.... If I was him I would of told her to call another company he is not on her time and other tenants need the internet now not later.

I do have something good to say. They have security that do not his out until end of shift.  They are out there and visible to anyone that think they are going to cause problems. 
The property is kept clean and quiet for the most part. That was surprising to me.I was only willing to try this out because my roommate wanted sushi and Goyemon was a 1 hour wait. Honestly, I would have walked out as soon as I stepped in but my roommate and her friend wanted sushi asap. When you walk in, it feels like they bought the location from a Mexican restaurant and never changed the decor or the plating. The menus were dirty and I didnt see any asian customers inside. (I judge a good asian restaurant by how many asians are dining at their location.) I saw every ethnicity but asian! I knew I was in trouble lol. All I ordered was one California roll and it wasn't good at all. Probably the worst California roll I've ever had. Worse than the ones you buy prepackaged at the grocery store. EPIC NOM NOM FAIL!!!!!!!!!! If you like sushi, don't come here.I am genuinely the most easiest person to please. I always drove past this location and asked myself, "Why have I NOT tried this place yet?" 
 
We stood in line waiting to order and there was this elderly women in front of us who obviously was trying her best to take an order being it was her first time too, the cashier lady immediately got frustrated and scold the lady to pick up the tone of her voice because she couldn't hear her order.  
If that wasn't rude enough a drive thru asked for her assistants and she snapped at them telling them that she's occupied, "Hold Up!"

Then it was my turn to order. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and did my best to order... I decided on a medium burger, and she rudely told me... "you mean the beef medium burger?" Long story short because I don't want to write an essay...

If she didn't love her job find a new one... or if she was having a bad day? Take a moment to go and breath. There should be no reason for her to mistreat her guest. Especially when you never know who that guest could be. 

Food came out, we noticed she missed a lot of things we requested.... disappointed because the food was actually tastey.Being a native New Englander from a fishing family with a birthday coinciding on Monday, I had a tremendous craving for a Maine lobster. Off I went and entered Red Lobster at around 8 PM Saturday. The place was a graveyard. 

I was seated immediately and asked if I was ready to order. I told the server I'd like a moment to peruse the menu but I really wanted a Maine lobster. Laughing, the server pointed to the empty lobster tank. How does a restaurant run out of it's signature product on a weekend? He told me he'd bring me some biscuits and left.

When the server returned,  I ordered the stuffed mushrooms, the lobster bisque and the Bar Harbor Lobster Bake. I was not asked if I wanted to order drinks or dessert. The server promised biscuits again, and left.

The server returned with, alas, without the biscuits, but the stuffed mushroom appetizer. The server cautioned me the dish was extremely hot, He promised to bring me biscuits again, and left. I gave the food some time to cool and let the flavors settle. The appetizer was quite delightful. However, I apparently waited to long.

The remaining courses began to arrive in rapid succession, literally piling up on the table. I was flummoxed as the was restaurant was nearly empty. I was promised biscuits each time the server came, but alas! Those biscuits and I had paths that were apparently never meant to cross.

The other problem that was nearly comical is that by the time I got to each dish in succession, it had cooled to the point of dissatisfaction. The lobster bisque had congealed. The main course should have been called the Bar Harbor Linguine Cover with a dash of Seafood. A smaller portion of pasta would have better allowed one to savor the flavors of the seafood and the accompanying sauces. 

Incidentally, the food presentation reminded me of something you would see in a hospital., The main course was covered in a plastic container and made me feel like I was in an assisted living facility.

At the end, the server came back with a check (about 45 dollars), and asked me if I would like to take some biscuits on takeaway. Anyone who has eaten a cold biscuit probably can guess why I refused this offer. And who knows, perhaps I'd still be sitting there, waiting...

I can see that many people enjoy this place. I heartily recommend spending one's money elsewhere. The salesmanship, service, food preparation, and quality leave much to be desired. I think had it been busy it may explain why they bring the food so quickly. One may not notice.Over priced Timeshare.

Unfortunately - I am one of the poor owners of this piece of crap. They charge terribly high maintenance fee and the exchange resorts are booked decades in advance. I wish we hadnt fallen to their sales pitch 10 years ago !This place is raunchy, smelly, dirty and loud.
Avoid it at all cost!
The armpit of Las Vegas.I stayed here over the weekend because i had friends flying in from the east coast who already booked a few rooms, and it was cheap. The non renovated rooms are a joke.  I would rather bring a sleeping bag and sleep on one of those overpass crosswalks listening to some lady say "water for a dollar" all night.  The renovated rooms are nicer and good if you don't plan on spending any time in the room other than sleeping and showering (like me).  The pool scene was pretty sad.  I watched a gang fight almost break out by the elevators.  Hotel Management was not friendly and useless resolving an issue with our room keys. The only food we found was fast food and needed to walk to the Luxor to get something decent to eat.  They also charge a $14 per day "resort fee" when you check out.  Excalibur, not a fan.WOW.....I have never seen worse customer service. They clearly don't stand by thier merchandise or care about how they treat there customers. Called them to get a hardly worn pair of shoes fixed. They seemed extremely bothered when over a week later I called them to find out the whereabouts of my $100 shoes and what was happening to them. They were never sent out to be fixed and no one had called me. I ended up going in and taking them back. I got them fixed else where and with a lot less attitude. Shop there but once they have your money, don't expect them to help you any further!Wow, I've eaten here in the past and liked it. Went back recently and I have to say we (table of 6) had the worst service I've ever had hands down. Everyone at the table was looking around to see if maybe we were on candid camera or something it was that bad.This is for the "Theme Park" as a whole but specifically the RV Park.  As other yelpers have said, if I could give Circus Circus zero stars I would.

On a road trip one summer with our RV we decided that we would swing through Vegas on our way home.  We wanted to stay in an RV park near the action on the Strip and to our surprise we found that Circus Circus has an RV park on site.  Sweet!  Let's do it.  Oh my GOD what a mistake that was!  Mind you, we were on the last leg of a cross country road trip with two kids and two dogs, so we were already sort of at our wits end, but nothing prepared us for what we were in for during our stay at CC.  

The first afternoon we pulled in and, to our horror, found that the RV park is literally a parking lot with electrical and water hook ups.  Each "site" is a parking stall, with no area outside for putting chairs or even the smallest of barbeques.  There were a couple of "premium sites" with small patches of grass but for some unknown reason if you were travelling with dogs you were not allowed to have those spots.  Shade?  Non existent.  

Being the middle of summer we thought a dip in the pool might be refreshing.  Wrong.  Even the kids were disgusted.  

We ventured into the casino/circus tent to check out the action.  What a complete waste of space.  The casino is unorganized and dirty and the midway games for the kids are no better.   After having experienced what we did in the casino and midway there was no way in hell we were going to eat in any of the restaurants, so we took the quick walk across the street to the Sahara and hit up the Nascar cafe which was quite pleasant.

Night two at Circus Circus things went from bad to worse.  After a day of sight seeing on the strip we returned to our RV to find that a good portion of the RV parking lot had lost power, including the section that we were in.  Luckily we had boarded our dogs with a local veterinarian for the day so they were not left to bake in our RV for who knows how long between when the power went out and we returned.  We asked to be moved to a different site so we could fire up the A/C in the 113 degree heat (at 10:00 at night) which they reluctantly agreed to.  I guess it was around 12:30am when the space next to us became occupied by a couple of yahoo's who put the red in redneck.  They were whoopin and hollerin until they finally decided to hit the strip at about 2:00.  At which time their dogs began barking.  And barking.  And barking.  We complained, as did several other guests, but no one did anything about it.   At around 6:30am we decided we'd had enough and we packed it up and hit the road for home.  

Needless to say, if you are looking for an RV park in Vegas and you see the great ads for CC rv park on the strip run, don't walk, to the next RV park on the list.I stayed here with a few friends in the summer of 2010. Their power went out for hours on end and we weren't compensated in any way. Shit, an apology of some sort would have sufficed... Once it came back on, I tried taking a shower. The drain was clogged so I had to wade through my own chum. My friend later found the culprit... a condom was stuck in the drain. Tight. They still got those bronze statues of butts out front. Some more polished than others from people feeling up on them.I think if you stay there for free you're paying too much, another thing if you book 2 rooms together good luck you'll never get it in that place, and try to reason with the front desk and don't even bother asking for a manager to talk to, I think you better respect yourself a little bit more and go to a nicer hotelOoh.  Um... THE SUCK...

The few of us who somehow woke before noon walked about the Miracle Mile shops in search of some breakfast eats.  Unfortunately, we stumbled upon this joint and had too little mental acuity to give it a once over before deciding...

The decor and theme would be perfect if it were an outdoor restaurant, not so much under a faux sky in a darkened corner of a mall.

Service was responsive, though that probably had a lot to do with us being only the second party in the establishment.  Our server did comp me a grapefruit juice when it turned out that they weren't out...

But the menu.  Ech.  Not a one (of the four of us) were happy with our meals.  Yes, its primarily a seafood and wine bar, but REALLY?  How do you screw up AND be chintzy on breakfasts and salads?  I dare say, I've had better for cheaper at Denny's...Typical liars.  I just went through a painstaking process of choosing items from their online menu for delivery only to be told "we dont deliver"  I called them on their lie since they advertise that they do both online and on their website.  They even have an online delivery order tool.  I got pissed, telling them how much time I wasted trying to order vegan for a big party.  They admitted that they selectively didnt deliver tonight, then hung up on me.  False advertising. They deserve to lose business.I'm quite forgiving and usually will give a place a second chance, I truly regret that I gave this atrocious place another.

The food itself is fine.  the coconut shrimp and the ribs are always well done.  Their crab dip is also quite delightful, and you can easily be filled up on this stuff alone.

However when it comes to the MGM location, the star meter should be in the negatives strictly based on service alone.  Never have I been to a place where I've felt more neglected and treated so rudely.  This is the second time it's happened to me here and I'll never come to this location again.

Our story starts off with us getting seated next to a huge b-day party of fifteen.  Our hostess leaves telling us to enjoy our "safari".  Ten minutes go by and not a single "hello" or drink order from anyone.  I'm tipping over w/ rage at this point based upon my previous experience and immediately call upon my first manager.  I explained to her how time has gone by and we haven't been helped and she was shocked and took our order right away.

Now you'd think at this point the person that's supposed to be waiting on us would've come by to apologize at least.  If he did that all would be forgiven somewhat.  However he didn't.  In stead he acted like his mom just took away his TV privileges for a month and he slid our waters onto our table, tossed my dining card on the table and stormed off.  I had it at this point and was redder than their stupid sparkly thing they put on their volcano dessert.

Upon comes my request for manager #2.  I requested that our waiter be removed and replaced with a different one or we get reseated to a different section.  I even could've played the race card if I wanted to as it was clear our waiter didn't like Asians and would rather serve his own kind, but I let it be.  The manager was very apologetic and introduced us to our new waitress as the other manager came over with our appetizers.  At this point our original waiter came over and noticed both his bosses and another colleague were at our table and actually tried to come over and take the appetizer platter away from the manager and serve it to us.  Everyone kind of just looked at him stunned.  Needless to say I wasn't too pleased and voiced my opinion to have him removed from our presence immediately.  The managers shooed him away like you would any animal that came near your property.  

The service did get better at this point as Manager #2 was always within our line of sight and he kept a constant watch to make sure we were taken care of.  However this didn't make up for the delays and the neglect right off the start.

I admire the managers for taking control and making sure they did what they could to rectify a poor situation, however the bad service from our original waiter stems from above.  They should have a firmer grip on their staff and should make sure they hire people that know how to do a good job.

Food is a 3-star, however the experience ruins all aspects of it altogether.Terrible!! It wouldve gotten 0 stars if that was allowed.  Went there with my bf on an allegedly Jello Wrestling Sunday only to find this club to have very little going on.  Two girls wrestled in the inflatable pool for about 5 minutes and then that was all for the jello wrestling.  On the website they make you believe that jello wrestling is a big deal there on Sundays and then you get there and after the five minutes of jello wrestling the club is basically dead as a doornail. During the jello wrestling, there are no other girls on stage. After the wrestling, there is 1 girl on stage and the others walking around the club soliciting dances. The club was not the Deja of yesteryear. My bf  had been there about 4 years ago and it was crazy and much wilder, with way better looking girls. These girls were nothing to look at with faces for radio. I didnt want a lap dance from any of them. Deja was dark, dank and sad. My bf and I went there planning on lap dances and a wild time, and wound up paying the insane cover of $25 each, and left after about 45 minutes. I wouldnt recommend Deja to anyone. Try another LV club. There are def enough variety in LV.This place is horrible! I called to see if they carried an Olympus TG-130 in stock and the employee on the phone put me on hold for over 30 minutes like its BestBuy or something. I had to repeat TG to her about 4 times before I had to give her phonetic alphabet so she could know that T=Tango and G=Golf...No! I had to dumb it up for her, "T" for Tom and "G" for go! After another wait to see if she carried it in stock, finally they did carry it. I asked for pricing and they told me they could not give out prices over the phone! WT****...so I asked her "really? so you are telling me that I have to drive out from Henderson, over 25 miles to know the price?" she said "yeah." Un-freaking believable!!! I bet anything it's one of those places that does not tell you how much things are so when you visit them you find out an item that is $100 is $500 there! Anything to fish you to try to make you come out. Would not do any business with them. Very poor customer service!!!I can see why they closed for a while. probably will again soon. We tried to eat there. It was 6:10 pm, we didn't have a reservation. There was no line, nobody waiting and only two tables with people at them. Never the less we were told it would be minimum of an hour wait but probably longer. I understand that it is a slow paced dinner, but that is ridiculous. needless while we were deciding where to spend our dinner money not one other person went anywhere near the restaurant. I've eaten at the melting pot in other states, it wasn't ever that great to wait over an hour for, but at least they knew how to seat their customers. At least I won't feel the need to go back.There was a large group of us visiting Vegas for a bachelor party and the groom wanted pizza so we attempted to try Metro. We had to take multiple cabs to get out group there. We arrived 10 minutes before closing and the hostess (who was still manning the front door) notified us that they were closed. I pointed out that we were their before their posted closing time and that we were planning on giving them some substantial patronage. She started to seat us when a cook literally ran up to the front to put the kabosh on that. He said he was, "just following orders" and I asked to speak to the manager. He said something dirty under his breath and at that point I felt that it wasn't safe to order food from the kitchen and we left. Obviously can't comment on the food, but of their food is reflective of their service, don't go.The first time I went here I had called ahead and found out they closed at 10 I showed up at like 9:50 the hostess had a few friends hugged and chit chatted with them while my buddy and I stood there. A few minutes later she asks if I'm there to eat, I tell her I am, and then she says oh well we stopped seating at 9:45...Let alone the fact that no one was manning the hostess both so we stood there before she showed up and started reminiscing with friends for a few minutes before that. 

Worst economic recession in over 50 years and we've started closing early?

So we go the next week. Get some Filet with lobster sauced enchiladas, and I mean, the food was so salty that if my dad were to eat it he'd go into Heart Failure. Worse than that our appetizer had some little potato food thing the size of a quarter, and two shrimp. Not worth it! 


Our server was nice and the salsa for the chips and dip is pretty good, but for a mexicanesque restaurant you need better than good salsa and appetizers that fill an infant to get on my good graces. 

Also hostess staff and all staff have to realize that you don't close until customers stop coming.No stars would be more like it. Management is BAD BAD BAD !!
We will NEVER return. 
I don't care how good the food is, BAD PEOPLE !!Lady working there was rude and lacked knowledge of her products.This place is ok if you want to hit some golf balls and the sun just happens to be down already. Other than that, I'd steer clear of this place. Its technically on the strip so just like anything else else on Las Vegas Blvd, they mark everything up 30%. It would be ok if they had the quality to back it up, but they really don't. The people working inside both the shop and the bar are obnoxious and rude. The only good people here are the kats that move your bag the 10 feet from outside the course to the inside.

I've been here a few times now, but the last time was my last. While out with my parents and my wife (her first time), all the long tees were taped off, so you could only tee from the front tees. Thats fine, it happens. Since it was my wifes first time, I got a cart so she didn't have to worry about getting down each hole with clubs. But just before the 7th tee, the cart broke down. I pushed the cart til I finally saw a club cart just after the 9th tee. She hooked up the broke down cart and said she'd tow it back, never offering to even bring a new cart for the clubs and things we were carrying. When I got back to the clubhouse I told the guy behind the desk what happened, just looking to get a half refund or something comparable and he didn't believe me. I stood there while he took 10 minutes and called around to verify that our cart had actually broken down. After getting off the phone, he told me that my cart broke down on the last hole so we were basically done golfing. Even though I told him I pushed his broke ass cart from the 7th hole, he was adamant that the cart was picked up on the last hole. So he wrote his managers number on a card and told me to call him about it. 

Not even wanting to deal with it I took the number and met my parents and wife at the bar. It was Sunday so football was about to start. We just wanted to have a beer and talk about my wife's first experience. However the bartender was in no way ready to deal with people even though the bar had been open for an hour. Kegs needed to be changed, things needed to be turned on, and instead he was standing around watching TV. In the short time we were there, he must have used the 'F' word at least a dozen times. My mother, offended by his language, didn't want to stay. 

In the end, we paid way more than we should have for a sub-par experience. If you want some night golf, I would suggest Desert Willow. If you are looking for something during the day, I would suggest ANY OTHER GOLF COURSE IN TOWN.
Don't waste your time or money at this place.Stay away from this cheesy service,  when you ask for "basic wash" they will not verify which wash you want but stick you with their premium Interior and Exterior wash.  None of their labeled washes use "Basic" so the attendant should have verify which wash  and not stick you automatically with their "Value Meal".  Their manager wouldn't agree and said Basic Wash means "Interior and Exterior".  His IQ is probably close to 0.honestly, this place sucked.  here's why.  I've NEVER left an italian restaurant hungry until I went to casa di amore.  The seating was ridiculous.  my wife and I were sitting so close to other guests, that we could've eaten off of their plates.  I had hopes in the "homemade" noodles only to be let down.  Couldn't tell the difference between that and store bought.  Not to mention, I ordered chicken alfredo, right?  I could have literally held the amount that they served me in the palm of my hand.  I had like 5 or 6 cubes of chicken in my pasta. It was pathetic and didn't taste any better than the $1 crap I could've bought in the wal-mart frozen food section.  I paid over $20 for a $2 dish.  The italian ristorante to the west or the sicilian ristorante to the east beats this place by leaps and bounds, no question, and they don't treat you like cattle.  Let this be a lesson to you casa di amore, stop screwing your customers.Why does delivery take so long. I dont get it. My sandwich wad freezing cold when i got it, and if i wasnt starving i wouldve never eaten it. Plus the delivery driver was so unfriendly.Maybe I came on the wrong day because my barber's name was Richard and I was very unhappy. I could have probably gotten a better fade if I had done it myself. The top of my hair was uneven because Richard didn't take the time to run the clippers over it enough times to get all of the hairs. I ended up having to go home and fix it.long story short, the place is the worst experience i have had in years.  the blooming onion greasy the salad sparse one waiter must have taken a bath in his cologne,  and finally  the steak cooked medium rare was tough as shoe leather

i will never go back to that poor excuse of a restaurantComplete lack of respect for peoples time. Dirty office and a staff that has even less respect for their patients! Don't waste your time waiting here you'll spend less time waiting and get better care in an er!. I have been waiting 1hr and 30 mins past my 2nd appointment. Dr didn't even know why I was there!Be wary of the sizing.  I brought my granddaughter in to get a pair of shoes.  She is 3 years old and is currently wearing a size 7.  The store clerk measured her foot and said she should be wearing an 8.5W.   I questioned the difference in size, but she was  positive she measured correctly.   They didn't have her size in stock so I went home and ordered online.   We just got the shoes three days before her 4th birthday and lo and behold the shoes were at least an inch too long.   Do you know what it is like to disappoint a little 4 year old who had her heart set on the cinderella shoes.   I would like to smack that store clerk up the side of the head.  I think they should train their salespeople a lot better.    Really disappointed in the store -- the Las Vegas outlet.The Worst Reuben I've had anywhere. 

Corned beef was like hard strips of rubber, no sauerkraut, and a small sandwich to assault to injury. 

Great service though and low pricesI agree with some of the reviews on this PJ's. At least now I know I am not the only one who experienced a rude manager and sub standard service. Pizza was late and they seemed to think it was okay to be late. It was an office function!!!!  No accountability at all. When I called to check on it they were like....it's on the way offering no apology! If other places like Mexican restaurants, sandwich delis can deliver on time - why can't a pizza place do it. At the end of the day they just don't have high standard and think nothing of being late!After a long day of moving boxes out of my house into a storage I was exhausted by the time I arrived to Home Depot. I needed a u-haul truck to transport the remainder of items out my house which btw I needed to have out the house that day. I go to customer service and speak with one lady about renting a truck overnight. First she said that she didn't think they did overnight renting and it was almost closing time so I wouldn't be able to get one that day for the use of same day. She was uncertain whether they did overnight because of some recent things that had occurred. She spoke with the Assistant manager over the phone who told her that she could go ahead and rent me an overnight vehicle. I went back to my car to let my boyfriend know what was going on. As I returned into the store the lady I had been dealing with sent me over to another cashier to take care of this. This new lady has no clue about what I needed assistance with and has to ask the lady who sent me to her. While they are talking things over they then start doubting whether it will be okay to rent me the van and the new lady calls someone ( the assistant manager ) who comes to front right away and now says they will not be renting me the vehicle for overnight due to a recent situation that happen with one of the vehicles. I got really pissed off because the assistant manager switched up his decision and I had waisted valuable time there walking away without a truck. It basically was up to the assistant manager to decide if he wanted to allow a truck being rented for overnight. When the first cashier called him he should not have told her it was okay to rent me the truck for overnight. That particular location will never get my business again. They were all a bunch of.... Never mind i'll be nice. Located off serene and eastern.Thought I would give them another try. Still a lack of training for the kids that take the orders up front. This one was told by manager after my order was placed that he messed up my order. Instead of the manager adjusting the order once the mistake was caught, the over-charge of my meal left me ticked. Will NOT be back. Massive #fail on many levels!All the reviews here are correct.  The guys here are a-holes.  Also, they do NOT sell  parts and supplies as their business lists here.  Stay away.Do you know how this facility has so many 5 star reviews? 

They have a raffle every couple of months for those parents that leave "5 STAR" reviews for this facility and the winner gets a free week of tuition!! Very sad indeed!

I have to say that two teachers in this facility are good with children, but the rest especially Dana & Becky treat your kids very harsh, especially if you are not around. I was standing behind the wall once and heard Dana yelling very loudly at this poor 2 year old child. 5 Minutes later when his dad was picking up the same child, he was been treated like a Prince and that is definitely wrong!!

There is little teacher-student interaction at this facility. At times, I felt that the teachers were burnt out and were looking forward to Friday on a Monday morning. One of the teachers explicitly told me at 10:30 am on Monday that she can't wait for Friday and she is tired of hearing kids wining. ( I understand that we all have bad days, but at least keep such comments to yourself). 

My child is no longer attending this school and I encourage you not to be deceived by  the fake smiles that most the staff at La Petite Academy give you. There are at least 3 better daycares in the near vicinity. As a parent, please do your homework before enrolling your children in a daycare.Live right across the st and I've been in a few times.  Two of the guys that work there are a zero on the friendly scale.  Prices seem a little higher also.  Not a fan of this particular store, but on the plus side, easy in easy out.SERVICE IS SO BAD!  This is NOT a true 'all you can eat' sushi bar.  I ordered sushi and 2 hours later they came out with rolls.  I didn't order rolls, I enjoy sushi.  They said I have to wait all over again if I want my sushi.  What a ripoff..

Then I came on here to write a review, and noticed this has happened to a lot of people!  How pathetic of a restaurant, to push out old food or filling food, to save the quality sushi and save money.  $27 + a guaranteed 18% gratuity tip...NO THANKS!I'm in utter disbelief of how bad this place was. With all of the amazing reviews I thought there was no way it could be bad. How on earth do they get such great reviews in AZ? There's so much better Mexican food here, even right down the street from Barrio. I will say the guacamole is great-super fresh but super awkward when your Henry Rollins look alike server is angrily smashing it together next to your table. Apparently he doesn't like that part of his job. Actually, it seemed like he pretty much hated his job, which may have ruined a lot of my experience. We ordered our guac & he asked if we wanted anything besides water-we told him we hadn't looked at the drink menu yet and he slams it back on the table and says "Guess I'll leave this here then"....sorry, Henry. I'm also the kind of person that says "thank you" throughout my meal...like when you fill my glass, bring my food, take my plate etc. Not once did he say "you're welcome". Such a douche. I did read in one other review that the servers treat you like you should be so lucky to be eating there. Definitely felt it. Anyway, got the Conchinita Pibil Tacos. Pork was dry and tortillas were soggy. You get 4 street tacos on corn tortillas and for some reason someone thinks its a good idea to dump salsa on them so they fall apart by the time they get to your table. Pair that with a side of Ore Ida steak fries and you have yourself a $13 dinner? Thank god I didn't spring for a pricier dish since I thought after the guacamole I'd be mostly full anyway. My boyfriend got the seafood Chile Relleno and said it was ok - for 21 bucks it should have been way better than ok - I don't eat seafood much so I didn't try it but I've seen him get more excited over a shrimp burrito from Señor Taco. To end the evening our server took 10 minutes to pick up our payment from our table, and blatantly ignored my boyfriend trying to get his attention. I took my leftovers in a to go box to be polite when the busser asked if I wanted them since I still had half a plate of food, but did not hesitate to throw them directly into the trash when I got home. I don't even normally write reviews, but I was so blown away by the vast difference between the reviews I'd read and my experience that I just had to. The only reason I'd ever return to this place would be for happy hour. Drinks and guacamole, yes. Dinner - never again.I have never heard of Via Delosantos but my sister told me the food was amazing and she was shocked I have never heard of this place. While I was waiting to be seated I pulled up Yelp on my phone and started reading reviews. Arik B's review was funny as hell but also scared the shit out of me. The chips and salsa were good but not great. The rice and beans were blah. The vegetarian chalupa had a lot of guacamole on it topped off with lettuce and cheese. I can't believe they even serve this on the menu it's horrible. My cheese enchilada topped of with their white queso sauce was really good so if I ever get dragged to this place again I will order that. During dinner my sister mentioned that she has seen roaches in the restaurant while she was eating and In my head I was thinking " Dammit Arik B was right"!This sushi restaurant is ridiculously expensive and unacceptable.  I had a restaurant..com coupon that was for $15.00 off  $22.50.  When we placed our order we were told the coupon was not good for happy hour.  I did not read that anywhere on the coupon. So we decided to order ale cart.  First of all there is a lot of food that had  no prices on the menu ex. appetizers, salads, soups,  and green tea.  Secondly, I ordered shrimp tempura which never arrived to my table.  When questioning the waitress, she said the other waiter forgot.  She showed me a receipt for $39.51 minus my $15.00 from my coupon. All that we had to eat was some salads, soup and some tofu.  The only thing they did bring out that was satisfactory was citrus salmon for my daughter.  For $23.00 and a small tip, we left feeling starved.  As I arrived home my stomach started to bother me.    I would not suggest this place for sushi to anyone.  I also noticed that the whole place was empty.  I wish I would have read yelp before wasting a $15.00 coupon on this scam of a place place.I have to say, I am amazed at the good reviews this place gets.  But, then again, I know that the average Las Vegas visitor is all about the glitz and, well - taste isn't exactly the strongest of traits . . .usually.  I'll have to keep telling myself this because it is the only way to explain some of these reviews.

We popped in on Tuesday evening, May 8th, 2012 . . . the menu looked interesting, and since my Vietnamese partner had not really enjoyed the food offerings of Las Vegas to this point, we decided to give this supposedly fine Chinese restaurant a go . . .  I guess it should have been a hint when there was no wait and no need for reservations.  And, that's even with it having an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains right outside its windows.

(I went to their website to find the exact dishes on their menu, but they only seem to have the brunch menu and a special mother's day one - so, sorry).

We started with some appetizers - the spring rolls (which were bland, nothing special and weren't a far reach from frozen ones) and, we ordered a side-order of the Chinese broccoli - which was cooked fine, but again, nothing special - just plain, steamed with no seasonings at all.  Meh.

My partner ordered the tofu dish - (which is in one of the photos posted on Yelp.com) . . . . small square cubes of tofu in a sauce which was supposed to be spicy . . . it was not.  When my partner pushes a dish away and is quiet, I know it is below par (it doesn't happen often).  I am not a tofu fan, but I tasted the sauce, or at least attempted to taste it - because, frankly, it had almost zero flavor.  I've never tasted a more bland sauce.

Another member of our party and I ordered a whole fish dish that was fried (sorry I can't remember the name of the dish, but I believe it was the only fried fish dish on the menu).  The fish was fried nicely, a rather pedestrian batter, but nicely done - a tad overcooked, but at least fresh.  But, the sauce.  The "fresh" tomato sauce.  Seriously, it tasted like dollar-store ketchup with a little white vinegar and maybe a splash of Hoisin sauce.  It was definitely not made fresh - and was so ketchupy that it was really horrible.  

I want to say, I cannot remember in my years of eating in all sorts of restaurants and cafes all over - I cannot remember EVER complaining about a meal.  And, again this time, I sucked it up and ate my fish, trying to avoid the sauce - but, I really couldn't stand seeing my partner not eating anything after only a couple of bites.  The waiter was obviously not pleased, but he did allow him to reorder - pushing hard for the chow mien, which he ordered.  This dish was so salty that it was inedible.  (I had to later take him to an all night diner just so he didn't have to go to bed hungry).

The waiter was not happy at the prospects of THIS dish also not being acceptable.  He said he would talk to his manager - and came back and said that his manager said that everyone could have dessert (pre-selected, not our choice) - on the house.  We didn't want dessert and politely asked that my partner's meal be taken off the check.  Instead of responding - he kept trying to place the dessert in front of my partner.  When we said no, he finally came back and said the manager had taken it off the check.

Now, about the manager - I don't know if it was Mr. Roberto Liendo as listed on their website or if it was someone else.  What I do know is that he is a total coward.  Have the courtesy to come to the table and talk to us about the meal - especially since everything was so sub-par (we did tell the waiter about the fish, but did not ask for it to be removed from the check).  Considering the prices of this food - anyone would expect that the food be extraordinary - or at least above par.  This wasn't even as good as most take-out Chinese restaurants.  

Oh, the place is beautiful - but, that's the only value to this place based on our visit.  A horrible experience and I would highly suggest that if you are reading this review while trying to decide where to eat - pass this one up - you can go outside to see the fountains.As big fans of Bobby Flay and his recipes from the Food Network, we were anxious to try this out on our trip to Las Vegas last spring.  We could only afford to do a couple of the celebrity chef restaurants, and scheduled this for a nice lunch on our last day in Vegas.

I am sad to say that the food did not live up to the prices or the hype.  i had a chicken and avocado quesadilla that was overcooked and something I could have easily made myself at home.  My wife had the yucatan chicken tacos, which were three TINY tacos and again nothing special.   We each drank non-alcoholic drinks and the bill came to over $40 for sub-par food.  (As a side note, we love a good meal and are not afraid to spend a lot of money for truly quality food, but this was not hte case.)

A couple of positive points to note:  the atmosphere and space is quite nice and a quiet respite inside the Caesar's casino.  I also suspect their cocktails are quite tasty, as is their signature appetizer the Queso Fundido.  However, our experience was quite poor.

It's likely a better visit if Mr. Flay is in the kitchen when you happen to be there, but on a whole, I would leave this one off of your list of places to visit.  Vegas is full of some of the country's BEST restaurants in terms of food and service.  Spend your money elsewhere.I have been three times since moving to AZ, and the last two were ot by choice.  I have yet to leave without an awful headache from the ridiculously loud music.  It is cramped and the food is no better than what you'd order in a drive thru.  The prices are outrageous and the staff is less than 'happy'.  I don't know what AZ88 the other posters have been to yielding these great reviews, but if an awful headache and overpriced drive thru food served from unhappy cramped environments interests you, then this is your place.  I will never go again, even if forced.  Turn down the music and I may consider it...avoid!This place sucks really bad where to star first off I found they were not to nice to black people I make a fair share of money and was told to leave the casino still don't know why they said they caught me cheating really I was just sitting there watching my 70yr old mom play the penny slots then they said I was not cheating I was to drunk to be in there but last time I checked you can't get drunk off water then they just came out and said we don't want your kind here whatever that means so please watch out if you go there they may not want your kind thereHousekeeping stole $50 from my girlfriends wallet and did not take responsibility for their employees. They pretty much said, you cant prove it so tough luck. I will never stay there again.  Be aware!I didn't even get to stay at this hotel, thanks to their deceptive business practices and the idiots they employ at customer service. A day after booking a package that included two free show tickets, I called--confused by a website they linked to in an email I received--and was informed that every day of my package was a "blackout date," which is why I couldn't book any tickets. Huh? I picked the dates on the calendar popup ON THEIR WEBSITE where it said "check availability" and paid for a "winter entertainment package," then got a confirmation email saying to go pick out my show tickets.  After over an hour on the phone with probably six different people basically explaining how outrageous the whole situation was, they finally found tickets for me somehow and confirmed me for a date and time with seat numbers. I received a confirmation number and thought everything was fine. But then the next day they called me and said sorry, those ticket didn't exist, the confirmation number didn't confirm anything, and sorry that we wasted over an hour of your time yesterday but there's nothing we can do for you. Give me a fucking break. Cancelled my reservation, and now don't plan on seeing any show associated with them. I'd recommend you do the same.Just checked in and the jerks downgraded my suite!  While the counter clerk was nice, the manager was arrogant and only offered food vouchers.  You just insulted me and checked my room out - what makes you think I want your food?!  Worse no refunds...I am sure I will still have a great time, but based on this experience and what I have heard do not stay at TI or Treasure Island under any circumstances!!!Will NEVER EVER stay here or recommend anyone to stay here!Horrible Horrible Horrible! We paid almost $200 a night, and when we got to our rooms our bed (white sheets n blanket)had big yellow stains n the pillow had yellow n red stains(like blood) on them.We asked to be switched rooms and they did although the front desk person was RUDE!They gave us a room on a whole nother end of the hotel seemd like I was walking from vegas to LA only to get there to the same thing.The beds were disguisting and im glad the sheets were white n not dark if not who knows what I would be laying on.We called FD again n the guy said if it was so bad n such a bad place to get our money n go find a better hotel.RUDE!When we asked to speak to a manager he ended up sending the cleaning lady to switch the sheets ,she had to pull 4 different sheets because all the ones she was pulling were the same.She was so emberresed she kept on appoligizing.I would have LOVED to see the manager getting his ass up there and change it himself after that horrible service they gave us.And NO they did not comp our room !It seems like they don't clean their rooms.  A friend of mine stayed here and saw the conditions of their room, I'm like... can we pre-game in mine? lol!

Get a remodel like T.I. did!  

The only reason why you even get a star is because I have to... and you have Hash House A go Go.You get what you pay for... and in this case, I wish I paid more somewhere else! I ended up staying one night here because I didn't want to be duped by Memorial Day Weekend prices.

The rooms look like a motel and are outdated. In all honesty, if you just need a place to sleep and wash up (and not spend time in the room admiring the amenities), this would be an "okay" option.

The worst thing are the rooms by the pool (which I had) because for some reason, there is a damn pool party all day, everyday. So, if you are trying to take a mid-day nap to sober up or rest up for a night of fun... THINK AGAIN. You are going to be up and annoyed at the party people at the pool, the children at the pool, or the DJ who plays bad music. I swear the pool party noise starts at 11 AM and doesn't end until 6 PM! SO. ANNOYING.

Thank goodness I moved to Caesars Palace the next day. As someone told me, I went from a brokedown (Imperial) palace to the "better" (Caesars) palace!So disappointed in Mon Ami Gabi. 

Based on the excellent reviews I was very excited to try Mon Ami. We made reservations to eat here on our last night in Vegas and were also celebrating my mother's birthday. I am not sure if MAG was just having an off-night but our experience was all around pretty terrible. The dinner started with a very chaotic and unorganized seating systems. Despite having reservations you have to stand and wait in a line to speak to the hostess. Then they have you stand aside in the crowded bar area and wait some more. Meanwhile, they call names but do it so quietly and from a different area that it is impossible to hear. All of this made for a stressful start to our dinner. Once seated we ordered drinks which were mediocre in preparation and mine came with a very long dark hair curled around in it and hanging out the side of my martini glass. Very disgusting and off-putting way to start the meal. We let the server know and he was not really apologetic at all and then brought back a new martini that was not prepared the way I had ordered. The waiter was incredibly inexperienced and told the table next to us that thier bottle of wine would cost "whatever 12 times 4 is". He then proceeded to break the cork into thier bottle of wine. We ordered appetizers that came out freakishly fast- within two or three minutes of ordering them. I had the house salad which was very small and had wilted brown lettuce in it. My mother had shrimp cocktail which was mushy and my father had french onion soup which was watery, had little or no onions in it, and had very little taste (my work cafeteria makes french onion soup that is WAY better). At this point with the combination of hair in our poorly made drinks, very disappointing food and terrible service, we decided to cut out losses and cancel our entree orders. 

One star for the manager (I think his name was Constantine) who was very nice and apologetic and did not charge us for anything. 

As a side note- we crossed the street and wandered into Caesar's looking for somewhere else to eat and got right into the Palm Restaurant (in the Forum Shops) with no reservations and had an excellent meal of lobster tail and steak!this place is horrible. Terrible food and their service is even worse.My girl made the mistake of booking a room here a few weeks ago cuz her friend was getting married here.  It's terrible here.  Don't stay at this shitty hotel because:

1. The stupidass elevator that goes up diagonally shakes, a lot. 
2. Taco trucks have provided me better customer service.
3. At some point in your stay, you'll have to decide if you want to claim blood, cuzz, or la eme. 
4. The rooms are dark, depressing, and dingy.  
5. For just a few extra bucks you can stay somewhere nicer. 


After we checked into our disappointing room, we immediately advised front desk we were going to check out right away because of the poor condition it was in.  Front desk advised they would waive the room fee for the night if we checked out.  We did so, yet they still charged our credit card.  

We ended up staying at the MGM for just a little bit more.We got a deal for $45 per night during a conference so we stayed here. There was also a $15 per night resort fee which said it covered in-room internet, the gym, etc. When it said in-room internet I just assumed it meant wireless. It doesn't. You pay $15 per night for wired internet (if you brought a cable and if you can find the plug...we couldn't). 

There is no wifi available at all in the rooms. None. So, the first day I camped in Starbucks all day and paid $9.99 for slow wifi. On the second day I discovered that if you sit in the Bazaar area, you can connect to the MGM or Mirage free wifi and get better signal that you can get from the service you have to pay for elsewhere in the hotel. The chairs are also more comfortable and the ladies that work at the snack shop there are really nice.

Our room was in one of the towers and it looked like it hadn't been upgraded in ages. The door handles were all scuffed and scratched. For some reason you don't get a real comforter either. Just a sheet, a thin blanket and a "satin" cover. Saving on laundering costs I suppose?

The walls are also very thin. We could hear everything going on in the rooms next door. Even just the flush of a toilet can be heard.

The elevators are literally falling apart. Many buttons are missing and the control panel is exposed in many of them. I felt oh so safe.

The housekeeping staff doesn't follow the "towels on the floor need to be replaced, those hanging don't" rule. I try to conserve water in hotels by not asking for new towels every day. I don't get them at home, why would I in  hotel? But they replaced them every day anyway. Not very "green."

My final, and biggest, complaint is that the room keys are terrible. In 3 days I had to get 4 new keys because they stop working if you get them anywhere near a credit/debit card or a cell phone. I'm a girl, I keep everything in a purse. How am I supposed to keep the key away from everything in my purse? I tried by surrounding the room key with business cards but that didn't work.

One night at 3 AM, I returned to my room and my key didn't work. I went to the front desk to get it fixed (again) and they said their system was down so they couldn't give me a new key. They told me to wait by the elevators for someone from housekeeping to let me in my room. I waited by the elevators and no one showed up. So I went back to the front desk and finally got a new key. When I got up to my room, the phone rang and it was housekeeping telling me that someone from the front desk was "looking for me" and then put me on hold. I hung up after waiting 30 seconds.

I will never stay at this hotel again. I guess you really do get what you pay for.Where do I begin.  How about the 90 minute line while I waited with 60-70 others to check in.  Only 3 people open at the front desk, which had stations for 15 employees.   Or the elevators - in the whole week, only 3 of the 8 elevators were in operation.  None were broken, the hotel is just cheap.  10-15 or more minutes to get an elevators most of the time.  Or the pool - which isn't actually a pool one could relax in - it was over 104 degrees every single day yet NO SHADE.  you could "rent" an umbrella - for $300 PER DAY.  I am not making this up.  The Cabanas were for rent also, $675-$995 PER DAY, depending on if it was the weekend.  But $300 per day for the shade umbrella???  Please!!!!!

Absolutely no chairs or benches anywhere on the property, inside or out; no place whatsoever to just sit and relax and read or anything.  Enormous empty sprawling space insdie and out - with nothing.  Apparently they want to force you to stay in Casino or one of the several horrifically expensive restaurants.  

No prices on ANYTHING.  This includes the couple of "gift shops" selling toiletries, soda, water, candy, cards, magazines, all the usual stuff.  Not a price on a single thing, not even a pack of gum.  You had to ASK price of every single thing.  Of course, when a $2.99 bottle of water costs $5.50, it's  small wonder.

Which brings us to the Mini Bar.  It was MAGNETIZED, so that if you even moved something aside, you'd be charged.  So could not use the refrigerator at all.  

Location is AWFUL as well. It's not only at the end of the "strip" - the next place is more than a mile away.  You are stuck in the middle of nowhere with absolutely nothing to do, no place to sit, unless you pay the $300 daily fee for the pool since  shade is pretty important when it's 105+ degrees.

Signage is unbelivably bad.  Almost impossible to find your way around.

No information offered on things like the light rail/monorail which we could have taken into 'town' had we known about it.  

I could go on.  And on and on.  You have been warned.  STAY AWAY FROM MANDALAY BAYVery unfriendly and regimented staff...no flexibility!  Carpet in room is dirty (the bottoms of my feet are black!)  No coffee in room, sofa setting awkward, not enough towels, heavy doors that slam easily.The "security guards" are seriously the biggest dicks ever.... The parking is horrendous and they actually TOW THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES OUT OF THE DESIGNATED EMPLOYEE PARKING.  Go to south outlets... At least you know your car will be safe.  Security calls the tow truck drivers to tow their own people... What the hell?  They are rude and no offense, but if there really was a serious situation that would happen at the outlets,  they would be the first to Segway outta there and leave you stranded and helpless.I would give this club a zero if i could. This place is filled with douche bags. 

When my friend tried to get in with her OWN id card the bouncer wouldn't let her in saying that it wasn't her. So we tried to reason with the guy, asking if we could bring some of her credit cards or other ids to prove that it was indeed her however he straight up said "you're not getting in."  So we then tried to talk to the club manager and it turns out that he was one  useless person. When we told him the situation, all the manager could say was that "I'm not trained to do this, he (bouncer) is."  At this point we were all frustrated and one of my other friends tried to talk to the bouncer again. He (the bouncer) probably figured by now that this was really her id (who in their right mind would try talking to the club manager with another person's id) and arrogantly told us that " he would look at her other cards or ids because we were complaining too much, but he would not guarantee that she will be able to get in."  After that we just wanted to know this so-called "well trained" bouncer's name and he wouldn't even give it to us.

 All in all i regret ever attempting to get into the PURE nightclub. After reflecting the night I realized that it was a complete waste of time trying to get into the club seeing that there weren't any people going to that club anyways. ( a sign of a dying nightclub if not, a dead club)I can't believe this place got good reviews. I was served a cold, stale pretzel. The bartender had his back to the bar almost the entire time I was there(over an hour). I didn't even bother getting an entree like I planned. I managed only 1 beer and a stale pretzel for the 1.5 hours I was there because the bartender was non-existent. Pathetic.Mediocre food. The best thing was probably the mashed potatoes. Chicken was dry and rubbery. Fish had a funny smell. Meat was average. Most things were too salty. Dessert was pretty good compared to the main food. Staff was average. Make the trip across the street to PH or Paris.Are you kidding? Why would you pay for the food they serve here? Do not waste your money or even your comps for this resto. Rated this 1 star since Yelp would not let you rate 0 stars. Use your comps or pay for the buffet at another mgm property. The best item I had was a glass of milk.This is by far one of the worst customer service I've encountered. The food is not too bad, but not good either. The service on the other hand is poor, if I have the option of 0 star I'd. 
We went last Saturday and waited forever for a table to open up when there were plenty that were available. While we wait one of friend needed water and she looked extremely pale so we asked if we can just get some water or may be just a bottle, which was right at the counter. To our dismay, the lady said "Oh no this is for employees only". Really? This big hotel has water designate to "employee only"? So we waited and my friend passed out from dehydration and almost had to go to the hospital over a $1 Water bottle. 
It is a shame that they don't value customer. They'll only care when you either passed out or about to go to the hospital.Really wanted to run out screaming several times.  I thought it was just me, but my husband and the couple we were with also thought is was like someones acid trip.  Really, no story line, nothing bringing the acts together, just randomness and really weird costumes.  Thankfully, our tickets were only $50 plus fees came to $65 each.
I will say, there were several great acts, such as the two brothers doing the strength/balancing.  AMAZING!!! Truly.  The music was phenomenal, including the special sound effects.  Still, that was background for a lot of very strange things.  A grown man pretending to be a baby and talking baby talk?  Ick.  Hairy legs and all.  I don't want to take away from the performers, since they did their jobs very well, but the presentation is horrible, unless you just smoked some crack.This review will help those who are considering getting a table.

I made reservations for a table with the club days ahead. 
Getting a table has its advantages. Don't have to wait in line and you have a place to sit an lounge plus room to dance.
The table they sat us at was upstairs. 
I would not recommend one of these tables. You are totally cut off from the crowd and the dance floor. 
After about an hour we noticed the table next to the girl flower tub and dance floor was available. We had them relocate us to this table. 
Which was quickly and easily done.
The location was great.

Ok now for the reasons I gave this club a one star.
The pricing of the bottles was grossly overpriced. $650.00 for a $50.00 bottle. Thats really ridiculous.
One of the biggest problems I have is the girl that was hosting our table.
She was talking to me with a stripper personality. She was asking me where I was from. Once I said LA she continued to ask me if I wanted to get together next time she is in LA. I was there with my girl friend. The hostess didn't care and kept talking to me to get my contact info.
I felt this was totally unprofessional.
When I payed the final bill, she was persistent that she get my contact. I still rejected her.
They automatically put gratuity on the bill. I Ok'ed it and then gave her additional 100 dollar bill. She then said to me that she has to share the tip with the fellow that was helping clear our table. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. 
I asked her; "I am sorry, what was that?" 
She said again that she has to split the tip. I was in shock.
I just turned away. 
Very unprofessional.
After that I knew that these employees are trained to treat their customers and squeeze as much as you can out of them. This girl was hitting on me only to try and get more.
After the night was over I had spent $4000.00 on the tables.
We left at 3am and some of our friends wanted to stay. 
After we paid our bill and left, the staff was very rude to my friends and before the club closed I found out the next morning that my friends were kicked out of the club for reasons that are not acceptable. They were only dancing in the seated area and talking to girls and gave my friends problems. One of my friends was actually pulled to a secluded back room. Once they found out that he is a police officer, all my friends were ejected from the club.
I think they had some other kind of plans for him by bringing him back to that room.

Another situation that happened during our time was that this party was all for a friends 21st birthday party. My friends parents had joined us. Now my friends parents are a little older, but they have every right to be there.
His mother was talking to the girls in the tub and one of the girls said to her.
"Why are you here lady, you're too old to be here"
Shocking!
My friends mother pretty much told her off and the girl in the tub struck her with her fist.
Security came over and pulled the girls from the tub. 

I agree with all the other reviews.
The club was over crowded.
The club was very hot in temperature.
The line outside was very long.
Yes, being a guy. I had to wait in line to use the bathroom. 

Would I recommend this club? Absolutely not!
I would recommend going to Tryst or XS.

I think the biggest problem with this club is the management.
Training their staff to try and squeeze as much as they can from their patrons.Gave me a handicap room when I didn't order one. Said they don't gurantee me a room unless I pay a fee. Ridiculous and stupid!!!!!!!!:-(This is the first time I have been motivated by an experience to write a review. Pretty good food, overpriced for the quality and quantity. Service was the worst I have ever had. Group of 8. In an empty restaurant (should have been a clue) treated like an annoyance once we declined the waiter's suggestion $200 bottle of wine. Waiter made subtle comments about us splitting salads, and how normally people order full salads with dinner which is why our dinner was so delayed.  Once our waiter realized that we weren't going to have a $1,000 bill, it was the last we saw of him.  Just a few visits from the assistant waiter to refill water.  

Upon leaving we were visited by our waiter one last time to get a small tray of sweets on the house since "none of you bothered to order dessert".  Very nice of him to say.  

Anyway it was by far the worst experience I have had in a restaurant in Vegas.  I am there frequently for business and have eaten at many restaurants on and off the strip.  This was by far the worst dining experience I have ever had.Ok... so this might end up being a long review, so let me get to the main points before I explain my reasoning.

Customer service is the WORST my wife and I have ever experienced.
Intentionally difficult and not accommodating.
Lied to us, and screwed us out of money!

Ok, so I will start out with our story.  My wife and I purchased a groupon several months ago to celebrate our honey moon.  We got married the day before we ended up checking in...  but our problems with them started WAY before check in.

Before we bought the groupon, we had checked with them to make sure our dates for our honeymoon were available.   We were stoked b/c a 4 start resort on a discount!!! plus it will be a place we can always come back to, to celebrate.  So we bought the groupon and literally the moment we had it in our had, we went to book the room for 6 days...  turns out... they were mistaken, they didn't have the rooms available for us.

after SEVERAL weeks going back and forth, even getting laughed at (when they thought they put us on hold, one representative said to another representative  "another one of the groupon people" then laughed) we had not reached an agreement.

I went to Groupon to get a refund... I explained what happened, and they said the would see what they could do.  Groupon called back and were able to get me 4 out of the 6 days I purchased, and would refund me the rest... Groupon by the way has REMARKABLE customer service.

So anyway, my wife and I get married and we go to check in.  I tell the front desk guy (Jake), "Hi, Brett V_______, checking in for our honeymoon"... he says... "name again".  I respond "Brett V____, checking in for our honeymoon"  he responds "ok".  I present the the groupon and he asks if I've read the terms of the groupon and there card policy" (they freeze $100 a day you are there).  I tell him yes.  He says, ok... then proceeds to check me and asks if we want an upgrade for certain prices.  I say, "no, we are trying to keep on our honeymoon budget."  He continues to check us in... and we get the keys to our 1st floor, view of the parking garage, room.

Not to mention our room came with a bluetooth pick floss thing that was left on the floor, and left there by housekeeping our whole stay, and under the table was some guy's boarding pass from MARCH!!!

Look, I'm not expecting a free upgrade b/c it's our honeymoon... but we got a CRAP room... and can I at least get a freaking "congratulations" or "thank you for choosing Green Valley for your honeymoon"...  I didn't get squat... or even common courtesy.


Not sure if it's b/c Groupon people are treated as 2nd class citizens, or they had a note in my file b/c I had to have Groupon step in and hold Green Valley to their own contractually agreed upon word.

The wifey had a massage, which she said was nice, and her masseuse, was awesome... but the spa staff just didn't give 2 craps about her.  The Groupon says it comes with $25 a day resort credit, which we banked for her massage.  The spa pool is nice b/c its away from the kids and partying/loud music.  I ordered a drink at the spa pool and it took about 45 minutes to get it.  A couple of hours later I witnessed  2 ladies saying they were refusing to pay for their food b/c it had been over an hour and they didn't want it anymore.

When we finally checked out, they told me they wouldn't be applying the $25 a day credit to my massage bill (thus the expensive massage I had banked it for) b/c it was a "pool credit".  I told them it never specified it was a pool credit... they said it did... I double checked my groupon... nope... they are lying... does not say pool credit... it says resort credit.  the Spa is a part of the resort.  When I asked to see where the $25 a day credit went then... they told me "it wasn't on the bill and to not worry about it".  Sorry Green Valley, you are underhanded, slimy, and crooked in your dealings.

The only positive thing I can truly say about the place,  the staff at the "Tides" restaurant were over the top nice (my wife pointed it out and wondered if they knew the rest of the resort's customer service sucks so much, that Tides makes up for it) and they have a GREAT view for fireworks if you park on the 215 garage.

ok, that's it.  If you've made it thus far with my griping... I urge you not to go there... We wont be returning.

Brett & LindsAfter much time spent researching the best spa to get a gift certificate for my mother in law we decided on your spa.  I called several times but nobody answered. Finally  someone answered and said they had been having issues with their phone service.  I understood and asked to purchase a gift certificate to be emailed for a gift.  I was advised I would have to fax my photo Iid, and front and back of my credit card. Then once approved they could not email the gift certificate.  Wasted hours researching, trying to call, then told  could not purchase on the phone and I was not near a fax. For such a big, high end hotel it is ridiculous to not be able to give money and business either on line or by phone.  When charging top dollar 140  plus for a fifty minute massage it's not fair you wasted so much of my time.Green Valley Ranch is going down fast. We use to enjoy concerts there but they turned the Ovation into a BINGO ROOM. Like we need more Bingo in Vegas .The cocktail waitresses are slow and drinks mediocre. The  elevators are very slow and break down a lot.  I use to prefer Green Valley for Buffet over Sunset and Fiesta but yesterday was a DOOZY!  I sit down for lunch with my Pita and Hummus. I turned my 2 pita breads over and they were both MOLDY! I told the manager and they said thank you. that's IT?? I was talking to my daughter how I think I lost my appetite looked down in my broccoli and found a HAIR. I called a different manager over and he compd my buffet and gave me my coupon back. Gee thanks for comping my buffet that I didn't eat and NO im not coming back to use my couponDelightful atmosphere that is full of color and wonderful design. Mariachis were playing tableside which made the atmosphere fun! You immediately think good food is ahead....

The food....not so great. The food was very bland. The chips did not seem homemade. The menu suggests wonderful flavors in their food, but there actually  wasn't any pizazz or flavor to anything we had. Don't pay extra to try any of the salsas....bleh.

The service was horrible. The waiter did not know the menu nor could he make recommendations as to what the best food was on the menu. I flat out asked him what was most popular and he pointed out a salad. He didn't understand us when we asked questions and he did get some of our order wrong. 

I am really shocked how packed it was considering the flavors weren't good. We had tacos, quesadillas, beans/rice and tried various salsas. If you like authentic Mexican Food native to Arizona, this isn't the place for you. 

The food was overpriced and the drinks seemed reasonably priced. I will not go back to this place.Food was 3 stars.  The service was 0 stars due to Evon, our server, asking me after the meal was over why I only tipped her $5 for a $57.38 bill.  I gave her an extra $2 in cash but felt that she really did not deserve anything.  She was short with us and did not smile once.  We had 2 adults and 3 kiddos in our party.  She made us feel unwelcome and very uncomfortable.  James, another server, on the other hand was very friendly and even gave us a tip on a great ice-cream place to try out.  I gave an extra $2 for him.  I WILL NEVER EAT HEAR AGAIN AND WILL TELL ALL MY FRIENDS TO NOT COME HERE.  You make ok pizza in a quaint old house and I like your venue.  Please retrain you staff to not ask customers why they tip the way they do.  It is called a voluntarily gratuity for a reasons and I do not feel like I have to justify my tips and be interrogated.  VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.  i AM VERY SURPRISE FOR A PLACE AS NICE AS THIS.  We visited on Friday, April 12 at 12:57 PM I paid with my American Express card no. 233098. Thanks for reading.This place is embarrassing! The service was terrible, the management was rude and unorganized. The food was not good and way over priced. The setting is so fake classy... I have no idea how it has managed to keep up in Kierland Commons! Take your time and money elsewhere.My wife and I  first started going to Moorea when they opened 6-7 years ago. Like so many I developed the cult following this pool had. My wife and I would go every month they were open the last Sunday through Wednesday of each month.
Billy, Jamell, Tyler and the group were the best. Dee would have the best massage anywhere on the strip pool side. Christina would take care of drinks and each year we would meet new friends and hang out with old friends. After the casino was built it took on a new look.The cabanas built up on top never seemed to work. Everyone wanted to be at the pool for the action.
The pool gets a lot of press for being topless. Yes it WAS topless and my wife would love to leave her top at home however that was not the main reason visitors would come. It was the experience created by the pool and staff.
In May the weather prevented us from coming to the pool. We geared up for September and made our way to the Mandalay Bay hotel. I had reservations booked for the whole summer. We checked in like always and headed for OUR pool.
When we got there we were met by folks we did not recognize. Seems they had ropes lined up for a line that did not exist. We were met by a "promoter" who told us they had taken over the pool and were making it better. I will save my opinion of these guys. They did not charge us to get in telling us we would be hooked once we got it.
We went in and there were a few people around the pool. Billy was still there and he let us know there was a new management company running the pool. Then we discovered you had to have a top. My wife had to go to the hotel to buy a top. We then had a drink and watched as our beloved Moorea crashed. 
We left after two hours with tears in our eyes. We were done. We have since switched to Bare with so many of our Morrea friends however it will never be the same.
As this summer comes to a close I only hope Mandalay figures out a way to hire the employees back next summer and returns to the greatness it was.
I hear most our gone now. I also hear the pool was a bust this summer. Maybe we have a chance however i am not holding my breath.
If management is reading this please take a second look.
we miss Moorea Beach Club.This buffet was awful.   We went here for a quick dinner and the first sign of how bad it was was the lack of people in line!   We finally pay via an atm machine and then we get to the front of the line and they make us wait more!   There again were NO people in line and plenty of open tables.   

The food was downright bad.   I enjoy food and i love good buffets but in a city of many buffets this was poop.   The only positive in the WHOLE place was desset.   The chocolate fountain was excellent and the things to dip in it were good.   Cotton Candy is also good.   But the other food was the reason for the terrible review.   Fried chicken that's not good, steak that is poorly done, a dirty presentation and bad chinese....so many negatives and not enough positives in this town of buffets.DONT EAT AT THIS BUFFET! It is the worst buffet known to man. The meat was chewy and tough, the pasta tasted like it was expired, and there was too much oil in everything. Along with the little selection and the 17% for parties over 8, I never been to such a bad dinner buffet. Definitely would not recommend and never coming back. The food was probably poisoned too because 7/8 people in our party had diarrhea. Terrible. Absolutely terrible.Very rude manager. It is shame for such a nice place to have a manager who does not have any idea about customer service.Fiamma is way overpriced even for Vegas. Bread was cold (I mean like from the refrigerator cold) and the olive oil for dipping was cheap/low quality (excusable if you're not paying $30 a plate.) I was worried from the start.  Pear and bleu cheese salad had no bleu cheese kick - we forgot we were eating a bleu cheese salad. The short rib raviolini is definitely previously frozen which is misleading because the menu indicates that pastas are fresh. We asked our waiter whether this was true and he simply smiled back without an answer. 

There are so many great places to eat in Vegas at similar price points (Bouchon, Olive at Bellagio, DOCG) that it makes little sense to go to Fiamma. It's all show and no go.We waited on the slow line about 1 pm after we saw the american deal. Maybe I missed the fine print but I'm thinking it was a bait and switch. After waiting so long to just get in we stayed and had the french onion soup... delicious. The pepper steak was ordered by me and my friend and it was cooked the perfect medium rare... Soft, juicy,pink and not a lot of blood. Spice wise we both thought it was bland. Peppercorns were shoved around it and that was it. It was way overpriced and the waitress was nice but I wish I had just left or went with a sandwich and got out if there.The service was slow (they weren't that busy and we still had to wait around 45 minutes for our food) and menu overpriced (but it's Vegas, I know). 

I got the Lemon Butter Shrimp and I absolutely HATED it.  My pasta was drowned in an unappetizing lemon sauce and the pasta was clumped together and not fresh looking/tasting at all.  Eventually I just ate the shrimp, after dipping it in marinara sauce. 

I had a couple of bites of my friends' dishes and the only thing half decent was the prime rib and the sauteed spinach.  Everything else was not as appetizing as we had hoped, not even close ! 

YUCK !!Been coming to Vegas for 40 years and the worst breakfast I can remember.  We ordered the omelette w spinach and cheddar and the "exotic fruit plate".   Granted this is during February when fruits in general are not the best but berries and melons are normally good.  The fruit was not ripe, the spinach was uncooked, the cheddar cheese not melted and the overall omelette cold.   We sent it back and got back a hot omelette and another bowl of berries but the cheese in the omelette was still un-melted cheese (grated and cheese) and the strawberries now old (tasted like a bowl of strawberries that has been in the fridge - all soggy from the frost).  The waitress was apologetic.   But come on guys Vegas is the food capital now and that is just unacceptable.  Note to chef: if fruit is not good don't serve and learn how to make a simple cheese omelette.    And while I'm on my rant, not having a kids menu in the main cafe of a large hotel that is "family friendly" is unacceptable.  And before I get any replies that no hotel in Vegas is kid friendly, Mandalay bay has the Wave Machine in the pool and the Aquarium exhibit and is known as one of the best family hotels.   (pools were all closed btw and we were not told  that until we were standing in the registration line with their hand out for the $20 resort fee).   Bad experience!This club was a total joke ...the so called event guys (cuz they are way too small to be called bouncers) were rude and unfriendly .  We were on the guest list but they didn't care and they even have some rule that two guys can't stand near a girl in line ..weak! ..terribly represented club ...get some friendlier staff and maybe that will attract a better crowd ...there are so many great clubs to choose from in Vegas so don't make the mistake of wasting your money here ..I might be jaded since I often get free access to a lot of things in LV so I don't have to justify the cost of shows/rides and I feel it gives me a more objective viewpoint on things.

So here we go:
This roller coaster sucks.  You are constantly being jolted back and forth, up and down.  If you didn't have back/neck pains before you will after it.  The ride is short, very short.  It's over before you even have a chance to get into it.  It certainly has the possibility of being a good ride since the location/Setting is awesome but it was just very poorly done.  They need to scrap it and start over. This coaster is a PASS.

The roller coaster in Circus Circus Adventuredome is much better, but then again you do have to go to Circus Circus, and I wouldn't recommend anyone do that.  That's unless you need one more thing to tip you off before committing suicide.I loved this place once upon a time. It was cleaner, bigger and friendlier than it's northern parent. Been coming here for years and in the past had rated it at 5 stars. 

The last few times though, it's dirtier. The staff appears to be immature high kids. The service is much worse with every trip having some kind of service failure. 

Tonight I came for my birthday. At an hour before closing half the tables are covered in chairs and the place reeks of bleach. The prices are raised, but that has to happen sometimes. When our food is served it's wrong. Replacement food takes about :20 to get to us, after many patrons that arrived after the concern was raised got served and a reminder. My burrito was torn, and my quesadilla looked like a cat with a seizure prepared it. The only reason I could eat them is because they were almost completely empty. 

So... in short I'm not going back. I understand raising prices, but not while simultaneously subtracting service and potion size. Bye panda, I'll miss who you were when I first met you.I have often driven by this place and have noticed one rarely sees cars in the parking lot.  I understand why after my first and last visit. The abrasive attitude of one of the owners is intolerable.  You had better agree with her way of thinking.  Disagree with her and one might make her happy by slitting one wrists and bleeding to death in front of her.  Whether that would be enough might be questionable.I have to give it one star, because Yelp will not let me give it no stars.

This was worse than chef boyardee.

They burnt Veal Parm., badly, and still served it to my aunt.I LEFT THE RESTAURANT STILL HUNGRY AND VERY DISAPPOINTED!!First,. they sat us in the back corner.we waited about 15 min until the first cart finally arrived.(and the place wasnt even busy) apparently if you sit in the far corner of the restaurant, the carts dont come your way. they pushed the carts around to everyone around us but then they wouldnt complete their rounds to our table and just back their carts out and leave. when we went to tell the manager carts werent coming our way, they just rolled their eyes and said 'what you want"wtf? bad service,and food was so not worth it.. definetly will not be coming back!Price: usd44.99 per person is too expensive for the kind of seafood (no seafood taste) and other food they served and I have never in my life taste a crab and clam that's tasteless!
Food Quality: only Dessert and Sashimi is of better quality and some of the food in the hot section has been left there for too long that it kinda dry up!
Surrounding: a very old fashion interior and lighting for the food is very dark 
Service: my server is very nice and attentive

Now I know why there isn't any line on a Saturday dinner!
Overall, it definitely worth only 1 to 1 1/2 stars!!!!I concede Hash House ONE star because my husband loves their bloody marias and they do a pretty good lime margarita. That's where the good portion of the evening ended for us.

We have been to three of their LV locations. Each time we've gone to the M location, the service has been spot-on, our food has come out at the same time and of course, the food is ginormous and good.

The Sahara location is the pits. We went on a Saturday night and they seemed to be understaffed so we waited about 30 minutes for a table in spite of the dining room being only about half full.

We waited about 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order. As we were waiting, we glanced around at what some of the other diners were enjoying. When the waitress came back with our drinks, I asked her a couple of (I thought) fairly simple questions about the menu. My husband also wanted to know what the people next to us ordered because it looked and smelled delicious.

The waitress walked over to the other table and asked them what it was. We were slightly more than a little embarrassed. The waitress didn't know the answers to the questions I asked, either.

Negative five points for menu knowledge.

Then, when our meals came out, my husband got his first. Being the gentleman he is, he waited for our son and me to get ours. And we waited. And we waited. After about 10 minutes, mine came out. We asked the server, very politely, if the kitchen knew anything about the proper firing of meals because we had never experienced this at another location. The server, while holding my plate in his hand the whole time, proceeds to argue with my husband and tell us that since the kitchen doesn't use any heat lamps, they brought out food whenever it was ready. 

Which is all fine except that just the week prior at the M location, I went to lunch with a group of 15 people and our meals all came out within a couple of minutes of each other.

But back to the Sahara location. The server continues to argue with us and finally just stops talking. Standing there. Glaring at us. After a few seconds of this I looked at him and asked, "May I please have my dinner plate or are you going to continue to hold it hostage?" At which point, he thumped it down on the table in front of me.

Did I mention that the restaurant manager walked by at least twice during this and didn't say a word? Did I also mention that our son STILL did not have his dinner?

And at this point, both my husband's food and my food are cold. Then comes my son's hamburger. 

All told, three meals over the course of about 20 minutes. Without a word from our waitress, drink refills or the manager stopping by.

I will concede that my husband's bloody marys are always good. My grilled cheese sandwich, though cold, was still tasty. And my son said his hamburger was okay but nothing special.

We would much rather take the extra 30-40 minutes out of our lives and go to the one inside M, where they actually appreciate their customers and have common sense when it comes to firing food in the kitchen.I had a sampler plate, beans and coleslaw.

I don't know if it was the pink chicken on the sampler plate or the mayo in the coleslaw but I was serverely sick the next day.

Don't think I'll be eating there again.If Toby Keith really loves this place, he would fire the current chefs and hire new ones.  

The service was very nice but the food............bleh!  One of the worst BBQ Baby Back Ribs I've had.  It was dry and not much taste.  The Jumbo Fried Shrimps were so heavily battered, it tasted more like donut shrimps.  

I've come to the conclusion that Harrah's gives away food vouchers because no one would actually come here to eat if they had to pay for it!  Well, certainly not me.I live a block away from this place. I walk by it all the time and it seems to be busy all the. Time. I ate there few times but I'm yet to find a good item on their menu. The food is terrible. It is a beautiful place in terms of design and the staff are always nice but if you want good food don't even bother .Been here a couple times, never by choice. 

I can't really knock the service too badly as they don't seem any better or worse than any other chain on a busy night, but the food is just not very good. It's also pretty expensive for what you get. I always leave feeling like I would have been better off going somewhere else and either paying less for the same kind of food, or paying the same for way better food. I avoid this restaurant at all costs.Had the occasion to stop in for lunch a few days before NYE.  Big mistake. First, my party of three walked up to the hostess stand where two young ladies were sitting around chatting while a bunch of dirty tables remained out in the front in an otherwise empty restaurant. We asked for a table and were quickly ushered to a booth. When I asked again for a table I was told that none were available because they were not cleaned off. I asked if maybe she could clean one off so that we could sit there. Begrudgingly she agreed to do. I ordered the chicken ceaser salad. It was pathetic. There was no dressing...none. The chicken was dry, yellow and disgusting.  The salad was turning. I asked for a manager. A manager never showed up. The waiter said she was busy in the back. No new salad, just a lot of attitude. Rather then spend the rest of the afternoon at Rao's or Ceasers Palace, we immediately left the hotel. This is the worst dining experience I've ever had. I will NEVER go back there. You shouldn't either.We came for breakfast. Well, the lady who seated us was very friendly and addorable. What can go wrong? Waited and waited and finally we got asked if we wanted something to drink. Ok, one coffe and one latte. Is it strong? Yes sir. No it wasn't. Served in a glass (huh?). Tasted like brown dishwater. My partner had regular coffee. Horrible. Waiter came after 15 minutes. Hardly spoke English. We left. Pricey menu. Shitty service. Nice ambienceVery bad,  waitress!

Bad service, long wait time.  Crazy prizes. Specials not on holidays or weekend is what she told us, But it was a Wednesday (no holiday)....Have not been here in years AND WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!!!, After reading the other reviews it seems as though nothing has changed.  I still remember the visit here vividly as it was the worst experience i have ever had at any restaurant in my entire life!
I remember how dirty the place felt with the tacky decor, should have been a sign to run. Second issue the host had attitude to seat us in a booth with two children said no children allowed in booth. Didn't wanna hassle finding another place though because kids were hungry.
We ordered walnut shrimp, Mongolian beef, salt n pepper pork chop and fried rice.
About thirty minutes later I ask a guy where our food was. He said what food!? So I say never mind we are leaving. The original lady who took our order saw we were trying to leave started shouting "why u leave no pay, food coming u need to wait" [sic] 5 min later they proceeded to bring out food, they brought out fried shrimp, soup and Chinese broccoli. I said we didn't order this. She argued yes you did. By now I'm so livid I didn't wanna make a scene so I asked my husband to deal with them before I explode. So I go to the car. 20 minutes later he is walking to the car with the food we didn't order and I guess our order then I see the lady chasing him and saying no tip for me not even one dollar!! OMG are you serious?????!!!!!! She had the audacity to literary follow him outside and say this in the parking lot! Of course no tip, not after the absolute worst service ever !! That I thought was the worst part. My husband gets in the car to tell me the check was $83 meaning they charged us for the food we did not order!!!!!!!!!!!! He said the host who takes the checks wouldn't budge and said how does he know its not our fault and we keeping the food anyways even though we said we didn't want it he said ok we still made food if u keep or throw away u still have to pay! Unbelievable!!! If you want to experience a nightmare go here! Not saying your experience will be as horrendous as mine , but just thought I'd share my dining out nightmare here as I can see I'm not alone In this. 
Yelp should have a "worst restaurant poll" guarantee this will come up! Shut harbor palace down!!!I went expecting to see a club full of 8s 9s and 10s (female and male) and instead found a club 3/4 full of average-looking Asians. I had no idea there were this many Chinese people in Arizona. It was also a sausage party. I was in and out in 10 minutes. avoid.This restaurant is close to my home so it is convenient. I've been coming here for years and service has been up and down but over the last few months the consistent direction has been down. We visited on a Thursday evening (about 5:30) and were seated promptly. Chips and salsa arrived quickly and were very tasty. Both the salsa and the bean dip were spicier than usual (I am a wimp with spicy foods-most people would probably say the spice level is average). After ten minutes passed with no server approaching, I began to worry. When the server arrived, after five minutes later, we ordered drinks and food. I mentioned that I was very thirsty as we had been eating (the now empty chips and salsa). At this point the server left but did not return with our drinks or any waters. We could see her in the restaurant but she would not make eye contact. The busser never refilled the chips and salsa-it was as if we were invisible. Finally, when she was serving the table next to us, I flagged our server down and asked if we could please get our drinks. She said that they were out of glasses! I asked if I could have a drink in a to-go cup or anything else as at this point I was very uncomfortable from the spicy salsa-she laughed and left. A full 30 minutes after we were seated she returned with our drinks! No apology for the wait, no mention of any issues. I asked her if the restaurant was having a problem this evening and she replied that they ran out of rice and cheese. How does a Mexican restaurant run out of rice and cheese??? And what does that have to do with clean cups? The food, when it finally arrived, was decent. Not spectacular but flavorful and well-prepared. Service at this restaurant has been sporadic over the years but after watching several other groups give up and leave their tables before their food arrived we wish we had done the same.  The real kicker came when we got our check with the sodas still on the bill! Sadly, we will not be returning.Even though I was a tourist in Scottsdale, this place built for tourists made this tourist want to run the other direction.  There were some interesting stores that sold nick nacks and then some high end art galleries in this shopping district. I don't think the area knows what exactly it wants to be.  I was really bored and wanted to leave as soon as possible.  My host had only been here twice since they had recently moved to the area but she even admitted this would be a place that she wouldn't mind missing the next time guests came to stay.What kind of customer facing company doesn't allow you to speak to a person to complain? Somehow they managed to lose our bag in Chicago when we didn't even change planes there. We didn't even know we had to stop in Chicago until we got on the flight thanks to a very disinterested ticketing agent. And they didn't even offer to pay the $25 fee that we had to pay to get it to our final destination in the first place. You have to send an email and forms for them to even review to credit anything. The only saving grace was an associate that got permission for my boyfriend to buy a jacket since we were in Boston with just a tee shirt. And we still have to send in the receipts and a form to get that back. Overall one of the worst experiences I've ever had.This place sucks! They always set there line up in the middle of the sidewalk and I kick down there little barricade things every time I'm drunk leaving Rula-Bula. The music sucks and so do the people, it's like a old town club that is misplaced. Don't go there unless you like having a bad time.OK, Deep fried Twinke.  This is why we went in.  I've never tried this but always wanted to.  We go into this place, walked around and was wondering where the damn twinkes were.  It was mixed into the super dirty Nathans hot dog area.  I mean dirty looking(I rather go the a ecoli dog person).  As we ordered the guy behind the counter must have been tired becuase he went right to the fridge and got a red bull.  He then tried to open the can with his mouth only cuase he had gloves on, since he couldn't open it, he then opened it with his hands and gloves.  Now infecting his gloves with any spit that might have got on the can.  He did down the can!  Anywho, I looked past that and ordered up the fried twinkie.  I of course shared it.  Twinkie itself  had way too much batter or something cuase thats all I tasted.  After a couple bites each, we threw the sucker away. So, two people, two small bites and both didn't like it.  And yes, I love fried food so it wasn't that.

The casino itself was also super dirty.  Dirty restrooms too.  There were no tables there and maybe 75 slots.Our flight was cancelled due to weather conditions, which is understandable, what I couldn't understand is the poor handling of the cancellation process. They refused to help us on the spot and asked us to call a number in order to get the full refund. They wasted our entire morning. I would NOT recommend this company.Checked out the Skeptical Chymist last night and was seriously disappointed by the food.  Had the Cod Cakes and they were unacceptable.  Basically, it tasted like someone took several scoopfuls of Shake N' Bake, mixed them with with a VERY small amount of fishy substance and baked it.  There was a decent side of mac salad but it was room temperature which makes me a little queasy.  

I'll go back for drinks but I'll stay away from the "pub grub."Typical fastfood quality. Now I remember why I don't go here. Chicken in the chicken sandwich was falling off in between the bread. Lettuce was all over the bag. Save your money, head down Pecos and checkout Parsley's for a good, quality lunch.I'd like to begin this review with a warning...WARNING: Oscar the Grouch works at this location! 

I pull up to the drive-thru at 5am this morning to order a drink for me and my friend. Little miss Grouchy gets on the other end full of attitude and scorn. She asks for my order and interrupts me as I am in the middle of my statement saying "is that all?" with a snappy tone. Which completely throws me off, I finish my order but can't believe her tone the whole time she is talking with me. I drive around to the window and she got my drink wrong! (maybe she should have LISTENED to the whole thing...any ways I hand back my drink so she can make another one and she slams the drink into the trash and refuses to look at me. She maintains a permanent scorn on her face and when she finally hands me my corrected drink, I say, "thanks, have a good morning." she slams the window on me! I don't have the highest expectations for any drive-thru, but Starbucks always promotes their friendly service and my experiences at other Starbucks have always been pleasent; so I am shocked this Starbucks is still open. When those 100 odd stores closed a few years ago, this one should have been one of them.

This isn't the first time I have come to this location and had to correct my order at the window, in fact getting my order RIGHT is an exception! I can't believe a company like Starbucks would have stand for such low quality in service.I went in on tuesday to buy slip resistant shoes for work. I have a lot of issues with my feet and have problems finding shoes I can wear for 12 hours a day. I bought some new Balance which on the box said they were slip resistant and oil resistant and the only ones they carried. I was advised not to wear them out otherwise I could not return them. I wore them around the house that night and was slipping all over the place. I knew I could not wear them for work. I looked on the receipt and low and behold it said no returns only exchanges. When I went there to return them on friday, there was a little sign by the cash register that said the same. Unfortunately I paid for them on the other side of the register and could not see it. If I was told that, I might have thought twice about buying them. I was never told anything. The guy was very rude when I brought them back and said if I was in more dire need or 80 yrs old he might have written me a "pass" to take them home and try them????? Really???? You don't know my situation????? You lost a customer and a referral. I wil never refer anyone to you. Obvioudly, guest satisfaction is not in your vocabulary.Terrible, ordered foie gras and it was the worst. Don't order this.yuck. The hype is just hype.this is my favorite Vegas restaurant,it gets only 1 star thanks to their bartender Eric and their non response to my email about my dining experience and run in with Eric.
As usual the food was wonderful,wine amazing,but I will not be back,I will not buy my friends $500. gift certificates for christmas gifts all because the management glossed over my email,and did not find it important to address my concerns.
I will miss dining at B&B,there are other great places to eat in Vegas
So long B&BThree of us checked in to Caesars on a decent deal that we thought was a great deal.  After walking from the parking lot to the lobby which we schlept our luggage approximately a half mile (No exaggeration)  We checked in and schlept  the luggage for another half mile.  We got to our room opened the door and found it to be occupied.  Tired of walking, I contacted a maid and tried to explain the problem, after she realized what I was saying she stated "that happens often"  I telephoned the front desk and was immediately given an upgrade.  So I had to return to the lobby and get the new room key.  We were directed to a new tower.  Upon entering I noticed the room looked nice.  When going to take a shower the shower tile was full of black mold, the water drained slowly and the previous residents hair was stuck to the drain.  Several phone calls to fix the problem and plenty of exasperation.  

12 dollars for 3 k cups of coffee, 25 dollars to use the gym, internet was not free (i used my hot-spot so I don't know the cost)  7 dollars for a beer in the refrigerator, but considering that was the price for a beer at the bar at least they are consistent.   The prices throughout the casino were high, this caused me to leave the Casino and go to a casino that at least had decent prices.  A beer at a local casino was $ 2.75, I put the rest into the slots. Caesars is too big to fail!, and to big to manage.  Wynn, encore, mirage is much better.  Caesars should hire Steve Wynn to decorate the place.  Might help, though i'll never go back.** WORST EXPERIENCE EVER... like E-V-E-R !

Went to a little Mexican eatery at Caesars Palace.  My husband almost ate a rusty industrial staple, that was in his black beans.  My husband bit into it and his face dropped when he pulled it out and identified it as a large industrial staple.  I quickly went and spoke to an employee of the eatery- telling them what was found.  They told me to wait at the table for the proper people to arrive (to record the incident).  My husband wanted to leave right then and go to the ER to get a tetanus shot.  I was upset/shocked and wanted to speak to someone... 45 MINUTES LATER... I start really looking around.. and noticing something strange.  There are three men around us... sitting at tables alone.. AND THEN I REALIZE THEY ARE FILMING US!!!!!!!!!!!!!  THEY ACTUALLY were sitting there for the past- who knows how long FILMING US with their camera phones.....  I WAS SOOOOOOOOOOO ANGRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I said to one of the men YOU GET ME SOMEONE NOW!!  All three men scattered like cockroaches.  Within 2 mins someone was there to take a report.  I said why were there men video taping us for the last 45 mins?!?!  The man said he didn't know- it was part of security...  What a terrible experience.  Horrible.. Ruined our trip.. left the next day since my husband was sure he was going to get some infection from the rusty staple.. he promptly got his tetanus shot.Very disappointing, tasteless and expensive for what you get.One of the highlights of the bachelor party that I organized was meant to be a VIP table at the PlayBoy Club.  Despite the emailed confirmation from Jillian Parrish at the hotel, $1200 hold on a credit card and assurances that the Palms would charge us if we did not turn up,  they did not actually HAVE a table for us when we arrived.  The door staff were rude and were more interested in looking cool than actually helping customers with legitimate beefs.  Our door guy Jevan, was focused on finding pretty girls and giving them access rather than getting our VIP table sorted.   He finally consented to let us in with no charge - VERY generous considering the Palms almost ruined the bachelor party highlight. no apology for the f*ck up, let alone a free drink was offered.  I was simply told that I was the fourth VIP table that they'd been unable to accommodate so far that night.   Do not bother.  Try Pure instead...or if you are at a bachelor party  - head over to Sapphires.Looks like a great place, and probably is for hanging out and having some drinks with friends.  For lunch or dinner - I would pass!  The positives:  Good drinks/cocktails. The negatives: Kids eat free every day however the waitress tried to charged us for two kids meals.  My son's milk was sour.  The cheese on the nachos was poured (cheese sauce) on instead of melted on.  The plate was super hot when the waitress put it in front of him.  The rice and beans tasted like they came from a can......I think you get the point.Food that your dog may not choose to eat. Yes, it's that bad. Eat here at your own risk.Horrible! The guy doing my gel dint know what the hell he was doing they had to redo it 3x and in the process of buffing out my nails and further damaging it. The buffing cut the edge of my cuticles and now I'm in pain Everytime I wash my hands they offered to take $5 off I dint want to argue anymore so I said okay. The gel is terrible when I got home and took a hot shower it bubbled up! So disappointingB&N is one of my favorite places. But these jerks insist on LOCKING the plugs in the cafe! I wanted to plug my phone in, and when they noticed that it was plugged in (thanks to an unlocked plug box thanks to an anemic day) they insisted I remove it and locked the damn plug! If this company keeps sliding down they cannot afford to drive off paying customers by not letting them plug in their devices; devices that everyone has these days. Avoid this place if these assholes have giant sticks in their assholes and will not even let people come in and plug their devices in while studying or reading or whatnot. I would have emailed them directly... but the stupid website will not let email in unless one has an account! This company, and this store in particular, I am beginning to think, deserves to fail with policies like this in place.One star for the raw chicken they served me. Nice Pizza Hut.  My bad for going here I guess.  Hope I don't get sick from it.  I take back any good experience I may have had with them because of this.   

They did take 50% off the meal, but I was so grossed out it was hard to eat anything else and I think if you get served RAW CHICKEN you should be comped the entire meal.  Sounds fair to me.First, we love Costco and have shopped there for 20+ years but this specific location frustrates me to no end. I'm to the point where I can't stand going in this store because it is such a zoo as it covers way to large of area/population. They really need to build another further west in Goodyear.

We went in the store Sunday evening about 4:30pm. We got four items and stood in the long lines to check out. One of the items required us to pick up the item at the secure cage at the front of the store so after we checked out when walked to the cage where there were six employees and a Supervisor named Jason.

I wanted to get away from the crowd so I left the receipt with my wife and walked about 30 feet away and stood out of the way of people while she waited to get our item out of the cage. I watched for 10 minutes while each employee took turns working on the computer near the cage while the Supervisor Jason looked over their shoulder. Each one would finish on the computer and walk right past my wife who was standing right in front of the desk with her hand and receipt resting on the desk waiting for someone to ask to help her. None of the six employees or the Supervisor even looked up at her and just ignored her.

I got upset since it had now been 10 minutes plus so I walked over there and took the receipt and stood there waiting to be helped. 5 more minutes and four more employees walked right past us and would not help us.

I finally lost it and yelled "does anyone work here that will help us", to my surprise one employee who doesn't even have access to the cage looked up from working on the computer and said "oh, I thought someone was helping you" and the Supervisor Jason turned away from us and walked away. I said "no, we've been standing here for 15 minutes and over 10 employees have ignored us.

She took our receipt and said "Jason can you get this out of the cage for them" and he turned around with a disgusted look and got the item for us without saying a word.

This is definitely the worst managed Costco we've been to and we've lived all over the country in 30 years of military life.Rude shop. They speak in Vietnamese the ENTIRE time you're there. She spoke 4 English words total. If you're providing services to English speaking people- SPEAK ENGLISH in their presence!!!!I begrudgingly filled my compounded prescriptions at Melrose Pharmacy for over a year before becoming so fed up I couldn't take it anymore.  The problems started small enough that I didn't mind so much - prescription not ready when I got there, very slow check out and spotty customer service.  After a few times of the Rx not being ready when I arrived, I started calling ahead to see if it was ready.  3 times in a row I was told that it wasn't ready because they hadn't heard back from my doctor.  When I checked with my doctor, my doctor's office said they had spoken with Melrose.  Then, I moved and Melrose offered to mail my prescriptions across town.  The problem is they didn't mail them and they sat in the bin waiting for me to pick up until I called to find out what the problem was.  That occurred 2 times.  I spoke with the Manager who said she'd rectify it.  It happened 2 more times.  

The end all was when they mailed a prescription to me and the expiration date on the medication was already past.  I called and they apologized.  I asked how this could happen because someone had clearly initialed the bottle, leading me to believe that it had been checked.  They had no answer.  But I was told a new bottle would be mailed that day.  Later that day, someone from Melrose called to get my credit card information because they needed to charge me AGAIN for the prescription.  I explained I wasn't going to pay for it because I had already paid for the expired drug that I couldn't use.  That was the straw that broke the camel's back.  

You need to be able to trust your pharmacy.  Even a small mistake can be fatal to someone.  I have no faith in Melrose and have found a new pharmacy that is far more professional.I made a quick trip here to get a tiara for the birthday girl before heading to her birthday dinner. I was planning to be in and out within 5 minutes, but that didn't go as planned. I chose the tiara with no problem because they didn't have a big selection for adults. I proceeded to the checkout counter, and this was where my patience was tested.

I was next in line while another woman was being checked out. She left to find another item that she could purchase. Fine, she couldn't be that long, right? Wrong! There were three workers there, so I asked the girl at the counter if anyone else could check me out. I had one item in hand, which could have easily been rung up and done within 2 minutes, max. Her response, "yes, he could, but he's busy with the balloons." Really? You couldn't ask him to quickly ring me up? Would I be taking him out of his helium filled wonderland? 

I stood there for what seemed like forever, staring at all three, and they all stared back. No one did or said anything. Finally, one of them came to her senses and asked "are you ready to be checked out?" Uh, really? No, I was just standing here because I have nothing better to do with my time.

It might be time to hire people over the age of 15, because this kind of customer service will surely keep people away. If you have a lot of time to kill, and like staring contests, be my guest!I'm utterly terrified of this store. I opt to drive a few miles to Frys instead.I had a dead battery so I called the store and they said they had my size so I drove right in. Surprise, surprise they were out of the battery at the price they quoted me but had another for just $50 more than their phone quote.

Every time I went into the store they always tried to up-sell me for something is didn't need or want. I checked with my regular mechanic and everything they recommended
I didn't need.I just couldnt take it any longer! What a waste of time and money to just try and use their services (extremely, painfully slow internet) overpriced cable with a billion channels and nothing I WANT to watch - tons of garbage filler channels that you HAVE to wade through to find something good, and then when the crappy product goes from painful to use to not working at all you get the EXACT SAME results from their customer service!  Painfully slow, cant find anyone who can actually help with the problem, and unexpected charges for everything!

I finally cancelled the whole thing because it was just as useful unplugged and in a box in the garage!  After another excruciating experience just TRYING TO CANCEL! I move on thinking it's all in the past and I wont have to deal with them again.  BUT, that's when the deluge of offers in the mail come in wanting me back, touting their awesome service, incredible prices, and happy customers! Really? 

Then I start getting calls wanting me back. This time the people are quite friendly even though I'm irritated and dump on them about how they failed over and over before they lost my business.  Still they keep calling and are quite pleasant.  Then it occurs to me... this is where they put all of their good people - on the phones trying to get pissed of customers back!

Too little, too late.  I'm extremely happy without all of the frustration.  Now I just use my iPad and stream a movie from Netflix now and then if I want to.  Much better, cheaper, and i don't have to deal with people that makes my head want to explode!I just paid $25for the worst gel manicure of my life. After being rejected from my usual place because they were too busy, I went to Cindy and Danny's which was down the street. Their selection of gel colors was smaller than most places but I found a color and let the lady know. The color she started painting was completely different than the one I chose, but with an attitude she let me choose another. I settled on one of the dark reds and she got to work. After a while I realized that she was using color 440 instead of 441 like I had asked for but she had ready almost finished my hand and I was too shy to say anything, especially after the look she have me for switching before. When she was all done and my nails should have been dry, another guy came over with some alcohol substance and began wiping   my nails. My thumb smudged as a result. The other lady came back and accused me of hitting it, and from then on guided my hand like I was an idiot. When she redid my thumb she used color 441 instead of 440 that was on all of my other fingers. Also, don't they usually add a shines coat to the top? Mine look completely unfinished. Not to mention that I could have (and often do) paint my nails much better than she did.Went there today to pick up a couple of items. Waited to check out and both sales people were busy with other customers which took quite a while. That was no problem waited till they were done. Finally one of the clerks was free and instead of ringing up our two items told us someone had come in before us and he needed to check on him first. Seriously, we had waited in line more than 10 minutes and he couldn't take 30 seconds to ring us up!!!!!! The other customer was just browsing the store and hadn't even come up to the counter!!!!! We just put the items on the counter and left. Normally we buy our pool supplies from Leslie's but there are many pool supply stores in the valley and its time to take my money elsewhere. Won't be hard to find better customer service than this!!!!!!I have been doing business with Summer Winds Nursery for many, many years until yesterday. I arrived at 5:03 pm and was refused entry because they close at 5:00pm. I asked the employee who was at the gate letting customers out and preventing anyone from going in if they had a fungicide called "F-Stop" for my sick lawn. He said yes they have it but even though I would have been in and out in two minutes he refused me entry. Yes I was 3 minutes late but is this the way to treat loyal customers?Ugh. No. The place was cheap, I'll give it that. The food came out after a reasonable wait and the portion size was decent. But the food itself didn't taste like anything. Just super-bland. Also, the place could use some air-conditioning.Worse Mexican food I have ever ate!  I come from Ohio and had better food than this place!  Had a chicken dish with no seasoning or veggies!  Dried chicken with a dollop of creamy white sauce does not make a good dish.  The manager even came by and stated he would not charge me for the extra sauce I requested to help give the dish some flavor!  Also who serves a margarita in a water glass???? Never again, a waste of money!MY EXPECTATIONS WERE EXCEEDED!  I've been searching for so long to have a dinner experience that MET all of my expectations - for a restaurant that I SHOULD NEVER PATRONIZE.  Mimi's in Goodyear actually exceeded my expectations.  On Oct 26th, while visiting the area, I made the unfortunate mistake of recommending we dine at Mimi's because of previously good food and service there.  But, alas, if the old Mimi's quality still existed, they wouldn't have exceeded my expectations for WHAT NOT to experience in a restaurant.

Let me recant why YOU or ANY ONE ELSE (except those people you truly dislike) should never patronize this facility.  First of all, the interior temperature was at least 80 degrees (when it was less than 65 outside).  We had to ask for the air conditioning to be turned on.

Next, we ordered the artichoke dip appetizer.  It looked funny.  It tasted funny.  The tortilla chips actually resembled pita chips.  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it must be a ______.

I ordered the chicken cordon bleu which is supposed to be served with "seasonal vegetables" and "homemade mashed potatoes".  Can someone explain to me how MIXED seasonal vegetables can be served where the brocolli is steaming hot, but the carrots mixed with them are literally still frozen in the middle?  That's a feat.  My "homemade" mashed potatoes?  Cold.  A sliver of butter placed on top of the mashed potatoes would not even melt to graphically show our waitress "the problem" .  Even after this effort, no offer from the wait staff (or manager-missing-in-action) was ever made to either warm up the potatoes, replace them ......or, perhaps, use them as wall spackling.

After all this, they sincerely asked us if "everything was all right" and "would we care to order dessert".  At least they have a sense of humor.

Never again.So Emily at the PUW couldn't answer my question about a salad that was on the menu so she says "just a sec" and then disappears without any explanation.  Then a young man continues the conversation.  I ask the weight of the salad and he tells me "just a minute."  He comes back and tells me they aren't a set amount, they all vary.  I inquired about the type of apples on one of the salads and I'm told red and green.
I'm tired of ordering food and the employees knowing nothing about what they're selling.  No clue how many ounces in the beverages, no idea the weight of meat on a sandwich or what toppings are on it so they have to put you on 'hold" so they can ask someone else.
I accept this lack of info, complete my order, pay, and as I begin to drive off I observe two guys and at least one girl finding this situation particularly humorous.
So the (clueless) customer is funny now?

Bleu cheese on my salad was warm which seems strange.
Thanks for making my dining experience after a long day of volunteering, painting, and then yardwork a pleasant end of the day.If the crime maps and the ghetto bird roaming at night don't scare you away from midtown, hopefully this review will. Here is my list of crazyness I experienced at the infamous Midtown on Main. 

1. GHETTO ASS NEIGHBORS: 
(a) Across from our apartment lived a couple who enjoyed having parties monday-thursday. On the weekdays when people with jobs were asleep, these people would be out on their balcony talking extremely loud. No joke, they always invited another couple who ALWAYS got into a fight. From midnight to 3:30 in the morning we'd hear the couple fight. The man would call her a dumb bitch, an effing c*nt... you name it, he said it. Then he'd leave and you'd hear the woman crying about how it's the last time and she's done putting up with his sh*t. Ok the first time I heard it, it was sad. But every week? really? No respect for herself or the neighbors!

(b) To the left of us lived a woman who hung out in her pajamas all day and loved yelling and cussing at her kids. This woman's kids were out of control.... they'd play video games late at night and turn the volume on full blast. They'd shoot airsoft guns at night or honk a blow horn. It was non stop with these kids and it was always super late at night. They were out of control. The dad of this household was missing for a while ( we assume he was locked up)... one night when my husband went to check the mail, he saw the woman making out with some dude at the playground who wasn't her babies daddy!! sketchy sketchy. 

(c) We lived above these girls who we're disgusting. They would take out their trash and leave it at their door for several days!!! They'd had 4-5 bags sitting outside their door in the heat! The smell was awful. If they decided to throw out the garbage, they'd drag the bags and garbage would be all over the stairs. Sometimes they would leave the bags of garbage at the bottom of the stairs! It was so confusing! Like are you planning on having someone else throw that away for you? 

(d) There was a random lady who would walk through the complex pushing a shopping cart and crying. Crying really loud. One night, not sure if it was her, but I woke up to someone walking through the complex crying and moaning super loud. Can you say creepy? 

(e) Our car got vandalized. 

OK still not convinced this place is terrible?

(2) INCOMPETENT STAFF: 
(a) After our first month living here, we got a notice on our door that we owed over $50 because they gave us the wrong rate. Apparently, the girl who we signed our lease with made a mistake. Um, pretty sure you can just randomly decide that our rent is higher. We signed a contract. We refused and they said ok.

(b) Our pool key had difficulty opening the gates to the only 2 pools they decided to keep open. (btw pools are never heated). Sometimes it would take 3-4 people to figure out the gates because everyone's keys didn't work! One lady told me to demand a new key because the office staff was reluctant to give her a new one. I decided to go one day and ask one of the guy's in the office and he kept questioning me like I was lying to him! He kept saying "really? your key isn't working? I bet you it will work for me". OK guy, do you want to accompany me every time I go to the pool? I honestly don't understand why they were so hesitant to give people new keys. 

(c) One of the maintenance guys is a fricken prick.  One time my husband went to pick up a package that was sent to me, and when the girl went to get the package, the maintenance guy questioned my husband and asked "is she even on the lease?". Um what? who are you? Another time they had left a note on everyone's doors saying that everyone had to take down their patio shades and request an approved shade from the office. After receiving this notice, my husband spoke to the office staff TWICE and inquired about the shade. We were told that they had put in a request for a shade for us, and would notify us when one became available. While we waited for our new shade, we received a threat of eviction because we weren't using one of their patio shades! My husband went into the office upset at the threat and the maintenance guy jumps in and basically tells my husband he shouldn't be upset because everyone received a notice about the patio shade. UM okay, again, who are you? The girl in the office apologized for the notice and took out the eviction threat from our file. 

LASTLY, upon moving out, the manager refused the do a walk through with us. Somehow whenever we were available, no one in the office was. They did the walk through without us and we got charged for a crack in the mirror that was already there when we moved in! LAME. If you still decide to live here, make sure you always make a copy of your rent checks and watch out for bugs. We were clean, but bugs loved popping up everywhere. Also beware of the train that comes right by the complex and blows its horn at 3 in the morning. well, good luck.i really dont like going to this walmart. yes the shelves are always stocked, but when it comes to checking out and customer service talk about horrible service. walmart can be packed on a saturday but they only decide to open about 3-4 lanes. they have so many check out lines... USE THEM WALMART! The waiting and the non caring attitude the staff shows really kills the shopping experience.Absolutely the worst experience ever. Not only was my burger made wrong, I mean it was extremely difficult - mayo, mustard, pickles, lettuce tomato and cheese. what did I get? Ketchup, 3 lousy pickles, a smidge of mustard and lettuce and tomato. The burger was also cold. And I don't mean warm, it was cold. Disgusting. I will never be back to this Carl's Jr. Maybe not to any of them.LA Fitness needs to work on their customer service. My first visit to Avondale I asked for a tour. The snippy little blond that showed me around seemed get an attitude because I asked questions and told her that when I signed up I received a free hour of training. She kept insisting they don't have free training!  Then I got sick had to have surgery and didn't use the membership.  Once I got well decided I was going to start going the next week.  Just so happens my bank changed my debit card and I didn't update it. Got a call that my payment didn't go thru.  Explained the situation to the person that called me and told her I would go online that evening and update my card.  Was told that would be necessary as she would take my number over the phone.  I told her I was driving down I-10 on my way to work and I couldn't give it to her right now...she hangs up in my face.  OK I'M DONE!!!!  I don't do bad customer service.  Called the number back and told the manager what happened and asked to cancel my membership.  She got an attitude too telling me that I should just pay my bill and no one would bother me.  Asked to have my membership cancelled.  I received a total of 10 calls in the next 7 days.  Asked for the number to corporate...it just gets you back to a customer service center.  They have so many complaints they don't want to bother their corporate office with a complaint.  DONE DONE DONE!!! Will never do business with them again.Really slow service! Won't be back. Should have trusted the reviews of my fellow YelpersWent by here for a last minute gift and the place is Out of Business....I used to frequent this place often but I will never return. Each time I come back it gets worse and worse. The service is terrible and always has been. Today when they served our food everyone at the table received it cold. We asked for them to heat it up and they returned with a black hair in it. We pointed that out to the manager and she laughed. Yes and no apology either. Also received a dirty cup of coffee all lipstick. No apology. Asked for a clean one and returned with the same cup. No apology. Some of our food came out wrong too. No apology. I usually can tolerate bad service if the food is good but it isn't. I can not stand filthy food either. I will never returnNEVER  go for anything other than a hangnail... Then make sure your manicurist goes with you!!!  Didn't follow through with test ordered.  Would not admit error.  I'm not sure what medical schools these Drs graduated from but coming from a medical family, wouldn't let my dog go there (if I had one).  I'll make sure to pay any co-pay the same way they followed through with my tests...The worst customer service ever.  I went shopping here with my little shorty and a sales clerk clearly hit her in the head with a backpack that she was carrying and just kept on walking.  I had to call the lady back and gave her a lesson in being polite to others like her momma should have done.

Then when it came time to pay we had to deal with this horrendous Snooki wannabe who didn't know how to work the register and treated me like it was my fault.  When she called someone over to help her, the two of them started fighting with each other and then Snookie pulled in a third guy and started bitching at him - no joke.  I wanted bash their heads together and walk out without paying but jail isn't really an option at this point in my life so I just put up with their crap.  I will never set foot in this store again.Everything everyone just said in there reviews is true! Plus they don't clean there rooms but every 7 days. Yes 7 days & they don't have room service you have to go down stairs to get your own towels & etc & you hope someone is at the front desk. This place doesn't even deserve a star more like a fallen star. Obviously I will not be coming back here again.Horrible experience and most awful customer service ever. I waited and waited and waited when I got there... I understand if it is busy but the least they could do is acknowledge the people waiting. The first car they gave me smelled like mold and cigarette smoke. It was so bad that I had to come all the way back (wait some more) and exchange the car out. They said I could get an upgrade for the inconvenience but of course nothing was available. To top it all off the temporary authorization they put on my car that they said was released went through... Now they won't even pick up the phone when I call. Awesome time. Oh wait... Just kidding.I don't normally expect good service from a chinese retaurant unless you're at a chained restaurant like P.F. Chang's. But this place is the worst both food and service. The younger gentleman with glasses at the counter is really rude. I was recommended to this place by a friend who said it's the best Chinese go to for him since he always do a take out order. Recently a young gentleman at the register screwed up his order as well. 

Funny story was, I was talking to my boss about Chinese restaurant and he mentioned Iron Chef where he took his family. We ended up talking and find out we were treated the same way from the same guy. We laughed it off and made joke about it all the time now.Unfortunately I'm still here - couldn't wait to write this review.  Bad service , bad food , small portions of over priced bad food.  In fact my wife's  dish and my dish were so small that combined they would be a smaller lunch entre at most restaurants.  Cafeteria style salad ,  cafeteria scent in the air as you come into this pathetic establishment.   Ordered lemonade - got crystal light .   If I could give it no stars I would ..I'm a HUGE fan of this chain, they have the best food. Always fresh, sourced local, and delicious.

Unfortunately this location has repeatedly been a let down with crunchy rice, dry black beans, stale chips, and the guac seems to have been frozen. All watery and grainy.
We're gonna have to drive a little further for a better location, which really sucks as this is the closest to our home.

FAILInitial experience left a HORRID TASTE IN MY MOUTH and I never even tried the food!!!!!

Just had an -interesting- conversation with the girl who answers the phone, Amanda. 
WOW.
After being asking what I was calling for (catering an event, duh!) I told her what I needed, I was put on hold, phone was answered again by Amanda who acted like she hadn't just talked to me 6 seconds before and asked the same question again. 

Her absolutely lack of professionalism quickly wore down my patience. I felt like I was dealing with a 15 year old!!

In the middle of asking me what our date was for our wedding, venue, etc., she blurts out "Oh, you know there is a 5k minimum for December. You know that, right?" 
I was baffled by the way she said this, as well as there was no surrounding explanation or context... When I asked "Why?" She laughed at me and then said "Well, thats just our policy." Okay, that's fine. There are much, MUCH better ways of presenting this to a prospective client. Also, you probably shouldn't say it to someone when you don't know what their budget is or how much they are willing to pay. Moreover, the condescending, rude tone in which you say things like that have a lasting effect. 

They don't know that they are on the preferred vendor's list at my venue, they don't know specific rules or things that the venue already provides and this girl seems to have no grasp of how to get details from someone without asking the most idiotic questions. If someone keeps saying "We just require a plated dinner, no other services from you." You don't need to keep asking things like "what about cake, what about a bartender, what about hors D'oeuvres?" "NO! Just a plated dinner." 

Total incompetence, lack of professionalism, rude, and absolutely not a business who I would recommend working with after this brief and exhausting exchange. 

I wanted to book a simple consultation to try to talk to a coherent adult about food, do a tasting, and then sign a contract --TO GIVE YOU MONEY--! 

To the owner of this business: 
(Before I completely wrote you off as my potential caterer) I requested that when I got my call back, I would like to deal directly with the owner, Jennifer. 
Amanda rudely asked "Why?!?" I told her that I would like to deal with someone who knows the venue that I am booked at, (considering you are a preferred vendor there). 
I would strongly suggest getting someone else who knows how to deal with customers, has a better "table-side manner", and knowledge of halfway decent customer service. 
I have had much more pleasant experiences with call center employees.Both myself and my relatives have visited this office and have had unpleasant experiences there.  Both of us went to their Gilbert location. I was extremely overcharged for my procedures. One procedure, a simple wart removal (freezing) which would have cost about 25 dollars at a walk in clinic, they tried to charge me 114 dollars for. I asked the billing staff to let me know if I would have any out of pocket costs before anything was done and to let me know so I could decide whether I wanted to have the procedures done or not. I was assured that everything would be covered by the insurance and that even based on my deductible I would have no out of pocket costs... then I got two bills totaling over 700 dollars. I feel like I was completely misled by this practice. Currently I would highly recommend Southwest Skin Specialists as an alternative as I've been going to them for several years and they are excellent and have better customer service.Bready bagels, not real bagels. Egg sandwich is terrible!  The egg tasted like dishwater!

This place make's Einstien's Bagels seem like geniuses!  And I'm no fan of chain-store bagels.

Stick with Chompies or Back East Bagels in Tempe for something more bagel-like, and a good breakfast sandwich.Wasn't a fan. The wings had no flavor and the fries we received looked and tasted like they were made 4 hours ago. Waitress was great. Watching games here isn't the best since the TV's are like 47 feet in the air.I used them for more than a year. They didn't show up half the time, and when my solar heater developed a leak they claimed they couldn't clean the pool at all (I suppose that using the shutoff valve never occurred to them). They continued to collect my money but not clean the pool. They charged me $25 extra whenever they cleaned the filter (a no-extra-cost item with my current service), never told me in advance when they were going to do it, and demanded payment for it on the spot before they left.If I did not so desperately need to use a u-haul trailor to haul a car back to arizona in a rush, I would have gladly went to a different U-Haul Co. After getting a quote prior to my arrival, not only did they give us the wrong price, as quoted on the phone, they pretty much had no recollection of ANY info I gave them on the phone I.e., I will be using my personal truck and NOT one of theirs.

When the worker came out, he acted like he dragging feet and was more interested in texting on his phone then hurrying and putting the hitch on the truck while I stood by.

I do not recommend their services to anybody.No stars for this place! I went there on Wednesday kids eat for$1 .. We got there and the assistant manager asked how many we where and I said 8, she mouthed"wow" they  sat  us down and the waiter took a while to come over.  When she does, she tells me I need 4 adults ( w/ ID) for the 4 kids meals I'm getting, I told her why do I need iDs if I'm paying for 4 regular meals n  4 kids meals isn't that the same... I just got "that's what the manager told me "not really keeping their word on that deal are they!
I left to a different location (Craig ) and had a total different experience!This was my 2nd time at this particular KFC. The first time was fine, but this time around...I waited about 7-8 minutes for my food! They were behind on the sides or something...and I'm not sure if this is normal for KFC or it's just this particular location, but the food was ...unsatisfying. 

I was disappointed with the amount of salt used to season the chicken. I couldn't taste anything but salt, salt and more salt. 

The cole slaw was a bit old and overly sweet. Overall a very bad meal that I will remember long enough to avoid KFC. I'd rather have chicken at McDonald's.I almost always wash my own car. But sometimes I get a case of the lazy ass and want to bring it somewhere. Coming here was my punishment for being lazy!

For some reason I've given this place a few chances. They've always failed me. I have always had to wait at the greeting station for minutes for an employee to come and take my wash order. I worked at a car wash while in college and when I worked as the greeter we didn't leave our station. The greeting station is the first place any customer goes, and you should start off their experience correctly. Making a paying customer wait and wait is not a great start.

The wash tunnel is pretty crappy too. It's a slight touch better than what you'd find at a BP station. And for the price you pay here, I'd really expect it to be better. Then you drive your car over to the vacuuming and drying area. I have a Mini Cooper, which is a small car, yet I've had it take them 20 minutes to run the vacuum hose on the front floor boards and the crappily dry the outside. 

They're not through either, I've always had spots and missed areas. The most recent visit, the idiot kid used a dirty rag that either had armor all or tire shine on it on my paint, which immediately smudged and looked like shit on my dark exterior. And instead of clean it, he called me over to discover, which immediately lead me to complain about. He just shrugged. Which resulted in my best Soup Nazi impression: "No tip for you!"

I advise you to just wash your car at home or go pump a few tokens into a self service car wash like the one right down the road. They over-charge for under-performance.I keep trying this place once a year and I never learn my lesson. Not good Italian food. Just go for a sandwich or burger. Tonight on 10/7/13 our server was poor. Prices have gone up too. Why???  Again just go for a sandwich.Came to Morton's for restaurant week. The price was $50.13 per person and they had a special menu where you could pick between a couple different things. We started out with a large loaf of onion bread. The bread wasn't bad but I could only eat so much. Next came the French onion soup. I could have picked up and drank it in 3 gulps it was so small. The soup had a very bland flavor. Then my steak and sides came. The filet was cooked the way I asked and didn't taste bad but certainly isn't worth what they are charging. I have had better steak at high end steakhouses on the strip. The sides I shared with my wife, we had the sour cream mashed potatoes and lyonnaise potatoes. The mashed was not bad but the lyonnaise potaotes were just gross. The onions were very overcooked and chewy. The potatoes weren't at all what my wife showed me in other pictures on yelp. Then came dessert. I chose the strawberry cheesecake and it couldn't have been anymore flavorless. The portions for restaurant week were way smaller then if you just came in and ordered from their regular menu which is a scam to me. The food just wasn't good and a waste of money.

Our server was very good. He checked on us often. One of the servers mentioned that Morton's was undergoing a remodel and said we were lucky to be seated in a booth in the corner because then we wouldn't be bothered by dust like some other customers. You should never ever talk about that with people about to eat in your restaurant.  

The parking sucks. The front of the restaurant is reserved for valet only. All other patrons must park behind the restaurant and walk around. Not very classy.I'm only giving this 1 star because I cannot give it negative 10. From the moment we met with the first Showtime tours staff we were instantly put off, talked down to, and belittled.  The man at the booth barked at us to move down to another booth to get our shuttle bus vouchers printed.  Then we waited in a short line of about three people that should have only taken minutes, but instead took nearly an hour. It was not without incident though as Tammy screamed at the patrons to move behind the line. When we finally made it to the window to be "greeted" by none other than the angelic Tammy. We were pretty proud of ourselves for having our email with our travel itinerary pulled up to show Tammy just like the instructions said. Tammy was not as delighted as we were. Tammy balled at us for not printing it out. Tammy handed us a scrappy business card and told us to forward the email to her. Well the email was incredibly long with uppercase lowercase letters special characters and numbers. We managed to send it four times ,but not quick enough for Tammy who told us to step aside but not to the empty space to the right but back to the left in the sea of people. After Tammy finished arguing with the lady behind us for not printing out her travel vouchers, she came out to give us our print out. Then the line for the shuttle bus. This is where we met the even more pleasant Joelito, the driver. He too like to yell at patrons and scold them for not having paperwork in 2014.  I think we would have been more comfortable hitchhiking with a family of clowns in a tiny car. Take a cab you'll thank me.Went to the pharmacy here today.  Their sign says that when there is only one pharmacist on site, they will be closed for 30 minutes between the hours of 1:30 and 2:30 P.M.  I arrived at 1:40 P.M.and they were closed but I assumed at the most I would have to wait untill 2:10 (30 minutes later).  They didn't open until 2:25 P.M. which is 45 minutes by my count and remember... I don't know what time they closed up.  Could have been earlier than 1:40.  So I politely asked the clerk how long their break actually was and she said 30 minutes.  When I told her my story she just repeated that it was 30 minutes, in effect calling me a liar.  She was not very friendly and I swear I was not confrontational. If they are going to be closed more than 30 minutes they should adjust their sign.  
P.S.  This is not the first time I've observed this.  Just the first time I've bitched about it.Finally made it back to Vegas after about 6 weeks. Called ahead and made arraingments for Sears to pick up my appliances. They were to have called the night before to give a time frame. No call. So the next morning I called them. I was told that they had no record of my call. I was then told that it had been over 30 days, so they were not going to pick them up. I explained that it was not my fault that the delivery crew told me they had no room on the truck when they delivered. I also explained that I lived in Vancouver, WA and only came to my Vegas home when time permitted. I was told that it "wasn't their problem". 
 Sears had told me in the first place that I could call when I got back to town and said nothing about a time limit.
 I think that this incident goes to show why Sears is in financial trouble.
 Myself nor many people I have talked to will ever set foot in a Sears or Kmart again.
 Frankly, I won't miss them at all as I have never missed Montgomery Ward.Made reservations for Valentines, asked if they can cater to vegans, I was told yes by three different people, we were seated at our table in a bad spot under the stairs, then were told that we do not cater to vegans in a rude manner, the waiter said, "This is a French restaurant." as if we're retarded. The waiter did not bother to help us out and ask his chef if it would be possible since it's a holiday, and also that it will be difficult to get reservations anywhere else on this particular night. So I will never set foot in Mandalay Bay ever again. Thanks for ruining our night!...But it's okay we had a great night somewhere else not located in Mandalay Bay/The Hotel.We rented a car from Hertz for our last day in Las Vegas through AAA. The price was ok and the pick up was in the hotel right next door to us (Paris), and we could drop it off right at the airport. There were 2 issues that I had. First of all, I was talked into "filling up the tank there because the prices were cheaper." The agent specifically said that going to the West Rim of the Grand Canyon would "use almost a full tank of gas." So of course I opted to pay for a full tank of gas at the counter, so I wouldn't have to fill it up later. Now, these agents are VERY familiar with the area. It took only a HALF TANK of gas to get there and back! Was totally scammed into purchasing this gas. Could have filled it up for 20 bucks, instead I paid them $44. Then, I opted to pay cash when I dropped it off, rather than use my credit card. Of course there was a line at the Hertz counter at the airport (McCarran) with only 2 agents. All I wanted to do was pay, but I had to wait in the same line as people who were about to rent, which can take a while. When I finally got to the counter, THEY HAD NO CHANGE for the cash I paid!! Of course I had a plane to catch, so they got even more money out of me. Next time I will choose another companyWe were looking for cheap but not at the expense of our safety! Where was security both nights we wanted to return to our rooms without a weirdo waiting for entrance to the elevator with us.. also the carpet was horribly stained and the bathtub flooded above the ankles during a shower. NO THANKS!I've been hearing a lot about this place lately and finally tried it tonight. Lets just say my stomach hasn't felt right since. I got the chipotle shrimp bowl and my boyfriend got a shrimp quesadilla. Both looked very unappetizing once delivered to our table. After a couple bites of my bowl, the cilantro was so overpowering that It was hard to finish it. Don't get me wrong, I love cilantro, this was just toooo much.

Another thing I found pretty gross were the bathrooms. Maybe its just me but I tend to judge the cleanliness of restaurants based on the restrooms. This one was smelly and in need of some scrubbin'.I bought a van on eBay, worst dealer I have ever dealt with. It appears others feel the same, you would be better off with a plumber working on your car. They would not fix what there staff screwed up. Your better off if they don't work on your car.DO NOT RECOMMEND!
We stayed at Trump because it was rated a 5 star hotel.
We were not happy nor would we stay or recommend anyone to stay there. 
My wife and I enjoy the amenities a property has to offer, Trump was very limiting. We usually enjoy a hot tub in the evening and the pool closed at 5pm. We work out in the early morning and go to the hot tub after our workout, the hot tubs didn't open until 9am, poor service for guests. Their fitness center was no where near what a 5 star hotel should offer. Very poor and not enough equipment along with being too small. They have a shuttle service that takes you to two different locations. However, they are not very timely or organized in what they are doing. They say the shuttle comes by every 15-20 minutes, however we were late to our dinner reservations due to the shuttle being over 30 minutes late in returning. 
Our room was nice however, it was not very clean. The first shower we took the water didn't drain well. When I rubbed my foot over the drain, a big clump of hair was moved... GROSS, not mine! The floor we were on must have had an earlier water leak problem. The carpet was raised and wrinkling, it had an odor of a water problem and like the carpet was still wet. 
The only good thing about the hotel was the staff, they were very friendly if you asked them anything and helpful at check in and check out, and confirming our plane flight. 
Price is too high for what they offer, they ride the name of Trump and charge what the name thinks it's worth, not worth it at all!We ate there in January, and it was FREEZING inside the restaurant! I got catfish that was greasy and tasteless. (Which is the only reason that I'm glad that the portions are TINY!) My husband got the pulled pork that was served fairly cold. French fries were cold, too.Food was terrible and service was even worse.  We will not be back....there is a reason this place is going down the tubes.Planet Hollywood is a lipstick covered Aladdin hotel. Although the rooms seem upgraded, the cleanliness and overall up keep was terrible. We were there for 2 nights and had to switch rooms 3 times. Last thing you want to do is wake up in the morning and not be able to shower because the drainage system doesn't work and your ankle deep in sudsy water and grim. They told us we had to wait to switch room until the evening. After insisting with them to switch rooms immediately they did only to find out our next room was filthy. Hair and grim on the bath tub, shower and toilet bowl, food crumbs in pillow cases and dust bunnies everywhere. In addition the sinks didn't drain properly again. So ended up switching to another room late afternoon, wasn't clean again but we were fed up. They offered to waive a $40 resort fee but when check out came there was no manager and the agent didn't honor the $40 resort fee waive. Honestly it wasn't worth it, a cheaper hotel on the strip was not worth the hassle we went through for a clean room. Id rather spend the extra $$ and go back to Bellagio, Venetian or any of the newer ones.When I tried to complain at checkout they told me all the managers were busy and that I could call in and a manager would try and do something for me.  When I called the next day, the manager Roberto said that there is nothing he can do.  Really? I'm sure if he stayed in his own hotel and had to switch 3 separate rooms they would have comped him or even made his stay more enjoyable.  This hotel is the worse one I've ever been to on the strip and the way they treat their guests is terrible.  Never go to this hotel.  It's not worth it.1st call - quoted 175 as part of the group rate for wedding i was attending (i had to decide if i ws staying there or not so I did not book)

2nd call - told group rate not avail any longer as all rooms in group were occupied. now quoted 225

Finally, I am called my group organizer, a room has become avail in the group. perfect. I am never told that the rate is now 300 though, I find this out when I am checking in.

I stayed one night, I wasn't impressed, despite the extensive remodeling in the rooms this still looks like an old apartment complex on the outside. 

Woke up at 845 in the morning on sunday by the idiot outside my window running a gas powered leaf blower. 

Any RESORT that allows their staff to use gas powered leaf blowers simply doesn't get it. Allowing it before checkout time any day is absurd. 

I will never return, I would suggest you look elsewhere. 

Scottsdale is filled with high end resorts that are significantly nicer than this one.Very disappointing.  Our group of four ordered salads, tofu ravioli, seafood linguine and seafood risotto.  OK at best.  Nothing was actually good and it was fairly expensive.  I don't know how this place stays in business.  I suppose people like the location and the old look and feel, but I will certainly not be back.Burrito with chorizo had far too much chorizo. I requested light chorizo yet it was so overloaded I couldn't see or taste the egg. Wondering why they say they will make it with light chorizo and yet they never do. I'd prefer you mention up front if there is no possibility in decreasing the amount used..... This prevents setting one up for disappointment.Please don't stay at this hotel. It's horrible and very unclean place. Our housekeeping didn't clean the room only made the beds and did some cleaning on the bathroom. Didn't change the sheets of the bed and the pillows smell so bad. We used the washer and dryer and our cloth sting as iron.!! All the carpet was so dirty from the room and hall! Please stay away from this place!Came here the day after a typical crazy night out in Vegas. My go to soup to settle my stomach is galbi tang(short rib soup). Came here based on YELP reviews. The interior looks a fast food establishment which serves Korean food. Anyways, ordered the Kalbi tang. It came out in a large bowl. Problem #1: The soup was bland! I've never eaten bland Kalbi tang at a restaurant before. I added salt and then more and more. I think they plain forgot to add salt. Yuck! Problem #2: The short rib bones and meat must come out a midget cow because they were the smallest rib bones I've ever seen and the meat pieces were a joke. Regret eating here. My wife ordered their Kimchee fried rice but it was bland as well. The side dishes were meh.  Sorry but can't recommend this place for decent Korean food.Food is okay. Customer service is poor. I called today to ask if they are selling DXN coffee, a lady answered the phone she said "yes, I am busy. " I asked how much and she replied, " I'm not sure it's in my computer just come here for the price." VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERViCE!!!! She need some telephone etiquette, she answered the phone improperly And rude!Erm, this place is closed or out of business? I went there yesterday about midday. All I saw inside was a painter's bucket and a couple of office desks. Their website says they're "Now Open!" but unless they've moved (there was no sign indicating this) the place doesn't exist.Very disappointing. I went here on Yelpers recommendations. What a mistake.

I got the shrimp tempura udon. The broth was flavorless. At least the tempura was cooked well. Also got a flying fish roe sushi. VERY FISHY TASTING.

Two of my friends and I that ate the shrimp got sick. POISONED. The other friend didn't eat the shrimp and was fine. Punk.

Beware. Be scared.I can't comment on the food because we were unable to stomach the atmosphere long enough to eat there. The restaurant was empty and from the dark bar we were shouted at to sit where we'd like. The table we chose was filthy and when I pointed out that there was food all over it the waitress said that we had simply chosen the dirty table. Her temperament was clearly off and she was not happy to have patrons, although there was no one else in the entire place. We asked for water and waited for menus. The water glasses game smudged with prints and coated in food and we left without much hesitation. Very very disappointed in the service of such a "well reviewed" sushi spot.Very rude and unprofessional over the phone. We did not buy anything. Based on my experience and other comments, the ownership need to review their customer service and take action.Don't eat there if you are alone.  Should have been better service, the room on the right was closed.  Really crappy service and dry fish.I have no idea why anyone considers coming here I wish I would've read the reviews to this place before coming on my first Vegas trip. 

It's extremely small compared to all the other clubs you can go to. It's a local club so all the locals come here well at least that's what it seemed like. And it's just not my type of crowd and unless you get bottle service there really isn't any room to dance. It's ghetto at its finest.ClosedI may well be the one of the only people who did not like this place..
Maybe because my expectations were so high...  But I went to Aureole in the Mandalay Bay in Vegas last Thursday evening and the service was horrible..  And food extremely disappointing..  
Maybe it was an off night or something, but neither the food nor the service redeemed itself by the end of the night..  
The Amuse was not so amusing..  Some cauliflower soup thing that had no wow factor whatsoever..  We both had the foie gras appetizer which had way too much going on and the flavors just did not do it for me..  I mean foie gras is foie gras..  I love it in any preparation, but c'mon now..  
Then I had the Escolar, which is a fish that a adore!  Every time I have had it, it was so yummy and buttery and this time it was grilled, but completely overcooked and so dry and unseasoned it seemed..  I only had a couple bites and could not even bring myself to eat any more..  Yes, it was that bad..  MM had the Salmon and he let me try a bite of that and I thought 'Eh...'  I make better salmon than that...

And what's the deal with that ridiculous electronic wine tablet!?!  
I mean, what are they paying the Sommelier for?  We tried several times to have them get rid of it and they finally got it out of our way after saying so at least 3x...  So needless to say, the servers were extremely inattentive..
For dessert we shared the Artisan Cheese plate and there 7 or 8 different cheeses and they plopped it down in front of us with no explanation of what they were..  We tried to get someone's attention..  Anyone.  Nothin..
So we decided to just have a go at it and I tried to guess myself what cheese was what..  It was ridiculous..
Finally after a long while, we flagged someone down and 
they were like..  'Your server did not explain your cheeses?'  
'Uh, no, not at all...  Hello, a little attention here, please!..'
To top it off that person, was rude as well..  Not to mention the fact that the servers were too busy cleaning up and putting chairs and tables away, that we felt like 'the door couldn't have hit us faster in the ass on the way out' to boot..
Luckily the company was great, because the experience at Aureole was a complete disappointment..I hated this place from the moment we arrived at the hostess station, but I didn't pick the place and my friends were seemingly committed to it. We waited for 20 minutes for a table for 7, but they lost our name and then told us to go upstairs to the open air bar where there are no tables at all. What?! 

We went upstairs and sat at a couch/lounge area. The misters were SO strong that we were getting practically showered and thus wet. I asked the server if we could turn them off/down. She said, "I can't survive without them!" Well, I was certainly more concerned about her comfort than mine, or so she assumed. SERVER 1, ME 0  Then she tells me that she can't do separate checks. I argued, this is a bar, do we have to figure out how to split the bill among those people who are not in our party right next to us? Completely unlogical, and irritating. We weren't all eating, and we weren't all drinking. I lost this dispute. SERVER 2, ME 0. Next, you could see her counting how many were in our party. 7. The menu said, parties of 8 or more will be charged gratuity. We had 7. We saw her count. She charged us gratuity. SERVER 3, ME 0. At this point, I was so angry, I almost threw money at her and ran out.

Food was also terrible. 

Only positive might be the patio/view if I weren't being showered by misters. 

Hated this place. Wish I could rate in the negatives.If only no-star rating existed... :-/. despite the reviews, I was optimistic and STARVING post-work in the middle of the night. We walked in and saw one other couple eating, and no one was there to greet or seat us. Finally a worker came out and still he didn't greet or welcome us in a friendly manner... but usually very authentic Asian restaurants can be that way, so that wasn't a huge deal.

After being seated, our waiter stood in front of us watching television... Didn't take our drink order until I asked if they had coconut juice. He said yes and my bf ordered a coke. I was astonished when they brought out a coconut with the wrapping still on it and some kind of sauce smeared on the exterior, and it was only half full... it creeped me out so I didn't drink it, plus they brought out a can of coke, no cup with ice.

I was still hopeful that the food would make up for the odd service... so I ordered the Vietnamese udon with pork and shrimp and my bf ordered the fish porridge. I was overwhelmed with disappointment when they brought over my bowl and I smelled a very unappetizing scent .. I have a very keen sense of taste and smell and something was clearly wrong with the dish.. Whether the pork was going bad or the shrimp.. I couldn't figure it out. I tried squeezing some lime into it and adding hot sauce but that scent wouldn't leave the dish no matter what I did. My bf's dish was too sweet for porridge and the fish was undercooked, plus... It seemed as though the fish wasn't fresh. I took a bite and had to spit it out :(

I think it's time for this restaurant to do some serious evaluating .. service-0, food-1, pricing-2... for its own survival. 

Worst part was that no one even checked on us the entire time so they couldn't even tell if we were having a good or miserable experience. They gestured for us to pay at cashier without even coming to the table or looking at us directly.. Rude! Needless to say, we went up, paid the $24, left a tip, and decided never to go there again..I have such high hopes for DD... because it is just my favorite donut shop of all time when I was growing up in the tropics so when I saw the sign on my way to my hotel from a friend's house I could not help but screech to a stop!  It was 9PM (I know,  who buys doughnuts at 9PM right?) and when I pulled up to the drive through I was greeted with a "boring "  - "high welcome to dunkin donuts" -  that alone should have warned me of things to come but I kept my hopes up,  I ordered my usual Boston Creme Donut and a regular DD coffee.. answer? "sorry we're out of that we only have powdered sugar dipped donut"... I moved on without buying anything.  I figured it was late anyway.  

So I tried again in the morning as soon as I got up, I headed straight for the same DD drive thru... alas, they have coffee, croissant and.. NO DONUTS YET, they have not had their delivery for the morning (and it's 10AM already..c'mon did LVPD buy all of them?), seriously?   They directed me to another location just a few blocks up and of course, they don't have their morning delivery yet.  I seriously thought that they were making donuts in their shop until this experience.   So I didn't quit and tried again for the 3rd time, this time it's around 5PM (on my way home to LA), I got the donuts alright and my first bite was even more disappointing!   STALE DONUT??? it wasn't delivered til after 10AM and within 7 hours the donuts were already dry and stale?  DD.. you DDissaponted a big fan!  

Oh well, I'll give you another chance on my next trip to LV.Its amazing how much they are charging for their flavorless greasy food. I was so underwhelmed I felt obligated to write this here review, which is also appropriately underwhelming. The best thing about the meal was the iced tea. Oh, I guess the service was decent.Bad Food. Bad Bad Food.We like to listen to local bands and decieded to check out Zowie Bowie, we arrived early for seating, they were to start at 1030, at 1130 still no band, the lead singer was t here  zipping around in the crowd but not performing, we finally lett putting it down to a wasted night.I really thought this place would of worked out from all the decent reviews it had...  The only thing that I liked was the fact they have the triangle shaped mozzarella "sticks", hey were our appetizer. The staff seemed friendly and it really seemed like we were going to make it through the experience without any issues!

The pizza came out, it looked good, smelled good.  But it just didn't taste right... as if something had spoiled or was not kept at the right temp... I say this because it was VERY odd on the ride home I felt this RUSH of nausea hit me.  We got home & I thought to myself, "dang this pizza was the only thing we both had all day!"

So 25 minutes later from when we left this place.  I turn to my boyfriend and asked him, "Do you feel really ILL? Like Nausea?"  He nodded and we both had this disgusted look our faces hoping for the best. NOPE! I was violently sick FIRST, and then him soon after.  It hit both of us without warning & thank god... we have 2 bathrooms.  I'm super upset, it was overpriced AND GOT US SICK?  I don't think that was a conicidence at all.

My boyfriend called (after we gathered what was left of our strength, I had a sore throat all day).  The manager had the NADS to ask if we were SURE it was his food.  No, we just ate there 30 minutes ago & felt like giving you a hard time & playing a sick joke on your staff (sarcasm).  I'm still very upset about the whole situation, how can you not take your customer's seriously?  Maybe an appology to the both of us?  I don't think I'll ever recommend this place to anyone.  If you screwed up once, you're out with me.

Besides the Tropicana has pizza that will knock your socks off. It's really cheap to eat if you're a local, 1.50 a slice.   But we can dine at anywhere for half off, plus their calzones are out of this world at their cafe.called to order a pizza for pick up, now we had never ordered from them so we didn't know the menu when we asked for a regular pizza we were asked if we wanted thin crust or regular. we specifically said no thin crust. when my father picked up this pizza and brought it back it was a joke. they gave us thin crust cut in little pieces that was burnt.  I called and spoke to who i think was the owner and he is just clueless,  he tells me their regular pizzas are thin crust so I asked him why he didn't tell us that when we did say no thin crust. he had no answer.  he did say that is how we make pizza in Chicago.  well from this New yorker I say you can keep that pizza in Chicago. it was nasty. had to send my dad back for a refund. and I can say we will never order from them again.Horrible! I was craving a chili dog and noticed on yelp that this place was around the corner from my house and was supposed to be famous for their chili so I hopped in the car and ordered the chili dog combo with chili cheese fries. I will say the young man working there was very nice but when I got home I noticed my fries were devoid of chili which I would later be happy about. I opened up the chili dog and took a bite and promptly threw it in the garbage. The "famous" chili tasted like unseasoned squished beans and had the texture of tooth paste. The only edible thing was my fries and the little peppers they threw in the bag. Save your money because this place makes weinerschnitzel look like fine dining.The "STORE" needs some SERIOUS "overhauling" !!! Self check out employees are rude and lazy.I love bbq and had been waiting a while to go this place, because I wasn't sure if it was a good restaurant or not. So I decided to visit recently and ordered a lunch dish with baby back ribs, chicken, and beef, with a side of mashed potatoes. My mother could make better ribs with more meat on them than what I had received at this restaurant. The sauces were disgusting and the waiter didn't even bother to give us biscuits even though they were complimentary. I tried the chicken, but it wasn't anything as expected and was definitely not up to par, this being a bbq restaurant. I didn't even try the beef and for three people we ended up paying around $65 with the tip for a very unsatisfied lunch and setting. I will not come back to this place of establishment.New ownership doesn't get it .Food not good, water was taken from the toilet i think, and service was only so so.  Just another fancy name, with fancy atmosphere, but they forgot to serve food that is edible.  And though you can order a variety of drinks, sometimes washing food down with a glass of water is nice. any restaurant that can't invest in a simple RO system for drinking water or to make their drinks with, shouldn't be charging $12 for an appetizer.  Small price to pay for a comfort that goes a long way.It saddens me to revise my review. I used to like fresh & easy. Under new ownership things went completely negative. Prices are higher, and 3, 5, 10 dollars off coupons are gone. The rearrangement is for the worst also. I don't see a value nor do I like the new set up. I haven't gone in monthsMy family and I eat there at least once or twice a month just to get that at home "Hawaii Nei" vibe. This time I was a bit taken back as there was a hearing impaired homeless woman who wrote a note that stated " please help me I'm hungry, all I need is a bit of food, I'm hearing impaired" I instantly got up off of my table and walked the woman to the front of the cashier and asked her to get the woman what ever she wanted to eat on me. The cashier and another woman paused and then called the cops on the woman. They explained that she has been there before asking for food and sometimes money and then the owner came over and stated that she is not welcome in his restaurant. The cashier proceeded to then help the person behind me and disregarded my request to order and pay for this woman's food. I stood there mostly in shock as I was a paying customer who wanted to show this elderly, hearing impaired woman some ALOHA! I will never take my Ohana there ever again. Sadly there are privileged people in this world who no longer know the meaning of human kindness even when there is a plethora of food amongst them. All she wanted was some food. I'm still smh!I love the shoes! I hated the store in The Palazzo. Since I was staying at the hotel, I went back twice to give the salespeople a chance, first time late at night and the second during early afternoon. I was never greeted by both shifts, not once. And both times I was wearing my Very Prive. I'm never giving this store the commission they will make and rather shop at high end retail stores like Nordstrom, Saks, or Neiman or directly at the Louboutin at Southcoast Plaza in California.I have Multiple Sclerosis, I can walk somewhat. However I can't walk well enough to make it through a Walmart. This one does not have any courtesy carts, they don't own any.... unlike every other mid to large store in the country. Which is not really surprising since this store is so run down and dirty, you can just see no one cares or cleans anything. I'm pretty happy I can't physically shop there and had to leave.I've always come to yelp to read helpful no-hold-barred reviews but this is the first time I've been moved to write one of my own because no one should waste their time and money at this "fine dining" restaurant. 
Before we sat at our table we had a nice glass of prosecco at the bar with a very affable bartender - it looked like we were in for a great night...until we got seated with a server who was part used car salesman part annoying high school substitute teacher.  This guy proceeded to go through and lecture us on the menu for literally 10 minutes...we can read guy and we get it you want us to order the most expensive steak you offer.  This server (I use this term very loosely because we didn't get his name) proceeded to tell us that we shouldn't consider the filet or the fish dishes (really, Batali puts items on his menu that aren't good?) and that the sides aren't like Ruth Chris "you can't just order them" - what does that even mean?  So after mentioning that they keep many of the items in Italian to encourage "a dialogue" we knew that this was one strange place.  
The night before my vegetarian friend suggested I get the buccatini without the pork and she recommended I get the small size, which is literally enough for one person but I should have been tipped off when they said they'll try and push the big size.  OK I'm a vegetarian and even though I'm going to a place called Meat & Wine I'm allowed to be there and eat what I like.  So after asking for the buccatini sans pork he looked and me and said he wouldn't do it..."if we start taking things out of our dishes it'll just get strange and I don't want to put a plate of strange in front of you."  I'll be the judge of strange buddy and don't bs me because my friend ordered it last night.  HE WOULDN'T TAKE MY ORDER AND SAID "I'LL COME BACK TO YOU!"  What happened to the "dialogue" he promised earlier?  Needless to say he hassled everyone of my friends about our orders saying zingers like "that's just 5 bites and won't be enough" "you have to get all of your orders in now because it'll just get awkward if you want more food later."  After we ordered we all decided to leave because we were made to feel so uncomfortable - these servers must be working on commission. 
I spoke to the matre'd on the way out who to his credit was very apologetic and flabbergasted the waiter wouldn't adhere to my vegetarian request.  He offered to seat us in another section - we just wanted to get out of this boiler room so he paid for our drinks.  If this restaurant wants to survive they need to chill out on the hard sell and let people order sizes and portions they feel comfortable with - even though I wasn't getting a steak for 2 I would have drank for two!Last meal with Mario  We went to Carnevino for our last dinner in Vegas. After reading many reviews and being a huge fan of Mario's we were anticipating a delicious meal accompanied by an equally beautiful glass of vino. Upon arrival we were seated promptly. Our waiter was attentive and helpful with the menu.  The music was VERY loud (and I enjoy a restaurant with music and a lively vibe) but we literally had to yell at one another- but what made it worse was the music itself - it was heavy metal with copius amounts of screeching and truly made eating there unnerving. When we asked if they could change the music or turn it down the manager said the playlist is dictated from Mario himself and if he changed it or turned it down he could be fired.  Clearly Mario has an interesting bend to his music but forcing it onto his patrons in a way that just makes you want to get up and run rather than stay and enjoy the food seems like a poor choice.  
As for the food - the garlic butter tastes like hand lotion, my husbands venison came to the table raw and they cleared our wine glasses before the entrees were served   We had to ask for someone to find our waiter so we could get another drink.  When they brought the venison back after its 2nd trip to the kitchen it was over cooked and tasted like a wallet. 
Sorry Mario we will not patronize any of your restaurants again.One of the worst experiences ever...This is not a real restaurant!  They use a microwave and a toaster.  Do not...I repeat do not eat here for breakfast.  They use artificial eggs that are disgusting, stale bread to make toast a and day old potatoes and dry old bacon.  Even the waitress agreed and took the food off of the bill.  Go any where else to get food!  Seriously!This place is a freaking joke!

My dog had an abscess tooth root and his face was swollen up. 

I brought him in and he was misdiagnosed with a bug bite and given some antibiotics to get rid of the swelling: $200. 

A year later it came back big time and was infected! They lanced it and gave me medicine until he could get an extraction:  $200

Brought him in for the extraction which cost $600 and they pulled a tooth on the wrong side of his mouth!! 

When I contacted them they wanted me to pay to have them remove the correct tooth!! Finally after not backing down they decided to do my the "courtesy" of extracting the correct tooth free of charge but refused to refund any of the now $1000 I had paid previously for his treatment even though they knew that I had to open a care credit card to pay for the surgery!!

My dog now has two large gaps on either side of his mouth and has trouble eating...

Never! Ever! Ever! Let them near your dog!!I used to like going to Delux but NOT anymore. About 6 months ago, I picked up a couple of salads and a burger to split with my then pregnant wife. She was a few bites in on the chicken salad and bit down on a 1" long aluminum rivet. She was okay thankfully. Having spent a number of years cooking in restaurants, I understand that equipment gets used pretty hard and things can and do break. So, not wanting to make too much of the issue, I politely called Delux and asked to speak with a manager. The manager got on the phone with me and I advised her what had happened. She didn't ask if my wife was okay-nothing. She asked for my phone number and advised that she would give it to the general manager and have him contact me. Well, to this day no one EVER followed up with me!
Fast forward to last Friday night. My wife wanted a chicken salad and fries so I decided to go to Delux since it is just a couple blocks from my office. I call and am placed on hold for about 5 minutes. I hung up and called a second time and this time waited for almost 10 minutes. I called back one last time before giving up and I get one of the counter girls who takes to-go orders. I start to place my order and "click" she hangs up on me!!! I'm steaming at this point!! Then, I hear the counter girls voice again and she is laughing and talking to someone in the background and says, "man, is that dude going to be pissed!" and then proceeds to hang up the phone!!
So, I decide that I am going to walk in and talk to the manager and let him know what just happened. It turns out that he is no better!! I explained what happened and my frustration with the situation and he just looked at me with a blank stare like, "what do you want me to do about it?"
Its amazing that a place which used to be so good and deliver great customer service has turned to just another local disaster!! If you're wise, you'll avoid these guys like the plague!!Are you kidding me?  

CRUNCHY pancakes. Horridly slow service.  Terrible coffee. Reconstituted powered eggs.  Extremely over-priced... Will never come back here. Do yourself a favor and just get a muffin from the Starbucks on property for breakfast.

I'd give this place zero stars if I could!  It was probably the lowest point of the whole weekend.Not worth the money, I have made better pasta myself. We went last night and 3 of the 4 of us didn't like the food whatsoever, the other person wouldn't pay that price again for the small amount they received.I am an owner at the Grandview at Las Vegas and booked a 2 weeks. I'm in the second week of my vacation and have noticed a lot if little negative things that when added together makes for a really unpleasant stay; like, the guys hanging out, smoking, and creating an intimidating presence for other owners entering at the main entrance of the Daisy building. In the weight room some of the gym equipment is broken. 

The thing that really did it this evening right before midnight on June 2, 2014 I received a call from the operator Natasha stating very rudely that my neighbors complained that I was using the jacuzzi in my room and that security was waiting outside my door. The thing about it is in the week and a half that I've been staying in my room I HAVE NOT ONCE USED THE JACUZZI; in fact I had just returned to my room and was laying in the bed about to fall asleep. I told the operator Natasha this and she stated "there is a security guard waiting outside your door." I got out of bed and opened the door to find a security officer waiting to tell me that I needed to stop using the Jacuzzi because it was after 10pm and was disturbing the neighbors. I Told him I was not using the Jacuzzi and invited him in to come and look at the unused jacuzzi. He told me that he could not enter my unit and I needed to stop using the Jacuzzi immediately.  I then requested to speak to a manager in charge and I indeed received a call from Patrick who went on to tell me the same story and and kept accusing me of using the jacuzzi. The call became a screaming match with me telling Patrick that this was unacceptable an he Patrick screaming at me and cutting me off by screaming that my neighbors are the ones who complained. Patrick's screaming was so loud I had to hold the phone receiver away from my head; I just hung up the phone. All I can say is WOW! What unprofessional behavior.Horrible, horrible, service.
I went to Bar Louie's in Westgate, (Glendale), AZ and put my name down for a table for two.  The hostesses told us the wait would be about 20 minutes.  After our 25 minute wait, our pager buzzed, we went to the hostess booth, and they told us that "they just told them they just started open seating, so we could look around and find an open table."  I looked around the restaurant and every table was taken.  I was so pissed I just said goodbye and went to a decent restaurant.  I couldn't believe that A) the hostesses were too lazy to look themselves around the restaurant for an open table for us -- which is their JOB that they actually get PAID for and B) they were basically telling us to f**k off.Came here for brunch on Sunday around noon, the place was pretty packed, even the patio was full. Two of us waited for about 15mins and was seated in a table next  to the bar. Decor was pretty nice, kinda mixed in the middle of antique and contemporary ...it's DC ranch, right?

Since the place was so busy, I didn't expect the service to be so quick, and I was right, our drinks (coffee and iced tea) didn't come after 15 mins. Our entree orders were Breakfast Steak and eggs and Smoked Salmon hash...both dishes have eggs. After 20 mins of waiting, nothing showed up, and I had to stop our very busy waiter for a refill of iced tea, and another 5 mins later, he showed up saying "we ran out of eggs and we had to get some more, your food will be here shortly" Serious?? it's about 1pm, and you already ran out of eggs??..OMG...besides waiting longer, what I can do??

Our food finally arrived after another 15mins, presentations were nice, my friend's steak dish was pretty good, meat was pretty tender..my salmon dish on the other hand was just so so,, the salmon was too salty and the hash were very dry and not so warm.. I guess the dish was just sitting there waiting for the eggs??..

So our overall experience wasn't so good with the egg situation, services wasn't  attentive, either.. I don't know when will be my next visit...Had the seafood butcher cut up a fish head for me at 7:50pm. Got home, realized he sold me fish that was already going bad...  Returned it and the customer service lady said it was the hot summer weather that caused a bunch of the fish to go bad and smell. If she knew that and if the guy in the back could smell the fish, i have no idea why they were still selling it...  I didn't want to get into an argument but I was going to tell her "the temperature on the outside of the refrigerator has no relation to the temperature inside of the fridge."Came here based on the other reviews from Yelp, but guess what?  It's closed.  Out of business.  Shut its doors.  Stupid recession.  No federal bailout money for small-time Musubi restaurants.I have been going to Bollywood for a few years now and have never had any of the problems that I have read until yesterday.  I was finally talked into a whole face threading (after much badgering and basically belittling).  They know I have sensitive skin, I have been there about 30 times.  My face swelled up like a balloon, and I have red bumps all over the area she threaded.  I went back today to see what she could do for me and she said "I have done thousands of threadings and never seen this before.  Put ice on it." Really thanks, but no S**T put ice on it.  The did a great job on my brows previously, only reason for the star.Wow!!!!!  Worst management/customer service in Vegas.  Not sure if they can be prosecuted for deceptive marketing but willing to try.  My buddy and I booked two rooms in July 2014 because we love the balconies (FYI Cosmopolitan  property beautiful balconies).  After we had unpacked and found the balconies locked, we learned all the balconies have been closed for security reasons.  The web site made no mention of this (otherwise we would not of booked it).  There was also no mention of the resort fee of 47% ($28/59.25).  Since we were already unpacked we agreed reluctantly to stay if the resort fee was waived for our 8 day stay.  The manager lied to my face and said she would do that making no apologies for her deceptive marketing.
When we checked out we found 1 day resort fee on one room was waived.  The manager said that was all she agreed to.  Join me in an international boycott of Palms Place and Palms!!!! (also for tourist always ask to have the scam resort fee waived - I have stayed at 10-15 properties and most casinos won't wave it but many will).Meh. I walked in here before going on a run, so I probably looked like a bummed out college kid, but they COMPLETELY ignored me... WTF!? 

Forget this place. I hate being treated like I don't deserve service just because I don't look a certain way.who wants a 9 dollar whopper meal?!  i do!!!Using my last prepaid wash today and won't be back. Slow service, rude cashier AND they are blasting country music while I wait. This place has gone way downhillWe dined last night. When we entered we asked the hostess for a table on the patio by a heat lamp. She said that would be no problem. We get out to the patio and all the heat lamps are bundled together and off. I see her tinker with one and then walk away. A few minutes later our server approached our table and took our drink orders. We mentioned the heat lamps and he said the owner was probably fixing them for us. (We had two kids with us who were freezing). Just as our drinks arrived another table was sat. The hostess/owner came back out to the patio and started to fix the heat lamps by the NEW table. We ordered our food and said if we could not get a heat lamp we would like to move inside. For the next 15 minutes the owner set up and got working two heat lamps for the new table. Once our food arrived she came over and started on ours. I felt like a second rate citizen. We mentioned that it was cold and she said it was because we were drinking margarita's. I said the kids were not drinking margaritas and their hands were freezing she said they should have gotten up and warmed them by the fire pit. With this kind of hospitality from the OWNER I won't need to ever dine here again.Horrible service this evening ... Walked in at 7 pm ... We occupied only table in restaurant ... Sat for 20 minutes while they took new take out orders ignoring us even though we told them we were ready to order ... Finally walked outI had a coupon for another place that apparently closed, so we wound up here.  Oops.  We thought other names for the place might be:  China Minimum.  China Don't.  China Ridden Hard And Put Away Wet.

The service was nice enough but nothing else was.  The lipstick on the spoon that came with my daughter's egg drop soup pretty much set the tone.  The veggie chow fun and the veggie fried rice were sub-unremarkable.  The baby corn was overly large (we called it toddler corn) and had a musty flavor.  Ug.  The chow fun tasted mostly of soy sauce.  The veggie fried rice was OK.  Oh, we started with crab puffs.  They were overly oily and had no crab flavor.

Just call it China Don't and leave it at that.I gave this restaurant a rating of three stars in June 2009, which was really too high then. I am only disappointed today that there is no Yelp rating below one star. My wife and I have officially scratched this poorly managed restaurant off our regular list of restaurants. Since we eat out 7 nights weekly, we know good food and good service when we see it. A short time ago Lis Doon Varna tried to int ice early diners with a half off appetizer for early diners around 5pm. We went in last week and asked for the half off deal at around 5pm and our waitress told us the new policy was that we had to buy two alcoholic beverages to get the half off deal. Being a regular, with a history of good and poor experiences, I contacted management by email to give them a chance to correct this poorly thought out discriminatory policy but they choose not to respond back. On too many occasions, we have noticed that this restaurant is just poorly managed with little regard to the people who pay the bills. They have gotten our last dollar.i will destroy you the way you destroyed my stomach the other night. i"m not even going to do it myself. i"m going to get the wallflowers to play bowie covers in your parking lot to get you to all come outside and then mothra will take care of the rest.  your overnight crew is losing at life in all the worst ways. i abominate this place.This place is always out of somthing. the Dunkin Donuts on the east coast are 100% betterIf I could go negative, I would and I am usually a big fan of Applebee's! Had the same experience with the gift card fiasco as someone else reviewing and it didn't impress me.  
Called in car side yesterday and showed up at time they said.  Sat in my car with another customer beside me for over 5 mins, no one came out. I called the store and they sent someone out to get my name and order!! Um, didn't you get all that PLUS make n color when I ordered?!? He had to then go back in to get it.  I was livid by now so I just gave him the cash and drove off.  Never again will I go to this one.  I will drive outta my way next time...Curious as to why they name their restaurant Arrowhead "Grill" when they broil there meat...not a fan.  I have no problem paying a lot for a good meal that has great flavor and is palate pleasing.  This food reminded me of what you would get in a cafeteria.
Hostess was snotty, wait staff were nice, restaurant was quite loud.Don't waste your money, worst show I have ever seen, we walked out.Horrible customer service! My family went for breakfast and we all got cold hashbrowns when complaining to our waitress she offered to reheat them, uh microwaved no thanks. Before we ordered I asked to substitute my fries for fruit which they said no, but the prices are the same on the menu. We got the bill and asked to speak with a manager about our cold food, she then proceeded to argue with us that our food was not cold, finally storming away. Are you kidding me. Cold food, terrible service, pick a different place.I have eaten at wildflower in flagstaff. It was wonderful. I decided to try this one and it wasn't even like the same restaurant. Worst meal I've had in some time. Bread was under toasted ,bacon fatty ,very little lettuce      Bad experience !!!!!2 burgers, 2 onion rings, 2 drinks = $30?  Why??? Ordered:  1/2 lb chili burger w/grilled onions. 
Not too difficult, right? WRONG!! 
Received: 1/2 lb burger (no grill marks or taste) which looked like those frozen, robot formed burgers you see in the grocery store. BLAND!! A salad dressing sized cup of what they call great chili.  NOT!! Oh, and (2) raw red onion rings on a giant, non-toasted bun. BLAND!! Not so great customer service. The counter person was unsure of what a chili burger was!! I'm going to in&out! C-yaPolynesian night
I enjoyed the made-to-order pene pasta with clams and pesto - pasta is probably available every night. Very hard to figure out the available choices. I also enjoyed some of the whole pig - probably only available on Polynesian night. The kalua pig was good.

The prime rib was tough, dry (even mid-rare), and full of gristle. How can a kitchen ruin prime rib? A lot of items look to be "take from freezer, heat, put out." Mostly, I found myself trying a couple bites before leaving it on the plate in hopes of finding something good.

Ice cream was soft and airy - not smooth and creamy. The pies were almost tasteless. 

People behind the buffet counter looked exhausted and completely unhappy to be there. While not busy (first clue at 7:30 on Saturday night), I waited 30 - 120 seconds before getting the attention from a worker at the pasta and prime rib stations.

$55 for two with tip, so very expensive for what you get.Ok I'm biased I love Houstons.  But I'm spoiled, it's season and I didn't want to wait for a table so we walked over to j alexanders, it like Houstons right.?  It's good we heard right?
WRONG!
wait the bread was ok.
The salad had boxed croutons.  The french dip was paltry and had little meat on it.  The new York with crumbled blue cheese was the most overdone medium rare I have ever had and the Mac and cheese was just ok.  
Once again the help was below par, not sure if he was new or just nervous.  I'll wait the 30 min at Houstons next time or go to Pomo.I wasn't sure how to respond to the owner's response on Yelp so I am posting this as an update to my original review.  I did try and take a photo with my Iphone when I got home but had trouble centering the photo to show the disparity and gave up.  I am sure you are a very talented waxer as evidenced by the numerous positive reviews.  I suspect you trying to juggle me and two other clients at the end of the day played a big role in what happened with my brows.  I don't really understand your statement about half my eyebrow being gone.  To clarify, the distance between the bridge and one brow is 1/8 and on the other side 1/2.  The hole is not huge but was not there before and the hairs were probably caught in the wax.  I did tell you they looked great, and with the quick glance I had in the mirror I saw clean and shiny brows that looked neat so I was out the door.  It was upon further examination when I got home that I saw how off they were.  I have been having my brows waxed for years and while they definitely were in need of cleaning up, their shape was good and there were no holes.  I truly believe based on the amount time you spent with me, this was a result of you being rushed.  I appreciate very much you taking the time to respond and I hope you will consider slowing down because rushing can lead to mistakes.  I see that you are considered one of the best and that is the only conclusion I can come to for why this happened.Ok, I've tried this place twice and I'm not going back.  The food is.... food.  Maybe I'm just not the person for this place.Your food service sucks and. Your personal can't do anything to. Help me.....  Really....   Wow..I really debated on writing this since I love the one in San Diego (plus a family friend has a large stake in that one), but after the crazy amount of stuff that happened, I have to.

To begin, my wife and I ordered a half yard because my wife has never been here and I wanted her to experience a staple of why people come here. She wanted a sample of the Four Peaks Peach before ordering a full half yard and spending $16 bucks on it (shes not a beer drinker).......guess what? The whole half yard came out instead (The waitress acknowledged this but did not do anything about it). So, my wife was stuck with it.

Next, while we were waiting for our food (over an hour just to let you know), my wife took our 4 month old for a walk outside. When she returned, a passing waitress dropped a glass on wife wifes foot (open toed shoes) and right next to our baby, which shattered everywhere. It was cleaned up quickly but under our table was missed (thankfully a nice bystander customer alerted us to all the glass that was there). A manager never came by once to see if everything was okay (a 4-month old and my wifes foot, and you don't care?)

Food finally arrives and is decent for the most part except for my kids fish sticks. They were cold and tasted horrible. Instead of being white flaky fish inside, it was riddled with black all over (what was this lol, nasty).

Be ready to wait 20-30 minutes in between each time the server stops by.

My wife asked to speak with a manager on the way out...........10 minutes later no one showed. We walked. Ruined the chances of me ever coming back to this Yard House (San Diego is safe!).

My advice, go somewhere that customers are appreciated and your concerns are taken seriously.OMG I'm gonna be sick!

Yeah... True, it's a kitchen, but not so sure on the "food" part.  The food was EXTREMELY bland and without flavor and in smallish portions.  Nothing that we had at our table was ever worth going back for.  This was a few months ago when we went, but we won't be going back!The room is actually OK. I got to stay there one night with very cheap price. I stayed here about 2 years ago. The reason why I came up and give one star is their marketing calls!! They've been trying to call me and sell me the deal or time share package for the last 6 months. Luckily I gave them my Google Voice number. I can block callers and report as spam so I will not receive any call from this number in the future. But they got smarter!! changed phone numbers 4 times. So if you want to stay at this place, make sure you give out fake phone number. Otherwise, you'll end up like these people here: http://800notes.com/Phone.aspx/1-407-517-4913#p470948844093543298Horrible horrible experience. We went to this restaurant specifically due to their allergy friendly menu options and rating. We announced the food allergy and she very clearly understood it when we ordered but the waitress ignored the food allergy, served us food that made one member of our party exceedingly sick, spent the night in the hospital and ruined the entire next day, our only full day in Phoenix! The manager was very nice in person but asked me to follow-up then never returned a call. I just made call number FOUR and neither Bryan Adams nor partial owner Brian Raab have responded! So disappointed. To boot, they billed us for the dinner! HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE.  Lastly, we had reserved a 845 table, were told when we arrived it wouldn't be until 915pm but then they magically got us in 2 minutes after we had drinks in hand from the bar.One word:
HORRIBLE!
The food was lukewarm and not very appetizing. The only thing decent that was served was the chips and salsa....when it finally arrived at the table.
I tried to do a take-out order on their Chicken Tortilla soup, but was told that they don't have carry-out containers??! I wouldn't be surprised if this place closed in the near future.We were at Lee Lee's market and decided to get boba drinks. I ordered passionfruit to try something different. The flavor was very artificial and the drink was very watery. I went back to get a different drink and the girl at the counter tried to charge me for another drink. I asked why they would not just replace the drink with a different flavor and she responded with a smirk that it was my fault because I ordered it. That is extremely poor customer service. I am bummed about this experience, because we have always gone to this place for boba and had never experienced this kind of treatment before. I think the girl was the owner's daughter. As I was being refused, the owner walked behind her, grinned, did not do a thing. Businesses do not succeed with this type of behavior.Yuck! It is overpriced. I ordered the sea bass and butterfish and soft shell crabs. The tempura was bad, and the fish way to oily and buttery. Luckily, we used a groupon but still for three of us we didn't eat much and the bill was way to high. For what you get not worth it. The best part of my meal was the hot tea. Not worth it.The only reasons I'm giving this one star are because it's mandatory and because the bathrooms were very clean with very little wait time. They definitely over sold the show I attended by about 200-300 people. There was no room anywhere to move around, let alone try to dance (which I thought was the point of a nightclub?). They allow smoking inside so all night I was breathing into my arm. They tell you you HAVE to dress in club attire or you may not be allowed in and yet I saw many people in jeans, t-shirts and sneakers. I was about to pass out, because I couldn't breath very well, when I found a small ledge to sit on where other people were also sitting. About five minutes later a bouncer told us all to get down and clear the walkway (what walkway? there was people standing EVERYWHERE). Around 20 minutes after that, there were a bunch of girls sitting in that same exact spot and by the time I left (close to 2:30am because we did not want to stay til closing in those conditions) those girls had still been sitting there the entire time. All I know is, I will never pay that ridiculous amount of money to go stand in the bathroom hallway and sort of hear the music again!I'd give Botero zero stars if I could.  Astoundingly poor service, with astoundingly outrageously priced food.  We were teased with the daily special of Dover Sole only to find it was $75.00 per plate!!!!!  Of course only after we ordered it.  
Insane in today's economy with a half-empty restaurant.  We told the manager it was UNETHICAL and it was.  So mediocre - so disappointing.  In our party of six not one person was satisfied with their meal.  Go to the Mandarin its worth the price.Terrible service for a late lunch with the hubby... Order was wrong.  Thai peanut wings were bomb.  Tried callin in an order on a Saturday night and was placed on hold for almost 10 minutes!  All I wanted was the Thai peanut wings . Busy or not... Service sucks!!!1 out of 5 dishes I ordered was decent.  The rest were horrible.  The one dish was the seabass.  The texture was great, but it was a little bland.  I would not recommend this restaurant.  The resort itself, Encore, is very nice and I enjoy staying there.I've never left a review on yelp, but felt like I had to after this experience. I used this Petsmart Grooming back in December. My dog came home with a red irritated butt where they had shaved her. By the next day there were little bumps all over and they increased in number and ugliness over that day. I called them to tell them I was taking her to my vet and they said bring her to Banfield and they'd take a look. They admitted no fault except that maybe the clippers irritated her skin and gave me an antibiotic and ointment. Months have gone by and I've made numerous trips to my vet and tried 3 different antibiotics. I don't know what was on those clippers or how/if they clean them, but clearly something caused an infection that antibiotics are not killing. My vet is now taking cultures and testing for mhrsa. After this ordeal I would never recommend Petsmart grooming.Ugh.  Where do I start?

I stayed at the Tropicana on a quick weekend trip to Vegas for a convention that was next door at the MGM Grand.  The Grand wanted $300 a night thanks to a Def Leppard concert going on that weekend but the dear, sweet Tropicana was selling rooms for a mere $85 a night.  What a deal I thought, only to find out the old adage "you get what you pay for" is true.

I wanted to like the Tropicana for pure nostalgia reasons.  The hotel is one of the last Vegas originals still hanging on and was a prime spot back in the Sinatra days so when I got to my room in the Island Tower I tried to close my eyes and pretend like I didn't see the white stains all over the couch and desk chair.  Or the brown stains on the sofa.  Or the bamboo styled bed that had a mirror going up the wall and over the bed.  Truth be told my room had a smell that I couldn't place.  The entire experience was a mysterious adventure with suspect results.

To get to the Island Tower you have to walk down a very long corridor with many vendors selling cheap knock offs of mostly glitter tops and light up buttons, cheap jewelry and hair extensions.  They have a buffet that serves fatty prime rib and french toast; luckily it is all you can eat.

The Tropicana is located at the end of the strip near MGM Grand, New York, New York and Mandalay Bay.  You should stay here for cheap cost and location.  Expect nothing from the casino and hold your nose.Stayed here May 1st and 2nd. Could not have encountered worse staff. The whole experience started with a traffic jam in the drop-off area where their Tropicana limo was behind me and started honking rudely at me when I had no place else to go, cars stopped on all sides. RUDE

My Mom was supposed to be a VIP through some promotion. Boy, was that a joke. The guy who checked us in complained about being stuck working there and having to wear a tie when he was more of an outdoorsman. Who cares?! Then he told us the bellhops would come get out luggage from self park but the bell desk said nope, gotta drive up to the front AGAIN. Then it took the bellhop over 20 minutes to get our luggage up to our room. They weren't even busy!

The absolute most outrageous encounter was when I went to get a players card and the agent took my license, entered everything in, and then got upset when I told him the address was incorrect. He proceeded to chastise me and give me a "talkin to" on why I should have thought to mention that to him BEFORE he started typing. What?!

Then we went to play slots, were in the same area for over an hour, no cocktail waitress. I got up and walked around. Could not find a single one! I went to the bar and the bartender said they had all called in sick. He made me my drinks and charged me $6 each!

The pool is nice but the music is out of control loud. They were probably trying to cover the sound of construction on their soon to open "Nikki Beach" beach club.

The buffet is a total rip-off. For $18 we got about as many choices as you get at a small grocery deli. Food quality was mediocre and the guys who worked there refilling the dishes were pushy and RUDE.

Would NEVER go back.Tropicana, you BLEW me away....Instead of renovating, this place should've been sold and torn down.

Upon check in there was only 2 front desk employees checking guest in.  The line was long Disneyland long.

Got into our room, and the room smelled like a sweaty dog, I turn up the A.C to try and blow the smell away. I then begin changing for our reservations, took off my shoes and notices that my socks were immediately soaked! The carpet was just cleaned, awesome!! NOT!!!! felt like I standing in a puddle. 

I then called the front desk, she offered me a downgraded room, without a downgraded price, and sends up blower to dry the carpets..
 
A nice lady said Sorry, placed the loud machine in the room and left. At this point I just begin laugh. As we wait and wait and wait longer for someone to take us to our new room, our time for the reservations come up and we gotta go!!! As we were leaving an employee came up to move us rooms, 45 minutes too late buddy!  At this point I chalked it up as a loss and remained in the "upgraded" room I paid for a.k.a Swampland. 

As the weekend continued, I left the blower in and moved it around the room to make sure the carpets were dry for the next guest.. You're welcome Tropicana!!!

I'm sure with as much money I lost gambling, I could've paid to get the 10th floor of the paradise tower re-carpeted, but hey, at least I got a coupon for a free cookie.

I called to check out, I asked the front desk if they wanted me to bring down their blower I became good friends with, front desk girl chuckled in question,  then  I explained my story for the 3rd time and got a simple "we're sorry." And that was my last chance I gave the Tropicana to redeem themselves. 
 
Best part of the hotel would be the valet, bringing my car back so I can drive away.

With the entire hotel situation still being stuck in my head, and believe me, I'm not much of a complainer, I called back a few days later, just to speak to a manager or Supervisor. I clearly stated that I didn't want my money back or anything for free. I simply wanted them to know of how poorly the situation was handled. The person, MAJID*** (spelling?**) I spoke listened to what I had to say, was very apologetic and said he would spread the word to fix future mishaps.He then offered me a one night stay, that was very nice of him but no thanks.Hyper expensive beer, $10 for a Stella. Dirty booths.  One waitress for the entire "box" wasn't enough to give customers the attention they deserve when you are raping them with high prices.  The wrap was ok, but barely.WOW !  Worst rental car experience of my life. 

Booked a mid sized SUV here and got pressure to upgrade car and insurance coverage.  Guy working there was so slow and tried to get me to add on all kinds of BS I didn't need.  He even gave me the "don't tell my manager I'm giving you such a good deal" routine - REALLY!

Literally took me 30 minutes to get my paperwork done. I feel like they were trying to scam me - I'll never rent from Dollar again if I can help it.  STAY AWAY!This place is terrible! 

Being a native NYer, I was excited to find a deli labeled "real NY deli". This is the equivalent to a super shitty, dirty Bronx bodega or road-side "deli" in some po-dunk upstate NY town. This is no "NY deli".

The meats were over processed crap, bathroom was among the dirtiest I've ever seen any where in the world. On the positive, the people seemed nice & it's cheap. Totally disappointed.Live within walking distance so we thought we would try happy hour.... Could have a had a better thought.  The bartender spent the entire time chatting with an old co worker about some girl and things that can't be repeated on here.  We ordered a $15 split on which he served warm ( bar back told him it was warm) he told his co worker to spin in ice a couple times.  When I said it was warm he acted surprised and added ice to my glass.  After being told several times we were going to order food and more drinks he never asked us if we needed anything because he was too busy talking to old friend.  Saw other customers trying to get service but no go.  Unfortunately we had to disrupt his conversation to ask for our check... Went to Kona to eat and drink.   Never assume.When service is this bad, who even wants to try the food?! Went here last night with my wife and six other people. When we arrived the hostess actually appeared unhappy to see us. The place was a ghost town except for one family and a couple but we were still told it would be a 10 minute wait. After waiting 15 minutes and receiving no updates from the surly blonde in front, we decided to go spend our usual $200 plus tip someplace where they would be happy for the business.Okay... Let's be honest here for a moment...

I have stayed at 6 or 7 places in Vegas, from the 5 star megaresorts tot the $29 a night.  I usually like my stays, usually because I get what I pay for.  I don't check into the South Point, a decent place but not really nice, expecting the Wynn or Encore.  I am okay with that because I get the room for $35 along with some decent card playing.

I stayed here with friends this weekend and we paid a premium price because we wanted a premium experience.  Unlike the slightly less expensive Wynn, of which I have had two very good experiences, this was awful.

First, the entire place is dark.  Very dark.  The dark wood and metal design is paired with horrible lighting.  I felt like I was staying at the mole casino the entire time.

Next, everything was very spendy.   I expect spendy on the Strip, but at no point do I feel like the money was returned to me in value.  The room was small... Very small... And many of the fixtures, paneling,  and compliments were of cheap or poor quality.  It felt like the room was put together in a rushed way and there were several minor flaws.

The service was horrible.  I would assume that this far after opening, the hotel would have worked out it's kinks.  I get that it is tough to create an experience for guests but at this point, a premium hotel needs to have their ducks in a row.  The front desk made promises at checkin that were made good, uniformed staff ranged from rude to sullen and checkout didn't work at all, let alone the horribly disorganized way they store and retrieve bags.

This would be a four or five star place if I had paid a price similar to the Luxor or Mandalay Bay or Treasure Island or New York New York, but for good money, Ii expect better, period.

Next time, i will accept nothing less than the Wynn.I have to say...when this restaurant first opened, I was thrilled because it was close to my house and the owners were Soo charming :) the food was freshly made and delicious!! But, within the past few months since the restaurant got new owners, the food has changed :/ while they kept the menu the same, there is a big change in taste. The new owners seem nice, but I just don't like the new food. I used to recommend this place to all my family and friends, but now its just not the same :/I used to eat there quite often until I needed knee surgery a year ago.  I was so excited to start to go back there this evening....it was Horrible...dangerously Horrible...not even close to resembling the wonderful Cajun restaurant I remembered...this was tastless, cold food that took 1 hour to be served and there were only 4 tables of customers.  The waitress knew we were not happy but we were not rude...but did a manager come over to see if we were happy or what he could do....BIG NO!!!!   I am calling the health dept tomorrow.Could not believe how far downhill The Cheesecake Factory has gone downhill!  Four of us went and our meals were terrible!  Clearly not as I remembered from other The Cheesecake Factory restaurants.  Would I go back? NOT!I am highly disappointed.

I heard this buffet was excellent, not only from yelp, but from my friends. So I was very excited to try the buffet while waiting in line for an hour and a half during Christmas dinner. 

The buffet is 40$ on Friday-Sunday and holidays because of added seafood, other days are around 24$.

I will quickly highlight points to save all you curious people time.

A lot of the food were SALTY: lambs, orange chicken, fish.

Salmon was dried, sushi so plain, crab meat very empty, oyster was not fresh.

The service was terrible, the waitress mixed my party drinks with another party.

I honestly feel like the restaurant is having an issue with their main chefs because there's a reason why they have 4 stars ratings from before.

I will not come back, until I know 100% the quality of the food will be better. I recommend Rio Carnival Buffet. The 1-star is for upsetting my whole party.I went to Tandoori Times today for lunch with six of my co-workers for lunch. It was not the best Indian food I've had, but it was definitely not the worst (I had the achari lamb lunch special). But my experience there was horrible.

My issue with Tandoori Times was the service. Our waitress did not seem to care about our table at all, even though we were the largest party in the place. Maybe she felt that she did not need to work for her tip since it was automatically added to our bill. 

She never checked on us to see if we needed anything. One of our party members even had to chase her down just find out where his food was after everyone else's food had shown up 10 minutes before.

She had issues with our check and stiffed us on our change. I bill was $97. Three people put in $20, another a $10, and three people asked her to charge $17 a piece on their credit cards. That totals $121.00. We asked for change from the cash. SHE CAME BACK WITH NO CHANGE AND WALKED AWAY. As we were already 30 minutes late from lunch and were in a hurry we left, but she swiped a $24.00 tip.

Even though the food was good, the service was the worst I think I've ever had. I will not be returning to this restaurant any time soon.I have never been so disappointed in my life after waiting for 40 minutes , I received my order went home and opened the pizza boxes and BURNT BURNT to a crisp , I called and explained to them that the pizzas are burnt they said to come back and I could get a new one . However I live 10 minuets away and the kids were hungry and couldn't waste any more time to on driving back and waiting another 40 minuets to get pizza , so I told them I wasn't able to come back today then she said she could give me 10% off my next pizza really not coming back NOPE not for a 1.50 off 1 pizza after I sent $40.00 bucks .. 
SO DISAPPOINTEDDon't even try to make a massage appointment here. They cancelled me two Saturdays in a row.This review is based on the frozen hot chocolate.  I first read about it on a 10 things in Vegas you can't miss list, and I found many glowing reviews when I looked into it further.

There is nothing amazing or life changing or delicious about this drink.  It is not cool or inventive or intriguing.  It is a pretty boring slushy that takes like your typical hot chocolate made from a packet.

My tastes are usually discriminating but reasonable, and this drink did nothing for me.  I ate the whipped cream off the top, drank about 1/4 of it, and tossed it.  Eleven bucks well spent.

I am guessing that their regular desserts are fine, but this seems to be some sort of a signature item, and it was a real disappointment.Let me start off by saying that we have come to this location for many years, but this time was our last. The experience here has slowly declined over time. Our previous two visits were an insult to the restaurant business. I, myself, am a server and therefore understand when certain circumstances arise that problems may happen. That being said, our last two visits made me never want to return. 
We had the same server, Jennifer S., both times. Her initial approach to the table took exceedingly long both times ( over 15 minutes). Once we got out drink and appetizer order in the waiting only further continued. Drinks took another 15 minutes to come out (soft drinks) and the appetizers never came out at all. Spoke with the manger, he apologized, and said he would make sure everything went more smoothly.  He could only compensate so much for the lack of abilities from the server. Once our food came out, she, along with anyone else, besides the manager once, never checked on us again for the remainder of our visit. 

We decided to give them another chance today, assuming that maybe it was a fluke. However, once we were seated and again started waiting, we knew there was a reason why we didn't want to come back. We had the same server as last time. This time, she greater us and it only took ten minutes. Drinks and appetizers came out in another ten, but we were without silverware. Our food came out in another half and hour, but we were still without silver because nobody had checked on us since we received our drinks and appetizers. So now, with salads, appetizers, both untouched because of no silverware, we had more food. Silverware came out when it decided it wanted to apparently. After speaking to the manager again, and explaining the events on this occasion and the last, he apologized and we received silverware. Our server came back once more before the end of the meal, and that was to drop off the bill. We had no refills or boxes until right when we were going to walk out. 
This being said, the food here is excellent and has always been.  Our service, and our server, were the worst I have ever experienced. Every time we would ask for something, which surprisingly wasn't that often since she rarely made an appearance at the table, she would say "thank you".  Even when she forgot something, there was no apology, only a "thank you". She obviously doesn't care about returning customers or customer service at all for that matter. She is bringing the restaurant down single handedly. I can, in no way, speak for others who she served, but I did hear other tables around us complaining at the same time. 

We would love to have a reason to come back here, but due to the lack of service quality, follow through from management, and overall poor dining experience, I don't know if I will be returning. 

If you must eat at BJ's restaurants, please choose another location at the very least. You will be disappointed if you cone here expecting a nice experience. "Thank you"We were looking to join a gym recently, but when we showed up to talk to someone and get a tour, they wanted us to fill out these liability release forms and sign them. Why do we have to divulge all of our personal information including our date of birth and sign a liability release form just to get a tour? We walked out. That seemed like a red flag. A sneaky way to get us on some kind of spam mailing list or something. No Thanks! We went straight to LA Fitness and they were happy to give us a tour right when we walked in.Do not go here I went here and ordered the Chipotle Steak sandwich. It is by far the worst sandwich ever it was chew and greasy . I would not come back!I'm not going to address the food I had today at lunch, but rather my experience here...

The folks from work had been raving about this place all week and said that we're going here today for lunch.  There were roughly 12 of us, and they brought the food out to us as it was ready...usually 1-2 lunches at a time.  My lunch was the last one to come out, and when the server set it in front of me, I didn't think it looked right.  I told her that I didn't think that this was what I ordered.  She looked around the table and realized that another person had my lunch.  Even though he had started eating the lunch I ordered, she flat-out said for us to just switch plates and for me to pull off his plate what he had eaten off of mine.  I thought she was joking at first...but, she wasn't.  So, we actually swapped lunches, instead of them bringing me a new and correct lunch.  The other guy only ate a piece or two of sushi off my plate with his chopsticks and didn't touch the other stuff, but I still find this gross and unacceptable to swap lunches.  I really should have gotten up and walked out...needless to say, I will not be returning here.My friends and I ate here while waiting for our flight.  I had some chili fries while everyone else had burgers.  

I'll start with the chili fries.  They're made with waffle fries and beef.  Someone doesn't know what chili is.  The cheese was sparse and there was a smattering of sour cream on top.  All of this came together to form the worst chili fries I've ever eaten.  

The burgers were about as good.  The buns were hard and my friends had to request more which didn't come out much better.  The cheese was congealed and the burgers came with bacon, which they didn't order.  The waiter's response?  "Oh well, at least you don't have to pay for it."

If only we all could have been so lucky.Ordered their house lo mein, the noodle was very soggy. Flavor was so-so, nothing special about it. Also ordered an order of the potstickers, it was very doughy. The soy sauce for dipping was good though. Overall not impressed.Horrible service, mediocre food,$25 credit card minimum. Everytime i come to this place it takes forever for my food to come and they never give me the check when im done. Id have to go up to the front counter to pay. The thing is it was never busy at all! The only great thing about this place is daily lunch specials.I don't recomend this restaurant; poor service, no customer service they don't give you water unless you ask for it, and when about time to pay and were waiting for our change and waiting and waiting they ignore us to give our change until we just left the restaurant. SMHI paid cash up front for furniture here in May of 2010.  By mid July I had not yet received the furniture & when it eventually came at the end of july 2 pieces didn't match & 1 was irreparably scratched.  Not to mention that I never received 2 pieces that were to have come with the set before I showed up & the warehouse was empty. They had up & left.  If I could track them down & file a small claim suit for theft I would.Ohhh man where to even start...

I frequent this plaza quite a bit, Mind Over Batter is located right next to Yupha's Thai and Jeniza Nails (both 5 star establishments in my opinion). I was very excited to see a locally owned cupcake shop had opened here. 

We had some time to kill before a nail appointment at Jeniza's and I was treating my 9 year old goddaughter to a fun girls day for her birthday. Mind Over Batter was super clean and so cute! Hot pink walls with blank and white checkered floors yaaaaay we were both so excited! 

That was until we were greeted by two very grumpy female employees behind the counter. Actually we didn't even get a greeting, just a very blaghh "what can we get for you". I told them that it was out first time in and we needed just a minute to look. When I asked what their most popular flavors were I got a "this, this and, that" with a finger point. They made it very clear that they were not happy we were there. 

When we did order a younger guy helped us. We had planned on getting a half dozen but after pointing to the first cupcake and him responding "THATS IT"? I nearly lost my cool. Ya that was IT with this place. I had him wrap the ONE cupcake to go. He handed me my change and didn't say a single word NO "thanks for coming" NO "have a nice day". The first thing out of my goddaughters mouth when we left was "they were all so RUDE". I mean come on 
for a nine year old to pick up on this when she had a hundred chocolate drizzled cherry topped cupcakes in front of her face is just ridiculous! 

For $3.00+tax PER cupcake you should at least get a smile and thanks. I am really disappoint to have to give a local small business such a bad review. A quality product will completely become over shadowed by bad attitudes and customer service.We stopped here for a late lunch. Authentic looking SW decor, but not very clean, and no service from the start. With nobody greeting the public, we eventually found our own seats. Drinks took 25 minutes though there were only 3 tables. 

Maybe the worst part of this meal, at least visually, was the side of guacamole...it appeared to have cottage cheese mixed in it. We eyed it while waiting another ten minutes for the chips the waiter forgot. I did not eat it, apparently my husband was hungry enough to NOT object to cottage cheese guacamole. By now it seemed destined that I would go home hungry, and yes I did.

When at last the meals arrived mine, was ice cold on a hot plate. I sent it back and it returned to me freshly microwaved. The spicy white cheese sauce with fresh jalepeno on my enchiladas was akin to eating raw flour. Two bites was more than enough and no, they did not offer to take it off our bill. One of the worst meals I've had in a very long time. 

Save your money, eat somewhere else!We used to go all the time, but the food sucked, it was a hole and the only good thing we used to say about it was it was a good place to take a sh....

Now they have let the only cool bartender go because he was a guy. Most of the girls were horrible and not all that to look at. 

Plus they promote the free shuttle, but normally the guy who was suppose to drive it was too drunk to be the driver.

Time to find a new home in Chandler.Okay, I have not given any place a one star review in a while, and looking at some of this restaurant's "friend"ly reviews... I am one of the only few that has given this place a one star.  Why?? Overall feeling.  A big part of liking or loving a restaurant not just about the food or service.  Its the atmosphere and how it makes you feel.  Here....it seems out of place.  
This restaurant is pushing a concept and atmosphere onto downtown phoenix that seems to fit better in Scottsdale.  Here in downtown, we are a bit more down to earth, we like to feel welcomed and comfortable when coming to a restaurant...we don't want to sit upright and nibble on a $5 Chicken wing!  And yes it is is Wing....singular!
With that out of the way...lets move on

Service:  Not ban but not good.  The servers were not helping in describing the dishes.  Especially for a asian fusion restaurant, this is a must
Ambience:  The patio looked great...the decor was kinda weird...I did not get the music nor the art that was displayed.  It did not fit the concept.
Drinks:  I didn't even order...not interesting

Food:  I had the Duck Confit  which I have to say one of the worst I have had.  It was so oily and flavorless.
Spring Roll- how can anyone over soak rice paper?? It was so soggy, I took one bite and that was it
Lop Xeong Crepe- Again another soggy item....urggh
Tonkotsu Ramen- This was not done correctly...the broth is too rich...not in a good way
Dessert-Blueberry Mochi with Lychee sorbet-  Now this was great!!  The textures and sweetness, good balance

All in all, I was really disappointed with this restaurant.  I wish the chef/owner would have stuck to something more similar to his other successful concepts which are more in line with his skills...Asian fusion I don't think is his niche...there are many asian fusion restaurants that have better execution...
The Mission is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix...that should have been a model when opening a new restaurant...that is what downtown phoenix needs.If I could leave negative stars I would. Took over an hour to deliver. When I received my order it was $10 more than the price originally given on the phone. The idiots got both orders wrong, and when I called to speak with the manager he told me he had been in this business a long time and knew more than I did. Really? Well at least now I know not to order from a disgusting and overpriced restaurant (if you could even call it that) with even more disgusting customer service. You'd be better off buying microwave lasagna from Albertsons.I absolutely HATE my hair even more now.

I came in here setting my expectations real, that not all hair stylists will know absolutely what is on your mind as to what you want done in your hair.

But when I show you over and over how I want my hair to look like, even told you that I want long layers, and want my damaged hair to be trimmed..
yet you still managed to effed it up...
then I have no choice but to warn others not to go to this place!

YOU HAD ONE JOB!

My hair right now, is 3 inches shorter and has no shape whatsoever!

Why would it have any? when all you did was to point your scissors down and cut my hair diagonally from my cheek to the tip.

If that is what you call "layering".. then NO THANK YOU.

I have seen more gift-wrapping skills with the scissors than that lady who calls herself  a "stylist".

seriously... don't believe all the high star ratings on this place.
by all means, waste your $40 on this place just to suffer for 2-3 months before you can take your hair again somewhere else.An appointment was set up to have my mom's television mounted this morning. Not only did he never show up, he never answered the phone after not showing up.So i went here one late night freaking starving! So I decided to get something real quick. This carls jr was the first fast food I spotted. And my experience in this particular carls jr drive thru was theee worst service I have experienced in my life! First of all the woman at the drive thru took at least 3minutes to even respond and she got my order wrong twice! I actually had to pull up to the srive thru wondow because she could not get my order correct. Finally she gives me total with a rude tone and slams the window in my face while Im asking very politely if she can repeat my order. And to believe it or not that was only strike one for me! so finally she gets back to the window 5 min later (and I am not stretching the truth at all when I say she took 5 min) literally snatches the money from my hand (strike 2) and again slams the window in my face! Ugh! I was really getting to my very last nerve at this point. So she takes awhile to come back my food and of course she gets my order wrong. (strike 3) she over charged me! And surprisingly I kept my cool. So I drive away and get get home and she totally skimped me on my fries!  I dont know if this lady was out to get me or if someone is trying to test my patience! who knows! Maybe she was having a bad day and decided to take it out on me? But this is THE LAST TIME im ever eating carls jr EVERRR!what the heck!! says delivery at front door at 3.37...um i run a business...front doors were open till 6 pm...no such delivery..this also is a valentines gift..shizz! now what...called them the woman on the phone was nice...told me she was gonna contact the driver to find out what happened..so i sit here and wait...i guess like the rest of you..lolDO NOT GO HERE! Avoid eating here if at all possible. My aunt and I went and the food was not fresh and it definitely wasn't tasty at all. The service sucked and when I attempted to point out a problem to the cashier (who said he was the manager) he didn't take the complaint seriously. They use dark meat chicken instead of white meat, which by the way tastes absolutely NASTY! The only reason this got one star is because their interior is decent. They up the price on weekends and holidays which isn't worth it. Even the normal price of $9 is a lot for a crappy buffet that serves nasty food. I'll certainly never be returning ever again and I encourage you to not go there either. It's not worth even going. I'd rather go eat at Panda Express and I'm not a huge fan of them to begin with, but their food is a lot better than this buffet's.this bakery shop can really kill people.   not sure what's stuff they put in their cookies..it's horrible and make you sick to your stomache.....nasty food, everything is stale and old.  service is horrible too.   i will file a complaint to the better business bureau and might even sue them if my kids don't get better by tomorrow.This is hard to do as I never give one star reviews, but it is hard to review a company that doesn't return phone calls. Don't leave a message saying you will return a phone call after business hours when you have no intention of doing so. I will be taking my business elsewhere.went here for lunch because we're looking for some asian food on the strip, checked yelp, saw this place has 3  star and pretty decent price. BEWARE that's not true. If you're from cali or seattle don't bother coming here.  There were so many wrongs with this place:

food sucks, msg in kalbitang. we had bibimbap, fried rice, kalbi tang, tofu soup and spicy beef soup. not a single one of them impressed us.

price is somewhat expensive. 12.95 for mediocre tofu soup, and 15.95 for bibimbap. 

fried rice has no taste. i don't know if they forgot to add seasoning at all.

the food pic in the menu is totally different. bibimbap pic looks like it has plenty of veggies, the real thing is half the size and not filled with veggie. the fried rice pic is also different, it's like ordering sunny side up and you got scambled egg

banchan is only 4 kinds: cabbage kimchi, anchovy, beansprout and chinese brocolli. the kimchi taste like kimchi that you buy from ranch99 in bulk

when asked for the bill, we had to wait 30 mins

ordered hot tea that costs money and the hot water is not refilled everytime. we had to ask the server for hot water, and she's so stingy with hot water. 

now i learned not to get asian food on the strip. best bet is go for the buffet.These guys at fresh wasabi microwaved my hamaichi Kama - scary!!!! Go to Sushi Brokers in Scottsdale for consistent and fresh sushi. Sorry this place does not cut it for me. Sushi rice was vinegary!was very amped to try this spot after seeing it on Food Network, my expectations were not at all met! i would like to know how they ever got on diner, drive-ins and dives in the first place! i ordered the strawberries and creme waffle and it was a joke. ridiculously small for 9 dollars! also i had to ask for syrup!! what diner serves a waffle with NO syrup?! i also decided to try the fresh lemonade and that was a mistake as well. the mint added to it is overpowering, it tasted like facewash. i changed my lemonade for some fresh OJ, slightly better but not what fresh orange juice should taste like, it was quite bitter. overall i wouldn't go back here even if my friends were paying.the hamburgers are like school lunch hamburgers that have been supersized.  that being said, i think my hamburger might have been the most edible thing on the menu.  my companion's food looked like vomit on a bun.We had to try this place out because one of our favorite Vietnamese restaurant closed early on Sunday so we had to try this place.  We ordered the Pho soups, and we were hoping it would be the same as we were used to; boy oh boy we were wrong. Their Pho soup is not good at all. I had the Chicken Pho soup and it was terrible. My wife ordered the Veggie and Tofu Pho soup and she didn't like it either.  We also ordered the veggie spring rolls. Both were "broken" when got home; they weren't tightly wrapped. We didn't finish our soup nor the rolls, and we can say it was a waste of $20. Definitely NOT coming back to Viet Kitchen.Our waitress was great. But the service was super slow. Probably cause one person was taking table orders and waiting on every table. And 4 people standing up front not doing anything but talking to each other and playing on their phones. The owner needs to start managing this place. Very disappointing for a first visit. Better pizza places right down the streetTook my Mini in for a stalling issue that would not throw a code.  Took 2+ days but they did fix the problem (at great expense).  When I picked up my car, however, they had put 125 miles on it over the course of 2-3 days and damaged the arm rest and hood.  (To be fair, the writer had called on day 2 to ask if they could drive it a little to make sure the fix was good; but 125 miles ?!?!).  They did fix the hood and armrest when I took it back in.  Had to be ignored for 25 minutes first, tho.  Got the usual laundry list of disastrous items that needed immediate attention.  Ordered the parts on line and had my usual mechanic install them for 1/3 the price that the dealership wanted.  Now I wonder if I even needed those repairs.Took my wife for dinner on a Saturday night and ended up walking out after the first bite. The sushi was stale and room temp at best, with the selection limited to tuna and unagi. The food was terrible. I tried the s&s chicken and my wife tried some chicken with mushroom. Immediately after the first bites we looked at eachother and knew we were leaving. I feel bad only leaving a few bucks for the waitress but this place is revolting. How it got 4 stars is beyond me. I've had better chinese made by a french foreign national than this place.Food is terrible . It's like going to a high school back yard kegger party. I will leave this place for the younger can't hold there liquor crowd..I came here to hear a band I had been wanting to see. The music was great, but I can't overlook the beyond terrible service.

Our first round of beer was served in 16 oz plastic cups. For some reason, after this our waitress brought our next round in 12 oz plastic cups. We were ready to have a good time that night and so we requested our drinks be brought in the larger pint size. She shrugged and said she couldn't do that, the smaller plastic cups were all she had. I was okay with that, until I saw her bring the table next to us some beers in 16 oz pint glasses (not plastic!). We then requested the same glass as they had, but she then told us her manager wouldn't let her use glass because they had to wash them - it's a restaurant and bar, OF COURSE there will be dishes to wash! 

After this, we ordered several more rounds, all brought in 12 oz plastic cups while I watched her bring 16 oz glasses to several tables around us. I honestly have no idea why this occurred, but it made me pretty annoyed. 

The food was okay - very fried and greasy but exactly what I would expect from a Hooters.

When the bill came, we were charged a full pint on every 12 oz drink we had (I know, because it clearly said "PINT - STELLA" and whatnot on each line of the receipt). We brought this up to the waitress, who acknowledged they weren't pints, shrugged, and said she couldn't do anything about it and we had to pay full price for each drink. This was one of the only times in my life I have left a tip under 15%, but I couldn't reward that woman's dismissive and rude behavior.This place was horrible! Went in for dinner, place was about half full, if that... Should have been a warning sign... Took more than 20 minutes to get a drink order in. Over 30 minutes to get some chips. Chips came, and the server had dropped off a load of beer for another table at the same time as getting out chips. He had manages to get the run off from the beer all over the chips. Didn't notice it till we were like wonder why the wet!?! Gross! Food came about 45 minutes later, it was nasty... Dry, flavor-less, and my stomach was all messed up after this place. Wonder why... 

Save your money, don't go here. Everything from the food to the service is a joke...This place is a joke.  Every person who works there are greedy, ouch! just pricked myself. Each one EXPECTS to be juiced BEFORE you even walk to pay cover.  You go to a place to enjoy and have fun.  Haze is a serious downer and buzz-kill.  Music was a joke on Thursday night.  Oh and tables, expect $450 which does not sound too bad for Vegas until you actually get to the table.  Then before you sit down, add another $100.  BTW: This is for the CHEAPEST vodka.  Not even close to Ketal or Goose.   Best advice, STEER CLEAR.  PERSONNEL ARE GREEDY ARSES.  Hit Tao or Marquee.  Level headed personnel who know how to treat customers.Amazingly disgusting yet mildly charming. Odors of all sorts, dirt & filth plus sweet sound of pigeons outside my window. Spotted: two coke cans circa 1990s in the gutters. A gem of a place :)There is an old guy in there that is terrible with cuticles and really ssssllloooowww
Very disappointed would NEVER return 
They don't understand  English unless it comes to $$$Just not very good. I told them the po boy didn't taste right and the didn't seem to care.I did not have a good experience here at all! The receptionist, Sharon never called me back when I left a VM, I had to call again. Then she lost my phone # and email. I wanted to change my appt from 2d to 3d and she never did it. When they called to confirm they said it was only 2d.  When we got there the sonographer and receptionist didn't say a word to us for several minutes. I was also told to come 15 mins early for the 3d. Well we ended up sitting in the waiting room those extra 15 mins. 

The sonographer was very cold to us. She didn't introduce herself or ask what my husband or daughters names were. She didn't seem enthused at all. It's supposed to be an exciting time, right? Finding out the sex of your baby is supposed to be one of the most thrilling moments in your life. Not here. 

The whole reason we went with 3d is because it's says online is guaranteed! 2d doesn't say you will guarantee leave knowing the sex, but 3d does. So we debated and decided to pay the extra $25 and do it. What a waste!!!!! She was having a hard time finding the gender on the 2d, so I asked for her to use the 3d so we could know for sure. She said it's better on 2d! What?! Why did we even bother then?! I don't even think she knows what her website says. She also told me some thing about the baby being a certain way on the placenta and how I wouldn't feel movement yet. I feel movement everyday. I asked my doc and she rolled her eyes, saying she has no idea what's she talking about.

We are so excited to know the sex! But other than that, I honestly would never go there again or recommend it to my friends or family. Just wait for the 20 week appoint so you have someone who really cares about you and wants you to be comfortable. Also, someone who knows what they are talking about.I don't even want to give this one star... the staff at the front desk was less than courteous.  the walls in the rooms are cement blocks, makes you feel like you're in prison.. there was candy smeared all over the floors, and popcorn not even vacuumed up.  the dust on top of the TV was so thick I wrote "wash me" on it.  The air conditioning would not stay on... It smelled in there.. DO NOT stay here. Yes, it was cheap, but spend a couple extra bucks and get a real hotel room!I liked Babys, I liked Body English; Vanity I did not. The Hard Rock just missed the mark with this club. Music was not good and had no continuity. The set up was a bit maze like, and on this Saturday night it was not even close to being packed.The one star it did get was for the table set up. Every seat is a good seat.  Could have just been an off weekend, but from this experience, I wouldn't suggest it to anyone.This review is subject to change as I have not actually received my order yet.

I dropped off a sweatshirt with Think to do a very simple one sided print. I was told that the sweatshirt would be ready by the following wednesday, thursday at the latest. Doubly assured it would be done by christmas which was the whole point. 

Well wednesday rolled around and they said it would be ready friday. I was already surprised that it was going to take them a week to do a one off, one sided print, but I'm an amicable customer in general and I didn't hassle them about it. I called them on Friday and after many times trying to reach them, I had to ride my bike over to their location only for them to tell me their phone had been silenced... and that my shirt was at another location, but to rest assured it would be there by 3:30. Very disappointing, but not nearly as disappointing as what followed.

After several correspondence and a second trip back to the store at 3:30 my shirt still was not there. They told me that they were behind on their orders and that they would be staying late to catch up, this would be admirable if it didn't turn out that not only was no one on their way to bring me my order, but it had never even been started in the first place. I find it incredibly hard to believe that NO ONE  on the staff was aware of this during the entire week. The person I spoke to was very apologetic and PROMISED me that he would come in on saturday to get the shirt done, and would call me when it was ready. Now I'm in Northern California a week later with no jacket.

So now I am forced to write this review and share my experience with yelp. I see you guys respond to your bad reviews so here's what I have to say in summary:

1. Be attentive. It helps to actually know where your merchandise is located
2. Be honest. I was misled and brushed off by their entire staff. THE ENTIRE STAFF
3. Acquire the capacity to do your own printing. You're a shop that puts graphics on T-shirts, you should probably be able to do a one off in your own shop.

Perhaps I will be blown away when I get my shirt back and it will all be worth it. I would be willing to re-evaluate this review if that is the case. I will be coming back New Years Eve, and look forward to seeing if the quality of their product matches the quality of their service. I am much more curious though at how they are planning on making this up to me.Horrible customer service experience. I called ahead of time and asked about a coupon I received. When I arrived and at checkout it was a different story. Shady customer business the girl tried to keep coming up with excuses on why she wouldn't take their money mailer coupon then said they charge $5 for trimming down my nails.  The nails themselves are okay, the gel doesn't look great though and has tons of bubbles. Either way we won't be back, I think there are better quality businesses in the local area to support then their lack of business ethics here. Avoid them at all costs, go elsewhere!!!If it was possible to give zero stars for this establishment, I would.  DO NOT rent from these people.  I regret it!  Pay the few extra dollars for a reputable company.

First of all, the man that helped me at the counter was unfriendly and rude.  Whatever.  I can get past.  What I can't get past is the fact that my mom, counsin and could have died on our way back from the hotel to our resort in the completely unsuitable car that was rented to us.  Have you ever been in a rental car with over 50K miles on it?  Payless rented me a car with 50K miles on it.  That should have been the first clue.  But on a quick inspection of the car nothing seemed amiss.  As we're driving and hit about 65 mph the steering wheel starts shaking.  Not a good sign.  As we aproach the resort I hear a noise.  Like the tread is coming off the front right tire.  Luckily we make it to the parking lot and upon further inspection of the tires notice they're bald with obvious bubbles in two of them.  We almost had a blow out.  Holy crap.

I had to call and call and call until I could get a human being on the phone. I tried every extension because leaving a message with a "we'll try and call you back" on the voicemail is not very comforting.  Finally after explaining to "Emily" that I could have died, she was able to talk to a manager.  They asked if I inspected the car.  I said I had for cosmetic damages, but I would assume that a rental car company would have adequate tires on their vehicles and that wouldn't be something I should have to look for.  They asked when I was bringing the car back.  "Um.  I'm not driving that car out of the parking lot."  They sent two of their mechanics over later that afternoon.  I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, but they made one of these poor guys drive that car back to the airport.  I showed him the tires and he said, "They actually rented this car to you?"  I told him good luck and I hope he doesn't die.

Now I just have to stalk my credit card statements and make sure they really did refund all my money or I will be their worst nightmare.

Paymore people.  Not less.Their website says they deliver.  After spending 20 minutes looking at their menu and putting together my $80 order, I call and I'm told "sorry we don't deliver".  Inaccurate information on a business website is a big giant no-no.  Waste of my time.It is with long consideration that I write this poor review.  The short of it is that a dispute over a copay could not be amicably resolved without an unpleasant discussion.
I had been a happy patient/customer on and off for nearly 5 months. I tore my Achilles tender and calf muscle and was slowly rehabilitating my injuries. I have never missed a copayment during this period. Due to large part because Endurance rehab has a system in which the patient can not go into the treatment room without the door being unlocked. The door is only opened when payment is made. So, you can imagine my surprise when I was told that I had missed a payment.  I told them that I'm sure I made the payment but that I will check my on line banking account to make sure. I make payments with my debit card. Once home I check my records and it was clear that the payment was made. When I came in for my next treatment. I told them that the payment was made and their response was that I needed to have a print out of my payment history. Now I haven't done this before so I call my bank for help. Isolating payments to one retailer is not a minor task.  The statement has balance information and my husband didn't want us to share it with Endurance Rehab. After considerable time on the phone I got the payment history. But it had our checking balance on it. We were not willing to share that info with Endurance Rehab.
My next appt. I told them that my husband & I don't want to share banking balances with them. It got unpleasant from there. The woman at the counter said that she was done arguing with me and that she was going to take care of the discrepancy.  This had been going on for a week and a half. 

The bottom line is that customer service is a problem with Endurance Rehab.  I can not recommend this Physical Therapy to anyone. There are too many to choose from.Never ever think of coming here.  This place treated with me such disrespect.  During our negotiation i was told and I quote "i was being unrealistic and should realize that, since I've been to college!  So in so many words I shouldn't be so dumb.  Being a college grad this offended me and i was so upset with the insulting blow i had just been given i reported him to a manager who apologized for his arrogant belittling comment.  Then it gets worse, I get put in front of an even more condescending manager who then tells me I should do more research and that this was a fair deal. He then says " could I sell it to you for less, sure but why would I?  He said were not desperate to make a sale cause they're the #1 jeep dealer in AZ.  To me this is a disgusting way to treat your customers no matter how many trophy's are in your lobby. The best part is he keeps going on to say spend more money and you'll be happier?  Is this your sales pitch?  To me that was so pathetic that he felt the need to say that, to save face.  Then he had the nerve to say that he wanted a copy of the review I was going to write on yelp!!!  I told him he could read it himself on the website if he actually cared.  where is your professionalism?  Worst experience ever!!! Ruined my day.  Not only were their adds misleading, like most dealerships of course.  This place had the nerve to be so arrogant to me, it escalated the longer I negotiated.  Go here if your comfortable over paying and like dealing with some serious jerks.At first, I read all the reviews and I was like why not? I was looking for a good barber where I lived since I recently have moved. 

I had to wait an hour in order to get my haircut when I was the only person in line. The place did not have a barber shop feel and the guy was ridiculous. I took 45 min to cut my hair and I all I get is a fade. I am in the military so my haircut is really really easy. I took forever. I was like when is this going to end but if it looked good, Id accept it and find another place but it was not good at all. The guy was really bad. The place was hot too.I moved here in August of 2012. Initially I was blown away, thinking WOW what an awesome place to live. Not only is it gorgeous but it's a location close to ASU, where I go to class. 

You know what they say though, looks can be deceiving.

I looked over the contract for days. I wanted to make sure I knew what I was getting myself into. I moved into a 3 bedroom townhouse where rent including utilities averaged around 1750.00 per month....trust me when I say it is NOT worth it.

They don't tell you about the insane $1,000+ move-in fees, and they won't tell you that if there's even a single stain on the carpet that they'll be charging you $1,200 to rip out the entire carpet when it's time to move out, not including any other damages that will occur throughout the year. In the course of my 12 month lease the dishwasher broke and was NEVER replaced despite the many phone calls I made to maitenance. Neither was my shower drain, or my lights, or my screen door that fell off after an insane monsoon storm. They tell you the 24-hour help service will be there for you no matter what! Lightbulbs are complimentary and feel welcome to call at 2 in the morning....I know that occurances were MY job to fix, but when I have to wait 3 days for an exterminator to come knocking on my door only after I find black widows in my bathroom, that's when enough is enough!!!! Expect to wait at least 3 days before your request even gets noticed...if it does at all.

Security guards harass you if you're at the pool after 10pm, which in a college location in the big city, good freaking luck trying to have a good time. If you're looking for a quiet place to study in the late hours of the night, better make sure you head to a coffee shop or late library. The walls in this apartment complex are super thin, and there's nothing one loves more than hearing your newly-wed neighbors in the wee hours of the morning. The clubhouse the apartment complex raves about closes at 6pm sharp, and they WILL kick you out even if your table is covered in books. Another thing...expect all these snooty letters to be dropped off at your doorstep. I can't tell you how many of these I got. My neighbors smoke and I was the one getting letters saying IF YOU DON'T PICK UP THOSE CIGARETTE BUTTS, WE WILL FINE YOU $75. Also, YOUR CHRISTMAS LIGHTS ARE TOO BRIGHT. NOISE COMPLAINT. WE DON'T LIKE THE FLOWERS ON YOUR PATIO. Yada yada yada. I got these on a weekly basis. 

If you can't stand it anymore you're better to just try and deal until your lease is up. It costs $2,000+ to break lease. My roommates and I had had it with this place so we all agreed to chip in the money to get out. 

That's when it hit the fan.

The office told us that they were about to go under new management and that it would cost an additional $1500 from the new contract to move out, bringing our breaking lease total to over $3,500. Even though this was NOT written in our previous contract and we were not notified of the new management in any way!They absolutely refused to let us out until this was paid and they told us we had to wait an additional 60 days for the paperwork to get processed, and charge us for the additional $1750.00 months rent each month until then.

So lets do the math. $3500 to break lease plus two months rent.....WTF?!!!! Oh and while we were waiting on paperwork to process, we were notified of a new way to pay rent. 1 check per person. No more individual payments. Each offense was $50. 

Absolutely ridiculous and unprofessional. The staff are no help whatsoever and the new manager has no clue what's going on. It's been 4 months since I moved out now and I'm STILL getting harrassing phone calls from the office bringing up all these seperate fees from nowhere. Disgusting people will try to get all the money out of you no matter what.

I'm still in my early 20s and I did not need this. I managed to get out safe but my other roommates have marked credit records now because of this mess. Just what we need graduating school right?

DO NOT MOVE HERE. THEY WILL SWINDLE YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU HAVE GOT AND THEY LIE RIGHT TO YOUR FACE!!!

Thanks for the worst 12 months of my life.If I could give them 0 stars, I would.  I cancelled my membership with Snap because I moved.  I notified Jeremiah and he said my membership would be cancelled and that he needed me to bring by a written 30 day notice.  I did.  Ii was billed for 2 months payments soon thereafter.  Now, It has been a few months since then and I'm still getting billed by them. 

I called and left Jeremiah him a message ... no response.  

I called the corporate office and they said that they would reach out to the local franchise and someone would get back to me.  I asked how long that would take and they didn't have an answer.

Gag!buyer beware: had problems with this company, looked up roc # to find out it is suspended, used to be freedom airThis Banfield murdered my dog and refused to pay for the emergency vet bills that occurred while trying to save him. After a minor procedure the vet wrapped a bandage so tight that it prevented him from panting properly which rose his temperature and caused his death.Do you remember being a little girl and begging for a bedazzler for Christmas? Desperately wanting to bling out your jean jackets and rhinestone your name on your backpacks? Do you still carry a torch for all things bedazzled? If so this is the store for you. 

From blinged out shirts to booty bedazzled jeans, you can find here and it has been covered in faux diamonds and rhinestones. There are also a ton of the dragon/angel/tattoo looking shirts that some ladies are so fond of. 

I don't know if  I should give this place one star or five stars.. I guess it really just depends on your taste in clothing. I wouldn't be caught dead in anything they sell here. But I know a few ladies that may be willing to trade in a Michael Jackson purse for a sparkling hat with "Hot Thing" written in rhinestones.To sum up Benedict's in a word: limited. The menu. The seating. The portions. The pre-mixed breakfast burrito filling that can't be altered to order. The irony that eggs benedict isn't on the weekday menu. Because of this I'm limiting Benedict's to a single star.

Response to Owner: Here's the rub Dawn. During my experience at Benedict's I asked that my burrito come sans onions and the response from an employee was "I'm sorry, we're not able to do that". So either your employees are misinformed, I was lied to, or you're calling me a liar. I'd love to know which one Dawn. At any rate, I'm sure your cafe does fine in Scottsdale, but living here in the Choice City we simply have different standards. Thanks for the shamelessly self promoting comment anyway. All the best.Since this place was so close to my house and I was dying for new nails, I decided to check this place out. Worst decision ever. I went in, looking for a mani and pedi and came out with bloody nails. I told them specifically not to cut my cuticles but guess what they did? That's right. The guy who did my nails was rough with my hands and constantly made me bleed profusely. I ended up paying $35 and I am thoroughly disappointed and upset with this place. Not worth the time or money at all.If I can give NO STAR to Cosmo, I would.  
We had horrible experiences with THE Cosmopolitan.   No matter how beautiful your decors are in the hotel, I don't sleep at the lobby or the bar area at night.  I rather you provide us with decent services instead. 

First strike, the toilet was full of shit stains when we arrived the room.  You don't have any excuses of given an uncleaned or unready room to your guess especially when you charge so much. 


Second strike, we were wakening by a loud "BANG" sound at 6:58 a.m..  I thought was earthquake, actually it was the cable box from the TV dropped and broke the table lamp.  We had to called the customer services right away to get the mess fix, and it took the technician about 40 minutes to arrive.  And another 10 extra minutes for the housekeeping department to clean up all the broken glasses.  

For all the yelpers, don't you guys feel bad for me at this point, it is literally Vacation Nightmare."  

Third strike, The same night of the Fallen Cable Box disaster, the Housekeeper never came by to fix our bed, change the towels, and make the room.  BTW, We tipped the Housekeeper whom cleaned the broken glasses from that morning.  
It is HORRIBLE.  Called in to request them to get our bed fix, and we made a request to have them please come by after 5 p.m. because we were tired from the morning disaster and all the sightseeing, and the coordinator was agreed to send someone over around 5.  

So, half an hour passed from the time I called, someone knocked on our door.  It was the housekeeper and we have to send them back.  I almost had a heart attack.  I have to talk to someone that understands about services and accommodations.  The manager got on the phone with me and explained that "the housekeepers get off at 5 pm and no one can provides us services after that time."  HOW come no one told me that when I make my first request.  And the manager explains" We didn't anticipate the back up."  WHF are you talking about, and Is it your first day as a manager for such a high end hotel?????? 

Never trust the housekeeping services from COSMOPOLITAN.  I rather stay at Wynn Encore, they are much better with services and everything else.  COSMO, you suck and you failed on us over and over again.  Will never recommend anyone stay at COSMO.doing another review...WORST customer service experience I've ever seen.  No signs saying where to go once you step outside, they just say "GO PICK A CAR" and that's it.  I drove up to ask a question on what to do next, and they FREAKED out and yelled at me for driving near the car port.  FREAKED OUT....literally had me feeling like a bomb went off, when all I did was park under the car port.  Then they shooed me away like I was the biggest inconvenience, and never answered my question on where to get a damage slip, and what to do next.   Workers just sit there on their phones, never look at you when you need help, and talk down to you.


Biggest inconvenience, terrible customer service...not worth saving a dollar.

PURE ASSHOLES.Fox rent a car... Saved $15 but got nothin but irritation... Never again... Waited an hour and a half to even fill out paperwork when i arrived. If you book through a 3rd party rental site (ie expedia), your info is not populated so they have to slowly and manually type it in. The CSRs seem to not be well informed of their own company's policies. Example, my credit card was used to authorize the rental but i was informed i could pay cash upon return. I returned and was again informed i could go inside and pay cash. The rental return booth outside had a sign that directed customers to go inside to pay cash. I got inside, was greeted with attitude by a CSR that informed me since i was paying cash i would have to wait for a manager but he didnt know if, when or where a manager might be... Then when i  was finally assisted, i was informed that i could NOt pay cash, there was no cash box and fox never accepted cash as a payment. Less than adequate customer service, endless miscommunication and attitude, and forget trying to call the 800 number 

#fox #foxrentacar #foxrentacarsux #dontdoit #saveyourselftheaggravation #spendtheextramoneyforbetterservice #wasteofhoursofmylifeYelp please give us a Zero star score. This is an awful company. They prey upon the poor, minorities and those who truely want to make their credit better. They charge fees like a Las Vegas Craps table ( the expensive ones) Charging hundreds of dollars in imaginary fees a month. They can't answer your complaints. They have a phone bank in the Phillipines with customer disservice employees who you can hear in the background all reading the same script. Frightening that this exists in AmericaChecked in online and was 1st on list when I got there. 2 people were taken before me. What the hell is the point to use the app? (happened in 12/2012)

The manager needs to educate the staff at this location.OMG! Where to begin? First of all I chose this dog groomer based on my positive experience with Bone Appetit in Southern Highlands where their dog groomers are "Top Notch" and their convenient location to my home.  Sad to say the location at W. Azure Bone Appetit has nothing in common with a the highly professional Southern Highlands Bone Appetit!  I first visited the W. Azure in April 2013 and found their store to have minimal everything it looked as if it had just opened it's doors or was going out of business but I spoke with the owner and she assured me "Sherry" was a " Great " groomer and she DID do everything I asked for my Lil Shih Tzu. I returned again in June 2013 and spoke with the same owner and she said Sherry was no longer with them but the groomer that trained Sherry now worked there "Martha" so I booked and appointment with Martha for the next day. On arrival Martha received my Lil Shih Tzu and listen to my preferences with what I thought was her dog bather "Danny", two hours later they called and said she was ready. On arrival my dog was not ready! They were still working on her and she was not groomed as asked so I stood there until they finished her. I paid and tipped $46 and found on my way home that her paws were still dirty and her nails had not been trimmed with dirt under them, her brows were cut so short her eyes tear constantly.  I called to complain on my arrival home to the owner she stated, "well Martha did not do your dog, Danny did and he is in training", I replied, I made and appointment with Martha and gave my pup to Martha with instructions so why would Martha let my dog out of their business with her endorsement if she was training someone and without checking their work first? She of course had no answers and made no attempt to correct or assume responsibility for this matter. Only  then I went on line to read the YELP reviews I only wish I had done this sooner. You can bet we won't be back in the future now matter how close they are to our home. If anyone else lives in this area and knows of a "Good" groomer and professional business please let us know.  Phyllis G.In OUR OPINIONS precision plumbing IS THE WORST.  We would NEVER NEVER EVER use this company ever again!  Believe us if we could rate -0- stars we would or even MINUS STARS better yet.  IN OUR OPINIONS.......I have to agree with the majority of the reviews here. This place does not even warrant a star. I will say the staff was very apologetic, but Dr. D Wachs bedside manner is HORRIBLE!!! I do not care what type of radio show she has the patients are customers that keeps her in business. As a referral from another doctors office I will let them know that Dr. Wachs is not worth the referral.This store sucks !! Don't tell me what form of payment to use what if I don't want to use cash what if I would rather accumulate points . Don't use sharpies for your brows either I can't take you seriously .Found an insect in my Chalupa. Don't eat here unless you're training for fear factor.I received a certified mail today from RHC Desert Enterprises, LLC stating they were notified of my recent Yelp review for Anytime Fitness and have enclosed documentation for my records. In their letter they stated, "We are a little concerned as to why you are writing your review dated 3/4/2012 for a transfer that occurred 6/21/10 and a cancellation request that occurred 10/7/2011." 

First off, they included a supposed membership/transfer change form that was "signed" by my boyfriend that was FORGED. Forged meaning it is NOT his signature and we have an ample amount of documents spanning years that shows this. Another thing was that whoever signed and forged the document, hand-wrote the date "6/20/07" not once, but TWICE. The gym wasn't even open in 2007 neither were we contracted gym members with them in 2007. And according to the very helpful gentleman I spoke to from the Henderson location today, that gym wasn't even open in 2007. So, forgery and incorrectly dating the membership transfer/change form from the date in which they provided is now proven. 

On another note, in stating, "We are a little concerned as to why you are writing your review dated 3/4/2012 for a transfer that occurred 6/21/10 and a cancellation request that occurred 10/7/2011" boggles my mind. I wrote the review on that date after continuously being charged numerous times after I believed I had canceled the membership WITHOUT being notified about the transfer to begin with. Continuously being charged 5+ months after I requested the cancellation certainly explains writing the review on 3/4/2012. 

Also, they asked in the closure of the letter "politely to edit your review to remove personal names regarding ownership. The information you have posted is inaccurate. The club that was previously located at 11710 W. Charleston Blvd. is owned by the above listed LLC." First of all, in my hands I hold TWO business cards with both individuals I have previously mentioned with the title of "Owner" right beside their names. So, if the information I have posted is "inaccurate," it sure didn't appear that way when I signed up for the gym membership. And now that the gym is closed, I begin to wonder.

READY FOR THE MOST IRONIC PART?! As I was staring at the certified mail envelope and looking at the return address as: "RHC Desert Enterprises LLC prior DBA (Anytime Fitness)" I question... WHAT ON EARTH DOES RHC STAND FOR?! Then, the lightbulb moment hits me... Ronald Heather Clifford?! Could it be?! The two "owners" I mentioned in my first Yelp review could be behind this letter I received? So I looked up the business and what do you know, Heather Clifford is listed as the registered agent of the company. Please, if you wanted to rid your name of any wrongdoing and poor business practices, then admit it--admit it and be done with it. DO NOT falsify information and accuse me of being "inaccurate."

After reading this letter, I now am faced with an even bigger issue that I feel may require legal representation. Thank you Anytime Fitness and RHC Desert Enterprises, LLC. I will be in contact.We used V Transportation for our group of ~20 people during a festival.  Interacting with V Transportation was a miserable experience for everyone.  As the other reviews suggest, DO NOT use them.

At first, the driver was inflexible about pick up and drop off times, threatening to leave members of our group behind when we were not all at the right place at exactly the right time.  But that was not the worst of it.

Our driver literally screamed and pointed his finger at our coordinator for giving him directions on when to pick us up.  He was extremely upset that a young woman from out of town was giving him orders and insisted upon only speaking with the male members in our group.  When he yelled at our female coordinator in front of the entire group, he made her promise repeatedly that she would never call him again.  He screamed several times that he had rights too, and that a woman should not be contacting him ever again to coordinate our pick up times.  Obviously the driver's actions were entirely inappropriate and most likely illegal.

The driver yelled at male members of our party as well.  We were never disrespectful; we even followed their demands to pay them in advance in cash.  The driver took his anger out on our group and made the experience a lot less fun for everyone.Don't know this side of town well so I am embarrassed that I got there shortly before closing and couldn't apologize more to the staff yet it didn't work. 

Staff members were terribly rude and I know they don't own the place but its just paper products... its not that complicated... 

Asked for some shipping advice since I had awkward shaped packages..and was starred back at with an empty glaze...you got the jist...They only let one person in at a time after 8pm. Dont know why since there were at least 3 employees at the register. i would understand if there was only 1 person working but that wasnt the case. they lock the door and watch you from the inside. there was a family of 3 in there taking their sweet time and didnt seem to look like they were getting anything. after 15 mins of waiting, i left. i didnt get a chance to go in to get what i needed. i gave this place 1 star because the store is fully stockedTried this car wash a couple times a year ago and was not happy with their service.  Today I decided to give them another try.  I got the highest level car wash which was $34.99.  I was reminded why I stopped going here and why I will never go back.  After completing the car and upon my inspection I discovered they didn't even vacuum the rear interior or bother to wipe the seats.  The manager was apologetic and had it redone.  I drove away without re-inspecting but looked at the back interior when I got a block away and was amazed they still hadn't  wiped the interior.  There was still dirt all over the seat trim.  I took the car back and they lazily whipped it down.  Still marginally clean I left in frustration and will never return.  I've talked to a few people today who say they've tried this car wash and were disappointed.  Don't waste your money or time here.Dreadful!  Went there Saturday night with a Travelzoo coupon that apparently identified us as unwelcome guests.  They sat us at the worst table ever & refused to move us even though we asked them to & there were other tables available.  We were in the middle of traffic & the table was so small that we had to put things on the floor to fit our food. The food was fair, the service was fair & the margaritas were quite tasty but I thought overpriced at $12.  The kicker was when they added an 18% tip for a party of two with no notification. We usually tip a minimum of 20% & found this insulting & a little underhanded.  We are locals & we will not be returning & will not be recommending this place.Horrible experience.  Rude staff, yogurt didn't taste great.  Yogurt land is just up the street and is 100x better!This location does not have good service. Went through drive-through and they forgot our drinks and our sides. While they were preparing what they forgot, we could see another girl who had her back to us and it was obvious that she was on her phone. Any other KFC would be better.Not only the worst BK franchise I've ever been to... but probably the worst-managed restaurant franchise I've ever encountered. It's a like a bad (bad) movie...

OPEN ON two guys and a girl in a GREEN SOUL ordering drive through from Burger King on East Wash. They are hungry, but their order is easy. Just three burgers, twp fries, and one drink.

AUDIO OVER (BK INTERCOM VOICE, with a bored lackluster air): "Okay, drive up to the window."

The CAR pulls up behind two other cars waiting for their orders. And they wait. And wait. And wait. Six minutes later, the first car finally gets their food and drives off.

The CARS pull up closer. And they wait. And wait. And wait.

A few minutes later, two uniformed BURGER KING EMPLOYEES, one man and one woman, exit the restaurant. They hang out in by the waiting CARS in front of the restaurant. Chatting for a few minutes, then amble back into the restaurant.

The CARS continue to wait. Minutes more pass.

Two more BURGER KIND EMPLOYEES, two women, exit the store with a TODDLER in tow, but they are carrying huge bags of BK food.

The DRIVER of the GREEN SOUL, "This is ridiculous, we've been waiting over 10 minutes, I'm getting out of here.  Mickey D's is right over there.... Wait... Hey, are those BK employees carrying out FOOD?!"

BURGER KING EMPLOYEE #1, puts up her arm carrying a huge bag of TAKEOUT and uses her body to physically block the GREEN SOUL from leaving. The TODDLER wanders aimlessly and dangerously around the parking lot.

The CAR in front of the GREEN SOUL receives their order finally, and drives off. The CAR waiting for food behind the SOUL peels out of line, barely missing the wandering TODDLER.

BURGER KING EMPLOYEE #1 (shouting at the CASHIER through the window): "How long have these nice people been waiting?! 

CASHIER (searching for the order ticket): "Um... 15 minutes."

BK EMPLOYEE #1 (shouting): "Well, give them two free ice creams for making them wait so long!"

SOUL PASSENGER #1 (quietly): "It's okay, we just want the food we ordered.... And, besides, there are three of us. Not two."

BK EMPLOYEE (angrily shouting through the cashier window): "Just get them some ice cream... they were almost going to leave, you guys are so slow. Lucky I stopped them. You're the manager. Manage!"

A few more minutes pass. One single ICE CREAM is passed through the window to the waiting passengers. Then, finally, a BAG with the burgers and fries arrives. The GREEN SOUL drives off down East Wash. Watching carefully to be sure the wandering TODDLER isn't in the way.

SOUL PASSENGER takes a bite out of his burger, and spits it out into a napkin: "Oh my god! How in the hell did they ruin a Whopper, for chrissakes!? 

SOUL DRIVER: What's wrong with it?

SOUL PASSENGER #1: "It's cold. And I mean cold. It doesn't taste like meat. It's just rubbery and tasteless... and where's the char-broiled taste? Did they forget to add it? The cheese is in no way melted. There's a wilted mass of white lettuce core shoved in the middle, like a bad surprise. The bun crusty and stale.... do I need to go on--?

SOUL PASSENGER #2, sampling a french fry: "And my fries are soggy and cold, too.... and no ketchup packets in the bag. And my bun's stale, too!"

SOUL DRIVER starts to laugh: "that was so bad, I expected cameras to come out of the door next, 'smile, you're on candid camera!"

SOUL PASSENGER #1: "Or 'Punked."

SOUL PASSENGER #2: "We were punked, all right. Let's ditch this sorry excuse for food and order Culver's... the food is always hot and delicious there. And the staff is nice and helpful, too.

The GREEN SOUL exits East Wash, and on the way into CULVER'S, PASSENGER #1 exits the vehicle, and throws the BK bags of food away in the CULVER'S garbage can. 

SOUL PASSENGER #2 getting back into the car: "Never again."

SOUL PASSENGER #1 and SOUL DRIVER: "Never again!"

THE END.I sent this review in and all Dairy Queen said was thank you for your feedback.  Nothing more.  No follow up.  Gross.Wow! So I work at a prison and I've had inmate meals occasionally, so there is a certain standard of food and taste that I have developed. It's really not that hard to please me with food, especially after having prison food but Sam's cafe really questioned whether or not I was an inmate that night. 

I ordered one of their specials, which was the pork enchiladas. When I got the tray, I initially thought they had mistaken the dish for a three rolled tacos, with mole-like sauce? First I had to decipher if it was fried, which was later confirmed. Then the sauce on top was definitely something that you cannot label. It had a sweet, mole, yet bitter taste, with sour cream that was light and fluffy and made it look like whip cream. I know . . . strange you say? The pork was dried out and even the two of us could not finish this one meal that was split. The beans tasted hallow, if that's even possible and the rice was extra dry. 

I am sorry to give this such a harsh review, but it's the truth and sometimes the truth hurts. I have to say they do have great margaritas and the best part was the complimentary white chocolate, pecan thing they gave at the end. Sorry Sam's but this will be my first and last time.Had this for lunch one day before work - bad move. I was totally useless all afternoon as I felt like I had a brick of acid eating away at my stomach lining.Wow! I can't believe this place gets so many good reviews. 
I was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal. But, how much value does your lunch dollar have when you don't even want to eat the food? Dry and sticky rice; "white meat chicken" unidientifiable as such, and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor. Quite frankly, it was disgusting, and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them). I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall. The one star is only for the fast and friendly service.I was really disappointed at my experience here. It looks nice enough, kind of like a Hard Rock Cafe. The wait staff were dressed comfortably, even if they have to wear eyeliner stuff under their eyes. They were very nice. That's about it for the good stuff. When someone orders the Big Unit (made famous by Man vs Food), a super annoying bell goes off and all the wait staff stop what they're doing and yell "BIG UNIT!" That got old after the third one. I definitely couldn't work there. The big disappointment, though, was the food. I got the BBQ sampler thing and my husband got nachos. The tortillas were soggy and when you picked one up, everything slid off it so all you got was soggy wet chips and no toppings. Even when you scooped it up with a fork or whatever, the toppings didn't taste very good. As for mine-it all tasted like (and had the texture of) stuff that had been cooked in a boil-in-the-bag meal. The sauce was SUPER sweet, and none of the meat had the slightest flavor or appearance of having been even wafted through smoke. All I really ate were the fries, and they were the battered kind, which are gross. All in all I was super, SUPER disappointed and won't be back OR recommend this place to others.Ok, first of all, when I got there this morning to pick up my lunch,  the guy behind the counter was hitting on the gal in front of me so hard.  He spent all of his time and smiles on her that by the time he got to my order, he had not an ounce of friendliness left.  He acted like he was doing me a favor, begrudgingly.  That in itself is nothing, I have lowered my expectations of customer service since this new generation of pimple popping orgy addicts got their work permits a few years ago.  However, when I got the foot-long turkey sammi back to my office, the half I chose for breakfast had a little good morning suprise. (I just threw up in my mouth a bit.)
They should change their slogan from "Eat Freash!" to "Eat Some Complete Stranger's Hair, Then Gag and Lose Your Appetite Completely".  I'll bet that is the real reason Jared lost all that weight.  
Not happy Subway.  There is  a lovely Quiznos on Central and Camelback... They will serve my periodic sub sandwhich needs from now on.
AND DON"T CALL ME MAAM YOU IDIOT!  And get your teeth cleaned! That yucky yellow stuff is called tartar and it can be removed.After one bit of my grilled chicken sandwich, I instantly regretted going here. The lettuce was slimy, the mayo tasted rancid and the chicken was not hot. I threw out he sandwich. It was disgusting.Underwhelming - attention to detail is lacking. Carpets are dirty, empty bottle of wine in the fridge when I opened it for the first time, the AC was not running when I checked-in so the room smelled musty - like beer was being fermented in the bathtub. There are no electric plug near the bed - I was to be sitting on my bed and charging my phone and working on my computer. Wifi is free but does not reach to my room... Come-ON!a dirty li.ttle hole.had a roach crawl on my hand. Joyce the bartender just laughedThere has been so much anticipation to go to G&D for Karaokee on mondays.  After a great bbq we all decided to go and sing our hearts out...well we arrived at about 10pm...added our names to the list...cheered othered singers on to encourage a good time, spent some money and tipped well....and waited patiently....well after 2.5 hours have gone by we had seen the same three girls go up the several times before we have...we get it...if they got there before us and signed up, its their turn...but then the host started singing songs and kept picking "random" chicks to sings songs...ok...now its getting weird.  Then when we saw the person that signed up right before us go up and then one of the same "three" girls and then the host "randomly" pick again.....we got pissed of and were ready to leave.  We were pissed and cashed out.  Then when we told the karaokee host that he was an ass and that we had been waiting over 2 hrs and were pissed, he pretty much talked crap and walked away.  Then he had the nerve to call our names when we walked right out of the door.  We came back in and talked to management.  We were there to have a good time and spend money.  I would rather spend my money elsewhere.  Star karaokee sux, IDK what the hell Michael the Karaokee host from star karaokee's problem was, but he was completely unprofessional and just plain RUDE.  We get it, you have your regulars, but we are cusotmers too.....we would have brought more people back in the future...but you can have fun with the same three people for your pitiful karaokee night.So many better breweries than this! Attempted to use a 50$ gift cert and was told (after I ordered beers ) that they could only be used in $15 increments once a year... I was still responsible for the beers because she had poured them. She conferred w mgmt, same response. I explained I don't live anywhere near there and would never use them again. Her response was "well.. You can always... Well... Uh, just give them away."  Great, I'm sure that was the intended use when a friend gave them to me for my birthday.  If the "mgmt" of a local place doesn't have the  sense to make it a worthwhile experience for their paying customer, then what is there to do? Very disappointed in their service. Ps I've bartended before and never seen someone grab the ticket and then dunk it on top of the drink they have going out.  I witnessed this time and time again. She would grab and hold the ticket, then dunk into the top of the beer. The waitress would grab the beer and scoop out the ticket. Necessary? No. I will not be back.Just left early from Arizona Opera Lucia Di Lammermoor. It was horrible. I felt like I was at a high school production! Their is no sound production and the performers do not wear mikes. So you are in a fairly large hall (the symphony hall to be exact) and all you can hear are these tiny voices from the stage. I could've had the same experience watching it on my IPad. DO NOT waste your hard earned money. They should be ashamed to pretend this is a true opera!I made the mistake of going here on a whim. Awful, shitty bland Mexican food. A waste of money and my butthole was angry with me.Looks like a great store, with reasonable prices - I wanted to get a bouquet primarily based on snapdragons.  I priced out what would be reasonable based on the listed prices, and was told that they have a 2.50 fee PER FLOWER to arrange (meaning take out of the container and wrap in paper) - more than doubling the cost.  I was ready to spend 90 bucks for 2 simple bouquets.  

I have never experienced a flower shop do this.  Most of the time, I walk into a shop, state what I'd like and a price range l, and they would pick and choose for me, making a beautiful paper wrapped bouquet - and charge the per flower price listed.  The guy at this shop simply said "not going to happen" and walked away.  At least he could have been nicer.

Such a shame, it seemed to get good reviews, and is conveniently located.

*** turns out the picture I put up was of the wrong guy.  Trying to remove!Overpriced and dirty.  Had lunch here with my wife and service was ok but salad they served was stale and moldy.  Ordered a raisin croissant, looked and tasted like it was about 4 days old which surprised us they would serve and charge for that.  Probably won't go back since there are better options in the area, scratch, chez vous, ect.Bed bugs! 2 of us in 2 different rooms, both fairly badly bitten. Property were actually combative, denied they had a problem, accused us both of lying and apart from offering to do our laundry (with a number of caveats attached) did nothing. Miserable customer service from a battered, tired, dirty & old facility.Went in today for a bagel an cream cheese. I used to always get a sun dried tomato bagel and today I found out it's discontinued. :( I will not be coming back anymore.Pretty ghetto. Cash only and Mexican food for gringos, ie not good. They charge you for more chips.We always try to find a local business to support and found good reviews on yelp for Pat's Pizza Plus. Geez. I have no idea where the good reviews came from. The pizza had zero sauce on it, it was lukewarm upon pick-up and the salad was being stored on top of the pizza so it was lukewarm as well. We won't be trying this place again. We'll stick with Spinato's!This is a terrible place to try to take a large group.  The food is mediocre at best.  But they run the place poorly.

We called ahead to see if they could seat a party of 8.  They told us that they could not take our name over the phone, instead we had to show up to put our names in.  My wife went ahead and reserved the table.  She was told it would be 45 minutes.  She came home and we began getting the kids ready.  We showed up 15 minutes before we were told, but they had already given the table away.  We were told that it would be another half hour before we could be seated.  

Unfortunately, their waiting area is very packed and does not hold 8 comfortably.   We left, I will never go back.  It should not be a hassle to take your family out to eat.  The main reason for eating out is to avoid hassle.  Spinato's does a good job of making life difficult.You get what you pay for. I may as well have let my kids paint my toenails. Not to mention the tech was rough and cut/pinched several of my toes during my pedicure.   Not impressed. I definitely won't be back.I liked that they offer respray if you find critters within 21 days of spray, but after 3 months of service, have had to have re-sprays EACH month. Paying extra to treat for scorpions and there are now scorpions galore and worse than prior to exterminating...

And to make matters worse, they give a 2-3 hour window to be home and twice now, have not met that window or bothered to call to let me know they were not going to make their time slot, leaving to to reschedule and play the "wait around for the bug guy" all over again.

Do yourself a favor and find a more reliable company.My warranty company sent them to my home to replace a valve on my evaporative cooler. A guy shows up and starts working on my AC unit. Claimed there was a clog in the valve. Funny, 'cause the AC was working just fine. I directed him to the evaporative unit and he then said he would be back the next day with the part. I called the next day to find out about what time he would come and I was told they didn't know he was coming back. He did show up, tinkered on the roof a bit, came down and shoved his paper work at me, and I signed. I tried out the unit later in the evening, let it run about 40 min., turned it off and found the problem had not been solved (water continues to run after unit is turned off. Simple valve replacement.) Not only was the evap not fixed, but when I got up the next morning water was running out of the vent in my kitchen! I called and got a very rude Ken on the line who said gruffly, he would have to take care of it himself. It never happened. Ken did show up after I put a stop payment on the check I gave them. He did stop the water from running out of the kitchen vent, but never did fix the evaporative cooler. I had the same conversation with Ken 4 times. I couldn't figure out if it was Ground Hog day or just like two parrots having a conversation. It has been 28 days and I have gotten nowhere with these people. They never initiated a phone call to me, except to find out why the check was returned. Like the previous reviewer, I was surprised at how annoyed they seemed each time I called. Well, Now I am annoyed and I am DONE!!!Nice studio but horrible reputation in the community. I found Eric (owner) to be very short-tempered. He actually made people in class leave in tears!

He never takes your opinions into consideration and always tries to dismiss you.  

Classes are always packed, lots of noise before class (everyone is talking) so if you want to go early to meditate or relax a bit before class that is out of the question.

 
Not a positive environment to practice yoga.Not too sure of their menu in the drive thru, we decided on a 4 piece meal with 2 sides
for my friend and I.  $7.49 plus $1 extra for one being a breast comes out to about $10 total.  I get the stuff, get home and ready for our meal, and there is 2 pieces of chicken.  I called the store.  

They kid told me they asked the girl that packed it --- and she said she packed it right.  (Uh...no, cause we're looking at 2 pieces of chicken)...

I disputed that as did my friend next to me, and he said there was nothing they could do for me.  I asked him to credit my card so as not to drive back 6 miles for 2 pieces of chicken, he said he wouldn't.  

He would have the manager call me next day.  Manager doesn't call me and basically KFC just screws you--without remorse.  My suggestion is check your order if you go there, it's probably not right, and they won't care if it's not.

Value...BAD...I could have bought 2 roasted chickens for the price, and I didn't like being treated at 61, like I'm out to "take" KFC for 2 pieces of chicken that I didn't already pay for.

In my business if a customer complained they were shorted, I made it right, right away...it's not worth the bad will to turn away a customer.

So the morale....Count your chickens from KFC...they don't.Stopped in for a  Bagel-Dog. They had only one on the shelf. Looked as if it had been pre-cooked once or twice. After asking if there were any others, I was told, "Nope. That's it."
So I left it and walked out. So much for my Bagel-Dog.
It will be a long time before I go into that place again.If I could give my experience at this airport a zero I would. US Airways customer service is terrible!!! After my original flight (flying United) couldn't check me in for my final layover (with US Airways), they could me I couldn't get on the flight because it was boarding. I still had about 30 mins or so for it to take off. Without offering to see if I could fly with another airline or see any other options (beside booking me for the next morning flight). The rep was rude and a little snotty. These people need to take a class on customer service!I'd give them zero stars if possible.  Flithy insect ridden station with an unhelpful staff who misdirected me, causing me to miss my bus and connecting train.  Two televisions five feet from each other blaring at high volume drowning out the pa system that must have been built by Thomas Edison himself and sounds like the adults in a Peanuts comic.  After this trip I am never getting on a bus again.This store is huge and has lots and lots of products.  I was happy to shop searching out their sale items, until I was checking out.  They falsely advertise their sale items.  Today I went to purchase their "Camp Kids" products that were on sale at 50% off.  As I was checking out, they claimed that the paintable bobble heads were not included.  Then they claimed the other "Camp kids" products were not included as well.  All of the products that I had chosen was on the sale rack with the sale sign over it.  I specifically made sure I read the "sale sign" correctly and yet they refused to honor it.  I will never go back.  I don't trust what they advertise.  If you choose to shop their.... better check your receipt.This cleaners has become an over priced poorly managed cleaners. if you are an Ahwatukee person. . The people here are fantastic...but the end result is horrible cleaning.  My suit was shiny and pants BURNT!!  Scary...is received. Iunderstand why they want money in advance.We were in the area and decided to stop here for a late lunch.  When we entered, there were several people waiting in the front area but the dining area was less than 1/2 full.  After standing unnoticed for several minutes, we were just about to walk out when a hostess apologized for the wait and informed us that there are not enough servers to serve the entire dining area so there would be about a 15 min wait.  No problem, so we sat in the waiting area with the others.  After a couple seconds, I couldn't help but notice the extremely high-pitched, continuous noise coming from the kitchen equipment.  As much as I tried to block it out, I found myself getting almost an instant headache, which is quite rare for me.  It was at this instant that I decided this just wasn't worth the wait, no matter how good the food is! So we left and went to Chili's a couple doors down :)I thought that supporting local business's are important, so I headed to A&P for the first time today.  What a mistake as I should of checked yelp before wasting my time. I must of gotten the worst of the employees today as I was looking for trees for my yard. This particular employee told me that the only trees I should buy are desert because in 2015 or 2016 the world will be out of water for vegetation. Also, we might have drinking water but, that is it. Okay, really? Desert trees are only what he has in his yard as he told me. I don't really care what he has in his yard,  I was there for my yard, which has flood irrigation. I asked if they had delivery for the large boxed trees and he said no. I asked if they had recommendations for delivery as I have an injury to my back,and I was told there was a 3 month waiting time and that it was too late in the season to be planting trees anyway.
OMG...really? This employee either is taking too many meds or not enough. 
The owners of A & P should be reading the yelp reviews and do something about employees like this. So, I will take my wallet full of money somewhere else that might appreciate it. 
Lastly, I will say that the place was clean and organized BUT...that was the only positive note.Read below the line of this post & you'll see my prior post.  I am a regular, or was a regular now!

I never come in on Monday's,  I usually come in on Friday or Saturday.  This is the first time I ever met Bale.  I normally get served by Sarah & Jenn (who are the best & I like dearly).  

This night, Sarah served my first beer.  When Sarah went on break my beer was empty and I set my glass on the edge of the bar so the bartender knows I am ready for another.  Keep in mind, I am by myself at the end of the bar.  I see her look at my glass and walk away at least two times to serve others at the other end of the bar.  The third time I wave her down and she doesn't even give me a "I'm sorry I will be right with you" (recognition of some sort).  So I do something I never done before and that is poor my own beer.  Now, I got her attention! After explaining to her why I did what I did (the fact that she was deliberately ignoring me), Sarah comes back from her break, and I explain what happened.  Sarah knows me and was very nice about her reasons of having to kick me out.  It is illegal to pour your own beer, now I admit, I was not thinking about that at the time, yet I am glad that happened just to prove a point.  It took me doing something like that to get Bale's attention, what does that say about a person like that.

In conclusion, I was told I can come back another night, but because of my action Sarah had to ask me to leave, I want to note that Sarah has always given me great service.  However, because of one person, Bale, I will not be coming back to this bar.  I have more class than that, to let someone treat me like I am nothing, when I am a consistent customer.  The sad thing about Bale, it is people like her that leave me hopeless in seeing this local economy thrive again.  I moved back to this neighborhood to support this area, yet people like her have made me decide to move back close to my job in downtown Phoenix  Everyone has to understand, I grew up in this area.  If you're a native like me, you'll understand, if not, you probably will not care.  The bottom line is thanks to the internet consumers like me have a voice.  Bale has got to go!

Love this place.

Great dive bar, the bar tenders are really nice, they have the tall boy beers I like & mini pitchers for a good price.  

I was impressed how much a crowd this place can draw in.Went here for the first time because they had the 1.95 mens shirt special. Will never take my dry cleaning back to this cleaner. Went in to drop off my dry cleaning and they gave me a receipt with the charges. Then went to pick up the cloths and the charges on my first receipt had been calculated wrong by $20 and they would not honor the first receipt. Bad business if you want a customer to come back. One of the short sleeved shirts was charged as a sweater because it was a heavy cotton material ect. I will be going back across the street to my orginal dry cleaner.If I could give this store negative stars, I would.  I went in there on Sunday to shop for some pants for my daughter.  She is short and wide (she has down syndrome) and there are some pull on pants with pockets that she loves there, deep pockets for her cell phone.  We find 4 pair of pants in her size (amazing in itself), I got an article of clothing , and I got a printer cable.  As usual, there were only 3 cash registers open (on a sunday at noon)  so we go through the help yourself aisle.  Line moves fast and I notice that that there is a person standing right in the middle of the do it yourself lines ringing people up also, so as it's my turn, I can either pick a do it yourself or go to her, so I go to her (don't like the do it yourself).  I have 6 items, 4 exactly the same.  She tell me "you have too many items, I can't help  you."  Really, 6 items is too many for you?  So as usual, poor customer service in this store.  So I turn around, and of course every one of the do it yourself registers are now full.  So not only can she not help me, because I have 6 items (too many for her little Walmart brain to handle) but I now get to stand in line again.  I walked.  I have had very poor customer service in this store again and again, and I keep coming back.  This was the last straw.  I  have also written Walmart, and I bet you money that I will never hear from them.  It's all about volume for this company, they could really give a shit about customer service.  As long as all the people come to their stores and spend money, that's all this corporation cares about.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from Walmart.  I know they are less expensive that Safeway, but not at the expense of your sanity, and if you expect anything resembling customer service, you won't get it here.  STAY AWAY!Worst services I have ever experienced!!! They are slow, I swear they hire retarded people to work there, you would get better customer service and smarter people if you put McDonalds workers in there!! Total assholes, Worst customer services I ever experienced! I will NEVER use them again! This review is regarding the Vision Center!I just recieved HORRIBLE customer service at this store.  I went to purchase a Netbook for school.  My husband gave me his card and took mine because his account had the money in it.  I was able to swipe the card and push credit before I was ever asked for ID, then was told if I had the pin number to that card I would be able to use it but since I did not I couldn't.  To me that is suggesting credit card fraud without implicating themselves.  I left.  I went home and placed the order online, put it in my name, and set it for in store pick up.  Because the store was closing in 10 minutes I hauled butt out of the house and left my ID but had the printed reciept, with my homework on the back (I recycle).  I also had the card used for purchase, a debit card with my name, my android phone with the bestbuy emails confirming my order, my checking account reciept, and many other ways to prove I am who I am.  (Not to mention the sales associates who had helped me minutes before).  I seriously doubt, at 9 pm, someone is going to know I placed that order, come to my house and steel the reciept, and go to best buy all in a timespan of 10 minutes, but whatever.  I also told them they could look up my best buy reward zone account and I would verrify every product purchased and what store they were purchased at.  This was not happening.  I got a little irate...I had been at this for hours, been to different locations, and now was being told that after I spent hundreds of dollars with them I could not have my item. Before I ever got rude, just a little loud, I was told that my behavior would not be tollerated.  I said this is why I hate best buy no customer service.  He told me he could easily cancel my order and I could spend my money somewhere else.  REALLY??? REALLY??? They then called mall security and the cops. That is when I started cussing.  So this is how they treat the people who keep their business alive. Circut City didn't do too well...any business can fail.  Best Buy has never honored our warenties, have never been nice after we spent money with them until we were ready to spend more,  geek squad messed up my desk top so bad that even the CIS and Electronics professors at my college could not fix it (after geeksquad tried to charge me to fix their mistake)...this was the LAST straw.  I am completely done.I would not recommend this place if it was the last place to stay at!! We needed a cheap month to month place while we were buying our house no contract .. What we should have done was rented a apartment for the four months (we ended up staying two and going to an apartment month to month for the other..... We were on the ground floor and at night needed to put a towel under the door because of the roach problem not to mention the notice from other guests.. We got one coffee pouch when we first checked in but When we asked for more they told us no and that the towels were only delivered once a week when they came to clean unless we went to front desk which was fine until our personal towels went missing and were replaced by theirs ... They never did find our towels ... And insisted we not be there when they cleaned our room... Hmm wonder why... I'll quit rambling save your money and stay else where or get a cheap month to month apartment!They left dirt, hair and lint under the tint.  They gave me an appointment to take it back.  I took it back and they had it for 4 hours and still hadn't touched it. When my husband questioned the time the "manager" got mad threw a fit had the guys in the back remove the tint and gave a refund.  

Bad experience all around.the folks at my work would order this food quite often.  This doesn't say much  considering my coworkers love for strange underwhelming establishments.  You could fry a roach, call it Orange Chicken, and my coworkers will back weekly!(see Ben V.'s review)  I ordered delivery one time and was grossed out enough that I ended up throwing everything away after the first bite.  I eventually implemented a rule that we would no longer provide business to this restaurant after a terrible call we received from them.  Our company would order delivery almost weekly and would always throw quite a bit of money at this business.. Furthermore the tip would always be VERY generous.  Until one day we left a tip of... (please play dramatic countdown piano riff in your head here) 10 DOLLARS!  AHHHHHH!!! With the next order that was placed, the business contacted us to complain of the size of our tip, stating they weren't sure if they could deliver our current order if we are only going to tip blah blah blah.  Thats right, they complained about only getting a 10 dollar tip for the delivery. (the bill was only about 40-50 dollars) .  You are far better off sticking to local joints that are not only delicious but are grateful for your business. (TOTT's, dragon express, etc....)My husband and I ordered delivery from Red Dragon last night. It was the worst Chinese food I've ever tasted. The appetizer we tried was the Dim Sum Sampler, the pan fried meat dumplings tasted like they're been sitting around for days. The chicken sticks were dry and tasted old. We also ordered the fried rice instead of white, it was hard and dry. For the main course, I ordered lemon chicken. The outside was greasy, then when I cut into it, I found a hair! The chicken itself smelled bad. My husband ordered Orange Beef, which he said he couldn't eat. I had enough. I called and asked for the manager, when she got on the phone I told her I wanted my money back, she promptly hung up on me! I called back and told her I wanted my money back again and they could come and pick up the food. I didn't actually think they would, but several minutes later someone actually came to the door wanting their food back, which I gladly gave him. We only tasted it, we couldn't eat it. I will not eat anything from there again.Associated Dental does not back up their work when one of their dentists screws up and you suffer.  They are operated by a corporation that tries to keep costs as low as possible, and the result is that as a patient you get the short end of that stick.I just went in here and got some tacos for lunch.  I love taco tuesday, unfortunately, every time I go to this location, the tacos really really suck.  Hardly any meat, taco shells and meat are way overdone, not much cheese.  And they give you one sauce for 3 tacos.   I was in the neighborhood, and thought I would try it again.  I won't make that mistake again.  The FiliB's on Main and Dobson in Mesa is soooo much better than this place, at least 3 times the meat, tacos shells are crunchy without breaking your front tooth off, and they are much friendlier too.  Don't waste your time at this location, go to the one in Mesa, it will be worth your time!Bolstered by Nicole T's review, we decided to give Yangtse a rare third shot.

Oops.

The rice was still overcooked and gummy, the chicken was still overcooked and dry, the breaded dishes were still over-fried, the beef was still flavorless. And those of us who partook became what I will charitably describe as "ill."

So, hey, we did get something new out of trying it again--nausea and intestinal distress!

Three strikes, it's out, even in spite of good crab puffs and the free fried (empty) wontons with their cute little smiley face stamp on the bag.I normally don't take the time to write reviews on anything but my experience at this place motivated me to create a yelp account.  First, the owner was irritating and sarcastic. I almost wanted to tell her to leave us alone so we can eat. She must think she is something. Second, the food was average, I have had far better vietnamese food. Third, servings were small for the price we paid for. Fourth, this place is RIDICULOUSLY expensive for a vietnamese place. Last and certainly not the least... I don't recommend this place. Went there once and will never ever go back again. Bad place guys, not worth your time and money.I go to this location ALOT and yesterday I did not have a good experience. Grabbed a couple books and tried to find a table to sit in the cafe, but no seating area open at the moment. So I sat on a book aisle. About 20 mins later, a staff came by and told me I couldn't sit on the aisle. I told her the reason I sat on the floor was because there was no seating. Would I really want to sit on the floor unless I had to???? I didn't catch the lady's name, but she was an older lady. Must be having a bad day or something. But I ALWAYS sit on the floor when there are no seating and no one has ever told me to move. She walked over to the cafe and try to direct me over and pointed to a couple open tables. It was sort of rude, so I dropped off the books that I planned to purchase and left the store. I saw a bunch of people in each aisle standing and reading and she didn't seem to have a problem with that. I rate this location with 1 star due to the staff being rude.Lazy Q CLOSED in 2010.  New Owners cleaned up the place and its called JESTERS BILLIARDS.  Tons of beer, AC smoking patio with pool tables.  Re-did tables and got new cues.  Its rockin now.Not overally impressed with the quality of the lunch here. Food was average at best. They actually brought the wrong burger to my wife and instead of fixing it like a great establishment would, they simply brought her the extra toppings. Lame.I was looking forward to trying this restaurant but was very disappointed. The food was ok. Not great. But it wS the service that surprised us. When we arrived the tables around us were full. Slowly people left and the dirty dishes were left on the tables. The wIt staff didn't lift a finger to clear the tables. Really unappetizing. Our waitress never came over to check on us. She just stood around talking with a friend. I spoke to the manager and asked why the wait staff left dirty dishes unattended and was told it wasn't their job. When I left, the tables still hadn't been cleared. Speaking with the manager was ineffective. I will never return.We walked out.  Never got to eat.  The waiter was to busy hitting on the 15 year old girls sitting behind us then come up and take our order.  We waited a good 15 minutes and no love.  

Not to mention, the food looked over priced for what is was.Had high hopes as they provided a every other month service. Unfortunately trying to get them to do what they promise to do, and/or show up is a different matter.

Initial phone call was told that they will always call to confirm your appt.  Will treat both inside & outside of home. First tax. Never knew about it. No call. Found out because I found the crinkled, dirty receipt in my front yard bushes. Weeks after the date indicated on the weathered receipt. Called and asked how they could've treated the backyard as there is a lock on the gate?  Office worker who answered the phone was friendly, and worked with me in regards to my bill, and sending someone out a few days later to treat my backyard.

Never received a confirm phone call, but figured as I had Just talked to them four days earlier it was not too big of a deal. Well, I should've confirmed because no one showed up. I couldn't believe it. I left work early to be home & a no show. As it was "after hours" for the office I left a message. 

They called back two days later. Again the office gal was friendly and apologetic, we rescheduled for another date and a later time so I would not have to miss any more work than I had to.  I got out of work late & knew I would not make the 415 time so I asked my mother to go to my home and wait for the pc guy. At 5:00 pm my mom calls to say they hadn't shown up, so she had called them. She was told by the office person that the appt. was made for between 500 and 600 pm and someone would show up. I arrived home at 545' still no one had shown up. I called the office then and at 630pm to let them know no one had called, nor had shown up and I would NO longer be requiring the use of their "services."

It is terribly frustrating to deal with such unprofessional, inconsiderate, and non-communicative companies and the people they employ, who could care less about serving their customers.

I would NOT recommend this company at all.I don't like to write negative reviews, but I was so disappointed by the customer service, or lack thereof, that I received in the custom framing area of this Michael's store last night (Mon., 4/9/12), that I just had to write. First, let me state the obvious: custom framing is not cheap. I had spent over $200 to frame a couple pieces of beautiful & intricate artwork that I had bought overseas, while working in Africa. I was VERY excited to see the finished pieces, and so was waiting impatiently for the phone call from Michael's. The phone call never came, but the anticipated date of completion (yesterday) arrived, so I stopped in anyway to see if the pieces were done. The customer service rep at the custom framing desk asked for my name, and pulled out the finished pieces. I asked if they had been done for awhile, because I was curious how long they'd been sitting there completed, while I was eagerly awaiting a phone call. She told me that they were completed on the 7th, two days prior, and told me that from the notes on the sheet, someone had called me that day. My cell phone, which I NEVER turn off, was listed as the number to call. I had not received a phone call from Michael's, nor was there a missed call, nor was there a voice mail message. I politely responded, "I'm sorry, but no one called." To which she countered, "Yes, they did." To which I again responded, "I'm sorry, but they didn't." To which she again said, "Yes, they did." This went on for a few rounds before she said, "Well, phones are very strange these days." REALLY? You are going to argue with a customer who just spent over $200 on a custom framing job, insisting that I received a phone call I DID NOT receive?

It doesn't end there. I wasn't 100% happy with the way my artwork appeared in the frame and the mat, so the framing manager was called to the desk to speak with me. The tenor of this second conversation was exactly the same.

Me: "The edge of the artwork is closer to edge of the mat than I was expecting. I was hoping for a little more white space."

Framing manager: "That was the edge of the picture; it was the only way to frame it."

Me: "I bought the artwork, I remember what it looked like, and the edge of the picture was not that close to the top of the page."

Framing manager: "Yes, it was."

Me: "Again, I bought the artwork. I remember what it looked like. Maybe it was cut before it was framed?"

Framing manager: "We never cut artwork here. I'm the one that framed it. I know what it looked like. This was the only way it could be framed."

This also continued for a few more rounds. Aside from this minor issue, I was actually pleased with how the artwork looked, so I ended up taking it home as is, but I was SERIOUSLY disappointed by the haughty and argumentative attitudes of the staff, as if I was personally insulting them by suggesting that I did not receive the expected phone call, and that my artwork was perhaps not framed 100% as I expected.

Worst customer service experience I've had in a LONG time.If I could give a nostar rating for my very first experience here I would. I decided to try them out since everyone gave them a great review and they are doing the 4 garments & 1 comforter for free deal. Well upon my arrival I mentioned  the "Yelp" deal and they said that only applied to the Tempe location?!! I wonder f you go to Tempe, they tell you it only applies to the Scottsdale location. Not impressed on first contact. I walked out.Our holiday luncheon was held here yesterday.  By far the worst I have ever attended.  Waited for water, which was finally plopped down dripping by the very angry waitress; the Diet Pepsi was EXPIRED (June 2011).  Appetizers passable.  The food was AWFUL!  Beef jerky instead of Roast Beef Au Jus.  The chicken must have been boiled - flavorless and bland.  The vegetables were undercooked and hard.  Salt & pepper mercifully arrived approximately 2/3 of the way through the meal.  Seconds were had by NOBODY!!  The waitstaff had two people who looked very nice.  The guy in the shorts - really??  And why were they all so grouchy?  We should have gone to Taco Bell.   Oh - the dessert was okay.not  very pleased 2nd time around won't return.This place was hopping.....mostly regulars....half dance and half pick up joint.  If you want to go out and people watch, you'll love it.  I'd highly suggest that you not eat here.  We ordered BBQ ribs......over an hour later they came out so tough that I literally could not get one bone out....I sent them back and ordered something quick....chicken fingers....they were so overbreaded and overcooked....I couldn't believe it.  I was very disappointed.I hate this place. I feel like everyone here is party of wanna be redneck clique....


Never againVery bad customer service.  I called them to inquire about purchasing a floral arrangement for a funeral. Granted it was a holiday weekend but the holiday schedule on their website indicated they were open on that day. 

The women whom I spoke to, told me they were not open on that Sunday and also, rather smugly told me the mortuary would not accept deliveries on that day.  She told them I had to pick up the flowers today (friday), before they closed at 3pm and hold them on my own until the funeral.  When I explained to her I was not from the area and apologetically asked her if there were other florists in the area she might recommend I try given the situation, she didn't even bother to make a suggestion. Instead, she rudely told me that there probably weren't any that would be open, that their store had the most extensive hours in the city vs. other florists and besides that the mortuary would not accept delivery on Sundays.  

Regarding her last comment.  I contacted the mortuary and they confirmed that they were accepting deliveries that day.  They too seemed surprised by Cactus Flower's attitude.

Perhaps Cactus Flower's other locations are more professional or maybe I just caught this person on a bad day (she probably shouldn't have even bothered showing up for work today).  The person I spoke to obviously didn't want any business that weekend.  I agree, save your time and find another florists.  

Another florist worth trying because they were much more helpful:  Enchanted Florist.F@(& this place.  I called several times today to check in on a phone order that should have been delivered a few days ago.  The 1st time I called the kid who picked up the phone was a rude little prick and he put me on hold never to come back.  I then called several more times only to have their answering machine pick up.  I finally got someone on the phone and they tell me that they have no idea when the phone will be there which is really messed up because it has been paid for, and when it was ordered they told me the date it would be shipped and the date I would get it.  What gives?  Never use this place!  They should have their contract canceled.  Its little sh!tty stores like this that make Verizon customers switch to other carriers.The course itself is a great course. But when you drop $60.00 to play it and at the second tee you have 10 people standing there waiting to tee off it is obvious that the course management has over booked the course and don't give a darn about you waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting between and during holes. We left with four holes left as it was ridiculous. Will never play there again. If I could get a refund I would. I do not recommend playing there. Oh yes we were the 5th group off after the course had been completely cleared from a shot gun start tournament. So it was clearly over booking at its best.EDIT: THEY'RE CLOSED?!! I came to work out this morning. Recently bought out by LA Fitness, it appears that they shut their doors and cut the lights and didn't even notify their paying customer base. 

-----------------

**** (4 stars)

I'm not convinced all of the other reviews here are reviewing the same location; I'm posting this for the location near Scottsdale Rd and Shea Blvd. This is NOT a dump. It's a very nice, clean facility. I have no earthly idea why anyone would call this place a dump; I mean if these people really were reviewing the same place, assuming they didn't overhaul the place before I joined, I can't imagine what these people would think of an actually dumpy gym, because I've been in some real rat hole gyms before.

This is a great place, I'm a very satisfied customer. Yes, as they are a business they WILL give you the long-winded tour, they WILL weigh you and, using condescending tones, convince you that you need a trainer, and they WILL try to shove protein up your nose (so to speak). This wasn't the first time I had experienced this; I had a similar experience at a 24-Hour Fitness in California. And to be quite honest, I almost wanted it .. I was able to just turn my brain off and wait for the hour or two to go by while they finished their sales pitch, I knew what they were doing, I knew I couldn't get around it, and at the same time I LOVED the idea that once this was all over with I could get access to a nice gym at only $20 a month.  Since I was in a financially uncertain future but knew I needed to get in shape no matter what, I pre-paid for one full year. They told me that because of this I get another six months free. Nice! That's 18 months for only like $240. The caveat is that after 12 months I'll get charged for another 12 months and I have to voluntarily ask them for a refund. They're a business, trying to take advantage of people's forgetfulness .. I can live with that, it's not like they were double-charging me. (Then again, what is this "maintenance fee" people speak of?)

While membership is cheap, they make up for it in training and supplements sales. I tried Mountainside a couple years prior, they were flabbergasted by my questions about getting a trainer. I was shocked that they were shocked and took my business elsewhere. I took advantage of a trainer at Pure Fitness for four sessions (beyond the first two free training sessions). Four sessions cost me nearly $300, which is more than my 12 mo prepaid membership. Do I feel ripped off?  A tiny bit, but then again I know they are a business and I came willing.

Their equipment is in decent (not great) condition; the cardio machines are hit-and-miss when it comes to successful heart rate detection. They have a lot of focused weight machines in the main area and a nice big area in back for free weights and pulleys. They do have classes but I don't take advantage of them. There are TVs in the main area, but they're old CRTs (not, say, plasmas) and they're all tuned to football, baseball, or golf, and not, say, Family Guy or some other non-sports channel, which I found disappointing as really don't get into sports.

Stay out of this place during "rush hour" fitness periods (around 6:00 PM). It is disgustingly stinky and humid, with the air filled with body sweat. I nearly choked on it one day. If there's one big thing to complain about regarding their facilities it's that they don't ventilate the place as much as I wish they would.

But overall I am quite satisfied with Pure Fitness.My family insists on going to this Chipotle because they like the food.  I go next door to AJ's and buy my food because I would never eat in a place this FILTHY!  Every time I go, same thing.  I complained to management and they don't seem to care.  Doesn't matter what time we go - busy or not, tables are never cleaned, floor has food all over it.  And the bathroom?  Ugh - I won't even go there.  The health dept really needs to pay this place a visit!Awful. Went last night and ordered vodka/soda and rum/coke, both with lemons. Indifferent server needed tutorial on soda water and conferred with sushi chef.She also added that she "wasn't a bartender and that she didn't drink" She then inquired as to type of vodka and I stated bar was fine, and a double as well. She returned w/ a glass of soda; no vodka or lemon. She left to bring rum/ coke, but returned 5 min later w coke no rum, and no lemon.
We saw this was going downhill quickly so we cut our losses, and left for another local sushi place.
No need to bother coming here.The 99 cent happy Hour margarita is what we thought it was, a flavorless beverage that tastes like a snow cone minus any flavor. They do give free chips and bean dip and salsa, nothing special in that world either. Also, how can you build a restaurant in Arizona and forget to put in an outside patio. Get ride of that dumb fountain and have some outside seating.I read the reviews and still ended up going to this place.. I went in for a manicure only as I thought their prices were too high for anything else. The guy who was doing my nails, did not know how to take gel polish off.  The female worker next to him had to show him how to wrap my nails in aluminum foil, and then show him how to use the tool to get the old polish off.  I should have known at that moment, my gut said run and run fast.  But I stayed to see how it would end.  I chose my color, the guy kept wiping the brush off so that he would use only the most minimal of color on my nails (not what I wanted as I have had this color before and it should look better than clear polish on my nails).  He did not coat down to the cuticle either, he left a huge gap.  When I informed him that my nails needed to stay under the light longer than 30 seconds he argued with me.  I know that they have to be under the light for a minimum of 2 minutes (experience).  And when I told him he will have to put on a 3rd coat, he called to the female (who was helping him before) to come over and talk to me.  She did, and she ended up putting on the additional coats of polish, fixing his mistakes and being frustrated with me. When I paid, the femaile did give me a card and printed on the back that I would get $5.00 off my next visit.  I don't think going back and having a discount is worth the next visit.  I will not be going here again for sure.DO NOT GO HERE. DO NOT GO HERE. DO NOT GO HERE. 

And whatever you do, do NOT see Michael (the guy from Florida), I had a very very minor knee injury and I don t think he really knew what was wrong with my knee so instead of referring me to someone who could fix me, he had me do the wrong exercises for my knee which screwed it up really bad!!!!!

I could not walk for a month, and its been 8 months now and my knee is still horrible, I am getting my second MRI today, I ve gone to tons of doctors and other physical therapists, I don t know what he did to my knee but he screwed up it really bad. I m hoping that I don t have to get surgery. All thanks to Michael the most horrible Physical Therapist around. 

I repeat, DO NOT GO HERE. Dancing, running, physical activity, that was my life. All I had was a super super minor injury. But Michael completely ruined my knee, he ruined my life, so thanks Michael. It's been a very painful 8 months thanks to Michael from Physiotherapy Associates in Tempe. I am taking my time to write this review for everyone out there so you do not have to go through the pain that I am still going through months later.I went in to Big O Tires in Tempe last Thursday July 15th to get an oil change before I went out of town to San Diego for the weekend with my kids. I have a 2008 Saturn Outlook with 59,000 miles. I got the oil change annd everything seemed good. I got in my car and started driving down the road and noticed that my temp guage was rising a bit and looked like the vehicle was running a little warm. I continued down the road and it stayed like that, so I called Big O and they said to bring it back. When I got there, they had to let it cool and then diagnose the problem. I didn't have time to wait so I got picked up and waited for their call. They called and said I needed a new radiator($750.00) and since they had the thing torn apart, they said I should also replace the thermostat($750.00, $1,500.00 total)!!!!!! This did not seem right with lower milage and I'm a price shopper, so I called a few friends for a referral and they sent me to Paul's Car Care in Chandler off of Arizona Avenue between Ray and Warner. They told me the radiator cap was loose and could have not been put on tightly from the oil change or it was malfunctioning. Either way, it was $73.00 and I was out the door!!!! Shame on those guys at Big O who had 2-3 flunkies working on my car and couldn't analyze the problem, except for replacing the whole DAMN cooling system!!!! Obviously it would run fine after that!!!! I usually find the oil change coupons and go to the cheapest place for an oil change, but never again with these clowns. I little rule to live by with mechanics is find a little mom and pop shop where the owner is the head mechanic and yiou should be ok.We ordered a pizza and wings for pickup to tonight and were told it would be a half hour. My husband drove up to pick it up and they hadn't even started the order. They then told him it would take another half hour to make our order he left and we ordered elsewhere. This was our first time trying them out and I can't say I have any interest in going back.This place is terrible, the food is probably alright if they could, I don't know..maybe get their orders right!? But I wouldn't know. I haven't ordered there in months because they've messed up on my delivery order three times in the past, but my boyfriend insisted he wanted orange beef so I gave them one more try..I specifically asked for NOT SPICY..what do they give me? Food soaked in chile oil and red peppers..maybe it's the language barrier, or maybe they are just f*ing idiots?!i haven't been here in ages, but i'm sure much hasn't changed.  whoever said that they are over-priced must be from somewhere else because there prices are definitely low to average.  which is why there hasn't been a single incident when i haven't witnessed a bunch of over-served d-bags.  it takes a LOT for a bar to make me feel uncomfortable, but this one succeeded.  there are some great people that hang out there, but there are enough shady ones that it's just not worth it.  there are too many other dive bars in the area to ever go back here.I hate for my first official review to be a one star review but Macayo's really disappointed me last night. When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were. I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait. However, when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated. I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me, "not too long." We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began. 

Once we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however, she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo). So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours. 

After about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order. Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out. Seriously, 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out. And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce. We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out. So, after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait. Apparently, she couldn't have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time. 

I don't recommend going to Macayos. You might have better luck at any of the other 10 Mexican restaurants on Bell Road.Don't buy anything from here! Their cigars are dry. The " walk-in humidor" is sub par! I purchased a $35 dollar blazer torch lighter. After filling it with butane I discovered it had no spark, broken! I tried to return it six days latter with a receipt. The owners son became argumentative, loud, and rude. He said  they wouldn't return or replace it. No, and I mean NO customer service ! I wish I had read other reviews before buying anything from there. Seams like others had the same complaint. I'll be contacting the BBB and filling a complaint. Save your time and money, go to a real tobacco shop. 

Update: it's now closed.Kind of a bad vibe when you walk in....two old ladies that seem to guard the front counter area and refuse bathroom service to my 5 year old girl but they of course will go back and sit THEIR geriatric @ss on the toilet.. We had to go next door to subway even after paying for overpriced toys. The RC airplane guys are great and it has a stellar selection of models to build but again......The train guys are cool too.

but.....do not have have the store with stuffed animals, dolls horses and girlee stuff and then refuse to let a 5 year old use your bathroom. TERRIBLE business decision.
BTW...thank you to the kind people at subway for allowing my little girl to use the facilities. THEY....are actually in business. We bought sandwiches there to patronize them. Do NOT patronize these people until they can the two counter guards.

If you have a family...be sure and ask them if your kid can use the restroom as a matter of quality control and then TEAR IN to those two old bats as a matter of principle.Roaches on the bar? Kitchen closed at 10;15 PM? What happened to this place? YUCK!!!! Caught a roach on the bar and put it in a glass upside down. No apology, the barkeep just put it on the other side of the bar near other employees standing around talking!! The counter was dirty and there was trash on the floor and under all the counters!! Where is the health commission? I used to love this place but I can't drink and not eat. dui alley is right there and it's only 10:15!! Still very hungry sounds like bad management. Thank god off site betting keeps them alive but damn this place is filthy. They should be embarrassed but I will take my business back Mellow Mushroom where the kitchen is always open and the bar is cleanHORRIBLE ! HORRIBLE ! PLACE ! Very rude workers ! Especially the owner! I picked my dog up and the owner got mad at my dog for barking ! She started yelling at my dog in front of me then she pushed him and said "bad dog !" In front of me ! I will never go back here again. Who gets that mad at a dog?  Espically in front of there owners. Very disappointed. I was going to send two of my friends over. NOT ANYMORE! please ladies and gentlemen don't send you're loving animals to this torture !:*(I took my friend here tonight as a "thank you" for letting me stay with her for four days.  I thought with 57 reviews and a 4 star rating I couldn't go wrong.  I was wrong.  Every "roll" was a giant pre-made california roll topped with something else.  The Spicy Tuna Roll had chopped up tuna on top and was not spicy.  My friend had to ask for a spicy sauce to go with it and the waitress explained that "our spicy tuna isn't spicy".  The last straw was the salmon roll which was, again, a california roll topped with baked chopped salmon.  It was inedible.  I couldn't understand why there were so many customers there.  I wouldn't eat here again if it were free.  I wish I had really listened to Mar A.'s review.Um...Wow!  I don't think they have maid service in this dive of a hotel.  After checking in, I opened the blinds.  Filthy windows with lips, nose and tongue marks from what looked like children who stayed their before me.  Room reeked of something nasty like urine, mold and mildew all mixed together.  Went to use the bathroom and it's a good thing I didn't sit.  The man who stayed there before me had peed all over the seat and nobody bothered to clean it before giving the room to someone new.  

Went back to the lobby to get a new room.  At least the toilet was clean in this one.  But the sink had some dirty stains all over it from the last guest.  And their hairs were still in the shower which was apparently not cleaned.  All of the water cups in the room had holes in them and were unusable.  The bath towels were all different shades of stained dingy white covered in dirt and I had to borrow towels from the friends I was visiting.  Scared of the bed, so I slept with all of my clothes on.  Worst motel I have ever stayed in and definitely way over priced.This Jack's has been closed!  Thank goodness since we got food poisoning from this place!  YUCK!Not impressed. I had not been here in a while but remembered as much better than it was tonight.  As I sit here my stomach hurts. We ordered a turkey burger, it was dry and had an odd taste combined with the taste of char (which was dominating). My husband got a mushroom burger, the mushrooms were so weird (chopped into nothing, clearly from a can and a sick yellow color). My daughters kids burger was all char no flavor.  Very disappointing.  We left most of our food, when the waitress came over she could see by the looks on our face that it was not going over well, she never offered anything.  Usually when most of the food except one or 2 bites are still on the plate that might trigger some alarm bells.TO POTENTIAL STUDENTS:

DO NOT EVEN BOTHER LOOKING HERE IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ATTENDING BEAUTY SCHOOL!


Stuff the school does not mention to you at the time of enrollment:

- they PREFER you have at least SOME experience in what you are there to learn, in other words, newbies not apply

- Staff does not care who you are after you are enrolled, so do not expect any special treatment and/or caring staff members for any concerns you may have

- that kit that you pay for out of pocket, items will be used for practice and on customers if the school just simply cannot supply what is needed

- nail techs always run out of paper towels and acrylic, always

- its irritating and inconvenient to them if you have no one at home to practice on

- if its busy, you will run out of the proper equipment needed and be given a stool and a box to place your ass and supplies on while doing a pedicure

-while being taught how to do something, you will not be given any pointers on what you should work on to improve and the only response given to you by so called PROFESSIONAL and LICENSED cosmetologists / manicurists is pretty much, 'good enough.'

-unless you are enrolling with a friend, don't expect fellow students to try and help you out or BECOME your friend. SNOBBY SNOBBY SNOBBY!

-If you mess something up, or do not do it properly, both your fellow students AND staff, will make fun of you behind your back not bothering to give you pointers or any sort of helpful advice

- if you want someone to take any complaint you may have seriously, you have to threaten to drop out and get your money back. But even then, they go back to ignoring you as soon as they know you've given them a second chance

- Even if class picture day is 2 days after you enroll, You are expected to participate no matter how uncomfortable you are

- If the next competition is scheduled within the first week of you starting, you are expected to participate and be judged on your work. No matter how advanced or inexperienced you are. 

- Nail techs, cosmos and estheticians do not intermingle. They all talk poorly about each other.

- NO student actually LIKES attending here

- The only time you are noticed is when you don't show up for class, since that can be held against you

- Miss Tana is not a very well liked person, she has the mentality of a popular girl in high school and needs to knock it off with the 6 inch heels and low cut tops

- if you pay tuition in full you get less attention from the school. Only because they do not have to come after you at any point to get the rest of their money

-they do student appreciation day, and some foods served will be prepared in the sinks dirty foot water, acetone and other chemicals are poured into

- Miss idontknowhowtospellhername, the staff member you should be dealing with most, the staff member in charge of keeping you updated about your status, the staff member keeping track of your attendance and hours, is very unprofessional. Shes rude, often pisses students off, doesn't go out of her way to try and help you and VERY much should not be working with people

- you are expected to start working with the public after 100 hours (at least as a nail technician) no matter if you've practiced 1 mani / pedi or 5

- if you refuse to participate in required competions for any reason, you will be threatened suspension. Even if the reason is that you don't feel comfortable because you just started


I cannot stress to you how terrible this place was.
It was like being in high school again,
but everyone was over 18, some even over 50.

Staff often recommends to prospective students that the best way to get an idea of whether or not they should attend is to get a service done and talk to a current student about it. Don't bother. I can tell you right now that not one student was happy or excited to be there. If any of the students said otherwise, Its because an instructor or staff member was nearby.

The quality of work done by students was pathetic. For practicing state board so often, I was expecting some impressive work by at least SOME students. The only student I would have let do any practice on me was self taught for years and was only attending school to be licensed. Marinello was not responsible for teaching her any skills she had.

I think as a cosmetology school, they should ALWAYS be supplied with needed materials, especially since they are used on a daily basis. Constantly being out of Mortimer, Acrylic, Paper towels, pedicure chairs, and acetone is ridiculous. Its even MORE ridiculous that they expect you to use supplies in your kit which YOU pay for out of pocket.

On top of that, the Orkin man that sprays both at the school and at my work asked me why I wasn't attending, I told him I didn't like the program and the school itself was nasty and he replied 'well I could of told you that.'

Even the guy who sprays for bugs thinks this schools gross?
eww.This JCPenney isn't the greatest.  It really lacks selection and doesn't carry all the brands as other ones do.  It also doesn't carry Southpole shoes and the people that work here don't know what they are doing.After receiving a ridiculously rude private message on here last night it has been brought to my attention that the employees are required to wear BLUE SHIRTS. My error. I guess in my old age I am not only getting sun damage, but I am also becoming color blind. Lol. I'd still rather be color blind than work at Walmart. BOOM!!!!!!!I was so disappointed. I live on the other side of Vegas and going to Pei Wei was suppose to be a treat. But the veggies were old and wilted. My middle were mush. I won't be back. We got the pad Thai and orange beef. Both were terrible. The edename and crab wontons were good.Just horrible. After $9000 paid I was told my son needed braces again. They accused him of not wearing his retainer which he always did. And, then they said he needed braces for another $3k. After year of our last visit they are sending my son notices to come back. Well, let me see, it wasn't my son making the payments. I dont think we will be back without an attorney so I can get some of my money back and get my son's teeth fixed correctly.HOTEL. STAFF. CROWD.

Purchased a room, bought bottle service, and gave more than enough money away to this place - only to be pushed out the hotel/club by some chump bouncer (with all my money, I.D., & personal belongings still in my room)  because I had taken the stairwell and came in from the back patio. Not having any idea, since I had only been there for less than an hour, apparently the patio was closed off for matienence. As I scream at the guy, waving my hotel key around, asking him what was going on over the loud music, he merely pushed me out the hotel and had me wait for another staff member to tell me it was okay to go back inside - NO SHIT! 

Stay far away from this place. Careless drunk fools who wouldn't give a damn if they just knocked your $10 drink out of your hand. And very rude staff who refuse to listen or be apologetic.First off, I want to be clear. This rating is for the horrible customer service we experienced. 

I came with a party of 3 and we stayed here due to the inflated prices from the iHeart Radio festival. We didn't mind it being off the strip and it's "supposed" to be a boutique hotel. 

Everything was great for the first night. The next morning, we left around 10:30 AM and made sure to take off the Do Not Disturb sign and when we came back around 7:30 PM we found our room not yet serviced. Clearly we were forgotten. We called the front desk and was put on hold several times. Eventually we got through and we told the front desk receptionist that we our room was not serviced. To which she replies, with no apology, "oh, okay." Ridiculous. Anyway, we were not in the mood to argue and we asked for clean towels. 1 hour later, still no towels. Basically, one of us had to shower and with no clean towels. We eventually picked up the towels from the receptionist later in the evening.

What takes the icing off the cake and what inadvertently allowed us to decide to never come back was the horrible gatekeeper/ bouncer for the after hours club. We came back to the hotel (with a room key clearly visible in our hands) and was basically verbally assaulted by the bouncer. As if stating we were staying in the hotel with a key and letting him know which room number we were in was not enough, he wanted our names. Seriously? His reply: "YES, SERIOUSLY". What's up with the attitude? Get over yourself. 

Pros: cheap prices, not far from strip.
Cons: Loud after hours party (below on lobby level), no house keeping, lack of taxi access, no organization of entire hotel, and the worst customer service you will encounter.

Don't waste your time here. They lost more than just three customers. We are going to tell everyone we know to not stay here.Located in a cute Asian town I never knew existed! Pho time! Full of Asians in here! (Quick tip from cell)

After eating here: This place is super sub-par! I'm so sad! I got the chicken pho & @ first glance, it lacked EVERYTHING. I guess l get too spoiled living in Orange County, California with quality fresh cheap authentic pho on every corner.

They skimped on ALL veggies especially scallions, culantro, thai basil, & white onion. Broth was below average. At least I had the option to choose big rice noodles after I requested it. The measly dry chicken BITS were floating around in the murky water. At other places, when you order chicken pho, these are the questions the waiter would ask you (but this place didn't):

-What bowl size?
-What noodle size?
-White or dark meat?
-Do you want chicken skin on your meat?
-Do you want gizzards? (Liver, Coagulated blood, heart, eggs, etc.)

HOISIN SAUCE!!! Watered down, much? It was runny, light brown, and extra salty-like a teriyaki sauce! How can you even manage to eff that up too? Wow...

Opt for elsewhere, please. We made the mistake of choosing that place because later after some driving around, we saw plenty of other pho restaurants on the same street. Cheaper too, albeit. Darnit-we originally were supposed to eat @ Kinh Do because they supposedly have better reviews...I have tried to go here twice and each time i had to wait a long time, she said 1 hour so i said fine i will wait, i wanted a full set and low lights in my hair and i waited and waited and she finally tells me after an hour of waiting, i cant do your hair its too dark & she said she had a lady coming in to get her hair done for a wedding..so i waited forever & just wasted my time.I took my family here on Valentine's Day. What a disaster! The 45-minute wait was to be expected given that it was Feb. 14, but the hour-long wait to get our food wasn't. Plus, the food was terrible. The clam chowder had some weird spice in it and was congealed. Ick! The burger had a soggy bottom bun. The lobster bisque was gross. It tasted like butter and cream with very little lobster. The only thing I liked was the wedge salad (but it's hard to mess up a chunk of lettuce sprinkled with bacon, blue cheese and tomatoes.) We were all disappointed and will never go back.Poor service (repeated my order three times and it was still wrong), loud music (probably the reason the girl could not hear me and got the order wrong), wrong change (even after I pointed it out, they did not correct it, the cashier walked away), no selection (no pastrami, no swiss, cheddar, only provolone, etc). Why would anyone want to eat here?The first time we ate there was so good. we planned next trip especially to eat there. However, the second time the food was gross. It was so bad we never ate there again. It's true, it depends on the chef. I have little to say about this place, I was disappointed.Beef taco ok.quesedilla..had me sick as shitAn obvious trap for the non cigar smoker; a poor assortment of third party(that is to say,
established and known cigar brand) and a heavy sales push towards their overpriced in house branded cigars of dubious quality. 

Their lounge is fairly simplistic and is located right at entrance of the shop - meaning no privacy during business conversations nor any peace and quiet away from the hustle and bustle of the front register and the shops sales pitches. 

They sell an abnormal amount of soft apparel with the aim towards the witless tourist that wants to pay to advertise that he paid $12 for one of their in house branded cigars. Any of the sort apparel that you might buy(tshirts, cape, soft pants(?!?)) will have been stored right next to the minute smoking lounge area, meaning that even a hardcore cigar smoker will balk at packing anything from there down in his luggage before he heads to the next convention. 

The store personnel(owner?) was geared only towards selling their own branded stock with no convincing pitch or notion of what the smoker was used to or wanted - this said stock stated at about $9 and topped out at around $12 plus tax. A bit steep for an untried card, especially when you have, although a poor selection, some known brand for the same, if not less, amount to choose from. 

On the whole, a lacklustering experience that does not stand to be repeated.A complete waste of time and money. This place is nothing but a brick-and-mortar insurance scam. My experience was the worst health-care experience of my life, and I've seen some pretty bad ones. I waited in the waiting room for 12 hours.  All they did was draw some blood and told me it would probably be another hour or two. After the 14th hour, I walked out and found a real doctor the next morning with a real prescription pad.

My advice: if you have a medical emergency, stay away from UMC, unless you want an appointment with death.To start off with we came in we were seated promptly, a few moments later our drink orders were taken.  Roughly five minutes later our drinks finally come with some chips and salsa.  I had already started to get a bad feeling about this visit.  The waitress asked my wife to taste her diet pepsi to make sure it was right, however she did not wait around for the answer.  Her diet pepsi was flat.  A few minutes go by and she finally comes to take our order, we place our order and she leaves again.  My drink became empty during the wait and she finally noticed about 10 minutes later.  It took them nearly 25 minutes to get our food to us, of course what would happen?  They brought me the wrong food.  In typical fashion with this type of waitress she fled the scene before I realized that I had the wrong food, I was fuming that it was taking so long, no other place in town has ever been so slow in food delivery for a lunch menu!  It took her 12 minutes from the time she delivered her food to the time she came to ask how everything was.  I was finally able to tell her about our problems.  She offered to correct my meal but I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes so I told her not to worry about it.  She left promptly and about five minutes go by and she apologized for the mixup and asked again if I wanted my corrected order to go this time, again I said no and she started to collect our plates and left, to which I would have imagined she knew we were ready to go, another seven minutes go by before she brings us the check.  All in all it took us roughly an hour from start to finish, definitely not great lunch service.  She said she was going to correct the bill so we didn't have to pay for the wrong stuff, she took $1 off for my meal being wrong, how nice.  When I spoke to the cashier I was able to get the flat soda removed.  I'm a tipper, for excellent service I have tipped up to 50% before, rarely do I tip below 20% for decent service just because I know how hard these people work.  This is the first time in nearly ten years that I did not leave a tip.  We will not be going back to this location.  For lunch hours with not too many patrons you wouldn't imagine it would have sucked this bad.I like to venture out w diff. types of food once in awhile so I wanted to give this place a try with a Groupon offer. Total disappointment. First of all, its location...sucks! Secondly, unprofessional staffs busy eating and talking...sucks! And lastly, very-dried-up-NO-flavor-over-fried food...major sucks!I went with my husband and ordered a dish with hotness of a 6 out of 10. I understand Thai food is hot, but this food was unbelievably hot. I couldn't even eat my food. When the server asked how everything was I told her it was too hot for me. She did absolutely nothing but moved on. I've worked in restaurants for over 25 years and the first thing I do is make is make sure everything perfect for the guest, especially if it's not. So, my lunch of rice was good. Would I go back? Not anymore because of customer service.The service I got here was terrible. I went to this all u can eat sushi cause It has good reviews but I was wrong... The waitress was rude didnt explain the menu and not everything is on it. The sushi chef had no clue what he was doing and couldnt give us suggestions. When the waitress stated not everything is on the menu so ask the chef...I've eaten here a number of times and the food is average, but the service has been pretty good each time. This is a chain and they do not care one bit about the staff - didnt they even go so far as to say because of Obamacare they will cut back on staff hours so they don't have to provide health insurance?  Because of their treatment of Chelsea the fired waitress and way they treat their employees, I will never go to an Applebee's again.This place operates like providing poor service and doing so with a bad attitude are respectively rules 1 and 2 in their employee conduct guide. It is at least nice to know i am not the only person to suffer this joke of a company's treatment.

Dear dispatchers*: "Please do everyone a favor and get caught violating your parole ASAP. You are absolutely not fit to interact outside of prison walls."

*Technically, i may be wrong calling you 'dispatcher'...i suspect at least one of you is also the owner-manager.
**With that said, it is quite safe to assume that the owner-manager is minimally a registered felon and more likely a full-on psychopath.Really awful experience with this company. First, they left very valuable veneer out in the rain and it was damaged beyond use. Then, upon re-order, they did not even check to see that the new product was cracked beyond repair. I've been trying to get a refund due to me for 3 weeks. I expected so much more. Will never give them my business or any referrals again.I'm giving them ZERO stars for their overall service went in to sign a new contract with Sprint & get 3 EVO 4G phones. They (including the asst. manager who signed us up) told me that Sprint is no longer making those phone because of issues and that we could get the new EVO 4G Design for the same price. I reluctantly got 3, but they only had 2 in stock so I paid overnight shipping for the 3rd. I didn't get the 3rd until 3 days later & called them everyday to find out if the phone came in. When I asked about a refund for the shipping difference, the asst. manager said they were unable to do refunds & I would get it on my mail-in rebate which he forgot to give us when we signed our contracts and I had to remind him about. When I called Sprint to inquire about that, they said the store should have refunded me & I would NOT see it on my rebate. Since we have had the phones, they black out during calls & you cannot hang up 3-4 times a Faythe only way to get your phone back on is to take the battery out. When I called Sprint about it, they said they are still making the EVO 4G & that there are no none problems with it. I am so disappointed that the asst. manager at this store told lie after lie! Now I have to take all 3 phones in to another store to have them "troubleshoot" what could be going on. To top it all off, they were unable to migrate our phonebooks on our old phones for 2 of them. They also would not import over our photos from the old phones and said if we wanted to do that, we would need to drop all the phones off with them & leave them there for a few hours. It's funny because Best Buy can do it in minutes. And lastly, I asked them if they would cancel our account on our old carrier & the asst. manager said no problem. After 4 days of our old phones being still on, I called the store back & the asst. manager told me I would need to call our old carrier & do it & that he got "confused". Who would make such a moron an asst. manager is beyond me. Although he was nice, he obviously had no idea what he was doing. Just goes to show that no matter how nice you are, if you have no idea what you are doing, then it doesn't matter. DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE!!Fails Fargo,  keep your cash in your mattress!I went in for first time end of dec and I'm still trying to get the catastrophic  event behind me. Dropped off $200 brand new shirt end of dec.  Picked up shirt for New Years Eve. There are gold braided chains across empire waist. One side of the chains had been pulled out, completely obvious. They just packaged it anyway. I told them they would fix it like it was when brought in. A week later I pick it up and it looks like a 5 yr old fixed it! I can't get past the unprofessional manager to talk to owner to resolve this  problem . Shes too busy to handle a very bad service her company provided. She was very unknowledgeable about every aspect of my problem, but was sure about 1 thing, she had to handle it herself and it would be tues before she could even call to discuss problem with owner. It was 12:00 pm on a friday. I would never recommend this business to anyone. Cross your fingers they finally get it right! Amazing one shirt can spend a month at the cleaners! Woolite here I come!I just moved to Las Vegas with my two daughters and two boxers.  A few months later after we moved, one of my boxers had bad allergies, and I took her in to see what could be done.  Upon seeing her, doctor gave us six different medications that cost $500; what was worse though was she gave the wrong dosing amount that made my boxer act like she was in a coma.  (thank god she said it was a strong medication and to keep an eye on her)  When I called to relate what was happening, all she said was "oh $h^T" and that the lables instructions were wrong.The night crew tonight wasn't so great. Food took a while for the car ahead of us as well as our order. They also gave us the wrong order. Looked in the window n there was about 5 of them standing around talking story. No wonder our order was incorrect. The food they gave us was also cheaper then the ones ordered. :( fail on the night manager.I came in early enough to drop off my medication at the Walgreens pharmacy they told me it would be 20 minutes to get the refill so I waited I waited I waited and I never heard my name be called so all of a sudden it was 6:05 p.m. The entire pharmacy was closed I went up to the front and I spoke to the supervisor there I forgot her name she has long curly hair she wears glasses for haiair color is blondish brown she's Hispanic and I told her to call back there and get someone because my prescriptions are there she did not want to call back to refuse to help me and then I had to keep asking her to please call back after I need my prescriptions pharmacist came up to the front he was able to give me my prescriptions ring me up and I was on my way so I had to call back the next day and report her to her manager and that was a waste of my time because she should have known that she could have helped me by simply just calling the pharmacist like I had to keep asking her to do I would not suggest the store to anyoneI got food poisoning here just a couple of days ago when I was here for New Years. Maybe we sat across each other and didn't even know it, Kallie. I had the hot breaded wings with ranch and a vodka/ cranberry. The service was non-existent and/or cranky--I was never asked for a refill. However, I refilled the toilet several times New Years Eve thanks to Hooters.Worst food I've had this year! Even for a bar / restaurant I would expect more. Greasy tasteless stale food.Sooooo slow. Super dated, food was OK, thought this would be a holy grail Hooters to visit. Now I relaize there is a reason its at the end of the strip and not in the middle.Badger only gets a 1 because I can't give them anything less. We booked them for a flight to the airport, and they said they would pick us up in 15 minutes. When they hadn't arrived 20 minutes later, we gave them a call, and they said they were still 10 minutes away. When they hadn't arrived 15 minutes later, we gave up and called another company. Would have had better luck taking a real to the airport!Just stopped in with family to enjoy Saturday afternoon meal with Living Social deal. First-other couple with is had own separate deal, and waitress wouldn't allow us to sit together with separate bills. The waitress acted like I she didn't need any tip, answering with 1 words and acting cocky. Then after throwing a fit, she came back and told us that Living Social made "a mistake and 20% was auto added to bill". A lie. When I asked "Manager" about it, he called out that there was an event across the street and they didn't even have to allow the deals. Btw, 3 other people in the place. 

How dumb of this place to lose my business as well as the other 50 people I will tell about this. Can't believe that they think they can treat families this way and still stay profitable. Unfortunately, I will make up for that 20% faster than they will. College dropouts running grills don't work, Owners!!!!I had made an appointment with a skin doctor to get some warts removed. I went to the clinic on Park Street got it done. Then I got my bill for my $45 co-pay. No problem right, until I made another appointment. The doctor that I had seen before was no longer with the UW Health system. So the lady who made my appointment made it with a different doctor at the West clinic on Junction Rd. Went there and got it done but now I get two different bills. One for $220 some dollars and another for $140 some dollars. Come to find out that the West Clinic on Junction Rd is apparently affiliated with the UW Hospital and they have to bill my simple wart removal as an Out Patient Surgery and not an Office Visit. So I got stuck with this larger than expected bill. I would suggest to anyone making an appointment with the UW Health System NOT TO or you may get ripped off like I did.I had my son's birthday party at the waterpark in the hotel.  They advertise this service, and even offer coupons from time to time.  I was not very happy with the whole process from start to finish.  There are too many ridiculous rules.  For one thing, I think it's good business to honor coupons that are presented, whether or not they are expired--the purpose is to attract business, right?  Then we need to bring in our own cake, which is fine, but you can't say we NEED to bring one type of food item, and then BAN other food items.  I brought some chips and crackers to the party room.  Then I was told (after I already set everything up) that we couldn't have snacks in the party room.  Or drinks.  Would YOU like to attend a party with no snacks or drinks?  So then I got to trudge back and forth to the room, moving food and carrying by wet, wailing toddler.  Fun.  Also the times available were not what I would have chosen--sunday evening is not the best time.  But since it was so late, I thought it would be nice to have beer for the adults.  SURPRISE that wasn't allowed either!  The bar was closed so we couldn't even purchase beer if we wanted to (unless we wanted to get dressed, walk to the lobby, again carrying wet children).
There were facility problems too.  The party room smelled horrible, like rotten sweatsocks and underwear.  Who wants to eat in a room that smells like ass?  I don't know if it was the chairs or the filthy carpet or what.  Also, some of the kids wanted to swim around 7 PM, and most of the lights were off in the pool area.  This is very unsafe--I could barely see my toddler.
Although the woman serving was very nice, it's clear the whole purpose of these rules are to try to force you to buy more things and spend more money.  I will NOT be having another party here!  If I'm renting a room for a few hours to have a party, I expect to be able to eat and drink whatever I want.I am just shocked!  I took this same dress in to be cleaned again after I wore it, and my experience this time was the exact opposite of the first!  To begin with, I was charged $3 more this time - for the exact same item.  I questioned it, and was told they obviously charged me incorrectly the first time.  I wasn't happy about it, but what could I do.  I paid and took my dress out to the car, and as I was putting it in the car, I noticed a dark "x" shaped stain on the bottom of the dress, about the size of a quarter.  This stain was NOT there when I took it in - I had inspected the entire dress thoroughly so I could point out any stains it did have (there had been some water type stains in the middle front, and a small dark dot towards the bottom).  Upon looking further, the small dot stain was gone, but the water stains were still there.  The dress also did not have that same sparkling brand new appearance to the fabric it had when they cleaned it the week before.  I took it back inside and pointed out the non-removed stain and the dark x one that hadn't been there before.  The woman said they would try to get it out and I could pick it up on Friday.  I left, and had been gone no longer than 5 minutes when I received a call from them.  A man left a message, stating the dress is not getting any better, he tried to clean it and it doesn't come out, they can clean it 15 more times and it won't make a difference.  They aren't going to do it again!  His tone implied annoyance at me, acting like I was unreasonable to even ask that they remove the stain that happened at their facility!  I am having a very hard time believing this is the same place that I took my dress to the first time!  Before, they were able to remove the large seven year old stain, and I was told I was lucky because that part of the dress was polyester fabric, which cleans well.  So how is that same fabric now impossible to clean?  I am beyond upset at their service and attitude this time.  

What a shame, considering my husband just started a new job that requires he wear shirts/ties/dress pants every day, and we are in need of a reliable dry cleaner!  I will have to keep looking, as I will certainly not be going back to Right Touch!So, I fly a lot., nearly 70,000 miles in the past 6 months. Not usually US Airways/America West - only maybe 5 or 6 times with them. But my ONLY horrible airline experiences have both been with them., which is quite a ratio.

1. Flew from San Diego to Portland meeting up for a month-long concert tour. I had  my personal things as well as music/sound equipment. Of course, when I land, my luggage didn't. After spending at least an hour trying to get baggage services to help me - they say my luggage is on the next flight, and they will have a courier deliver it to me. I make abundantly clear that I will meet the courier and have it personally handed to me - I don't want it left with security/staff/anyone else (we were at a large rock venue).  They promised to call as soon as my luggage landed, and again when the courier was en route and they would only deliver to me personally.

Of course, no call. And I called every hour on the hour till 4 in the morning (when we left for the next city on the tour) - and couldn't get an answer or a call back. Not only did they not call me as promised, OR return any my calls, they apparently DID deliver my bags, but just left them on the door of the venue - EXACTLY what I had stressed not to do. I found this out the next day after calling repeatedly - when we were already in another city. Nobody signed for them even. Never saw my bags again, lost a ton of important gear I needed for work, and was screwed. And then? A HUGE a huge fight with them over the claim. They dishonored the claim for a while since they said they delivered them to the address I specified - despite having a promise in writing to deliver to me by hand. Then they said my claim was with the courier company, not the airline.Then they didn't want to cover anything but clothing and hygiene items.

2. Flew from St. Louis to Flagstaff. Had a layover in Phoenix - which is only like a 2 hour drive from Flagstaff. The flight in Phoenix was delayed several hours - but they didn't announce the delay until 10 minutes to boarding - and kept delaying it by just 20 minutes at a time. Finally, once we board we are told the flight MAY be not be able to land in Flagstaff due to bad weather. The kicker? They won't send us back to Phoenix - we would be diverted to Palm Springs California - and since it was "an act of god" - we were on our own. They weren't responsible for lodging, return airfare, refunds, ground transport - nothing. So - the whole plane is already pissed about being delayed so long, and now this. Nobody wants to take the chance of being flown to another state and getting stuck - so literally all but maybe 2 people deplane and mill around the tarmack. 

Then we  find out that we can choose not to take the flight, but if we checked baggage - we can't retrieve it! It's going to either Flagstaff or Palm Springs with or without us!  So some people start to get back on the plane, and others are arguing on the tarmack about what to do about their bags. I spot our bags just sitting in the open cargo door of the plane, and lead a small army of angry passengers to the back of the plane and  we just grab our bags that were in plain sight. The flight attendant tried to stop us - but realized that people were pissed, and we greatly outnumbered them. 

I ended up just renting  a car and driving the 2 hours to Flagstaff. And apparently flights to Flagstaff had been cancelled all day - but they neglected to tell us that.  At least they could have given a heads-up to us so that we could have not waited nearly 4 hours on flight delays and driven ourselves there much faster. No apologies, no refunds, nothing. 

I primarily fly either United, Southwest, or Jet Blue. No horror stories from them - while yes they've lost a bag here or there, they've always been professional and prompt in getting it to me.While the desk guy Peter in Santa Barbara was amazingly helpful the rest of the experience sucked. Flights late on the way in. Flight canceled on the way out and I had to find my own way to a different airport to get home.When this place first opened, it was the talk of the town.  Finally, a cool, urban-like restaurant in central Phoenix!  I went there a few times with friends and at the beginning we just thought that they needed to work the bugs out, and so we gave them a second chance and another second chance and another second chance.

The kicker for me was when I went there alone after work.  Dining alone can be a very frustrating experience in Phoenix; I guess the waiters see the same amount of work for one person as if three were at a table but for less of a tip.  Here at My Florist, though, the service for this single gal bordered on rudeness.  On this one night alone after work I walked in and just stood there.  It was a good 5 to 10 minutes before I flagged down someone to talk to.  There were a few empty tables (ie, they were not slammed), but I asked to sit at the bar.  There were two empty chairs at the bar with dirty plates in front of them.  The person escorted me over to one of the bar chairs and kind of dumped me off there.  I asked the person behind the bar politely if he could clean off the space for me and then he disappeared.  I stood there, alone, waiting, and then I just left.  I knew that no one even noticed or cared that I had been there or that I had left.  It was a sad feeling.  It was probably the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant with regard to service and just human courtesy.  

No more second chances.Really come on people, I had a thin dry ass over cooked bland hamburger and some undercooked cold fries. Nasty. I won't be going back. Price was right taste was wrong. The biker atmosphere and poorly prepared burgers will make sure i wont be going back.Horrible. Fish is not seasoned, has zero flavor. the "shrimp" is a joke its like 85% breading. and the fries are basic frozen from your grocers freezer.

only an Arizonan who hasn't  been exposed to much outside of the desert would tell you they like this place. your better off at long john silver at least the seafood is recognizable. 

i will say that the dipping sauce for the fish is great, but as far as the actual food goes this might be the worst resturant I've ever eaten at.Your typical overpriced art retail store staffed with minimum wage high school or college art students sporting ear gauges, pink hair, and facial piercings. What does that mean? Don't expect anything more than average customer service with ridiculously high prices.

Check this out: I paid $4.69 for a product that I can buy for a $1.08 online. Literally. I only purchased because it was time sensitive and I needed it immediately. If you can wait a few extra days for shipping and have an Internet connection avoid this store I guarantee you can find much lower prices elsewhere.Worst business ethics I have ever seen. No wonder they bar the place up, they are crooks! Went in with an limited edition Ford watch. They pulled one up on there computer that was not even close to the watch I brought in tring to compare prices. The reason they could not find the one I have is because of its rarity. The employees have no knowledge of anything, and are very sloppy with no customer service. The "boss"  Insulted me with a useless offer, would not even look me in the face and walked away in middle of conversation.  Something shady is a foot. Bottom line I got out of the geto and got $250 more then what they offered. Just pass this place and move on. To the manager just because someone is tring to sell something does not make them desperate, maybe if i had boobs you would have talked to me.This place blew on every level of suckness. I ended up in this dump because of a welcome home party for someone I indirectly knew. First, the waitress was as dumb as rocks. She kept coming back & telling us they were out of 9/10 beers on tap. 30 min later we got our room temperature pitcher. Secondly, I ordered cheese sticks & then waited 45m for some steaming pile of crap. The cheese sticks were way over cooked with the cheese pouring every where and there was some strange black substance covering them. Thirdly, when our waitress finally came back and informed us of our tabs, she over charged all of us, and never brought back our change. Then continued to come around once in a while and try to convince us we needed to pay for our tabs. I was hoping this would be a chill place to hang out and play pool but instead it's the epitome of low rent. Stay away if you want to hang on to your cash.-GO TO SWEET TOMATOES INSTEAD- The restaurant was below average... Cheap but not worth $6. The stations were messy and they were short staffed. The day we came I (3/17/14) they had an issue with the stoves and so we had a choice of corn bread or sweet potatoes for hot foods. I understand that it's not their fault the kitchen wasn't working but they should have let us know before we paid!I was so very disappointed. My experience with mongolian bbq has always been great - lots of fresh choices, cooked and chopped on a sizzling griddle, then piled high, piping hot in a bowl.

YC's was the antithesis of this experience. Old, bland ingredients, limited choices, no broad array of sauces and spices to spruce up your bowl with. I couldn't even bring myself to finish one bowl.

To make matters worse, the place has all the atmosphere of a warehouse.Ive been going here on/off for as long as this place has been open. I always went for the self service especially the engine degreaser. It USED to be a potent bright green detergent that worked. Until the other day that is. I went in put $5 in the machine and turned on the degreaser, wow only a very pale tint green, smelled more like water, almost no soap. I asked the guy working to check on it, he said it was working, quote " look there's product in there". Which I replied not enough to clean anything. 

so lost my $5, could clean my engine, won't be going back here again.If I could give it zero stars I would!  This isn't the friendliest place in town.  Sure, it was close to our house but never again will I set foot in this nasty place.  Our first interaction with the owner was him making fun of Americans, that was why they have the "diner special" posted all over the restaurant.   I felt very uncomfortable the second I walked in there.  It felt as if he just saw dollar signs when he would glance at my wife and I.  


On to the food.... Horrible, just horrible, I ordered the Shrimp Lo-mein.  To my surprise the food came out really quick!  The second he put the plate of hot mess in front of my face the smell almost started my gag reflex. Now I knew why it had come so fast.  The mixture of noodle, canned mushrooms, cabbage, snow peas, bamboo shoots and whatever else they had thrown in the mix with the shrimp all had burn marks on them.  It looked like they had only stirred the mixture only once, then let the one side just sit in the pan until they smelt it burn, ding, the timer was done.

 The smell of burnt food actually ended up being the taste of the whole meal!  Now, I am one who will have the waiter take back the plate of food if it is not up to eatable standards but in this case I didn't want to have to fight with this guy about how horrible this plate of crap was.  I nibbled on what looked eatable then we quickly packed our left overs, paid and left, the closes garbage can we found we threw the food away.

I'm not quite sure why or if we ordered the right thing but I can't figure out why this place is getting highish reviews on Yelp.  How this place is still open in that matter.  I say turn around and run from this place.  Go try a different hole in the wall.I am a former resident who lived at the apartment complex for nearly 3 years.  I had a great experience up until the new property manager, Josh took over the complex.  Not only did my apartment door get kicked down and my apartment get complete robbed under his watch.  But, he never once followed-up with me to make sure I was okay.  Upon my giving notification that I was breaking my lease with them because I felt my safety was an issue, Josh then told me that what happened wasn't his fault and that he would be charging me 1.5 times my rent.  I told him good luck collecting that from me, and that I would only pay the money owed for any days I occupy the apartment.  I was then sent a statement of deposit upon which I was told that the $375 of nonrefundable deposits I payed when I moved in were strictly "apartment prepping" and "administrative" fees and aren't deducted from the cleaning/painting fees used to prep the apartment for the next renter.  I told them that contradicts what they just told me because they said that the money was used to prep the apartment.  Anyways, I am stuck with an additional $600 to pay them because they turned what was a really enjoyable living situation into a complete nightmare.  I wouldn't recommend living in this place.  There are much nicer complexes and neighborhoods to live in, and you won't have to deal with an unethical staff who lacks any sort of customer service skills.After years of hearing friends rave about this infamous ice cream parlor, me and my boyfriend decided to go there for a date. Upon entering the restaurant, we both were met with a less than pleasant greeting. The restaurant had a very "stale" vibe... Nobody was smiling- customers and staff included. It was pretty busy which we had expected because it is a popular place, especially on a Saturday afternoon. After being seated, we noticed how dirty everything felt... Flies everywhere, sticky menus, sticky table, water glasses looked cloudy, etc. We were served quickly- my boyfriend ordered a vanilla sundae with cherry sauce and chocolate marshmallows sauce- his ice cream arrived as if it were soup. The few bites of solid ice cream were freezer burned. My sundae was fine, but nothing I couldn't have made at home. While we were waiting for our check, we joked about how the place felt haunted. I can't express how eery and unhappy the whole place seemed. Nobody seemed happy to be there. I went on Yelp while sitting there to read reviews because I was appalled at how horrible the place was. I wish I had checked BEFORE we had made the drive from the west valley. When we went to the cashier, the manager rung us up. He didn't look up once or say ONE word. Nothing. Basically, we will never go there again and will never recommend this place.If this place doesn't serve as a case study of what "wasted opportunity" and "terrible management" looks like, then show me another place like Sugar Daddy's that frighteningly resembles Chernobyl 1986.

I chuckle now because several times, years ago, I would wait in a line to get into this place -- not on my own accord, mind you -- but because some of my buddies thought this place was the killer.  In fact, this place would be freaking AWESOME if it was plopped down on 3rd Street and Roosevelt.  But it had two major things working against it: 1) Their kickarse patio faces the lame part of Scottsdale Road, and 2) Their kickarse property is in the lame part of Scottsdale Road.

Granted, I still wouldn't go if this place was set in Old Town, but at least they wouldn't be gasping for air while the distant, populated beach of Goldwater shrugs a casual shoulder.

This place just takes 'whats wrong with the Scottsdale bar scene' to another level.  They actually started this genus of bars and moved it further along the street to Loco Patron, which, conveniently enough for those vertical-striped sharks without a tank, is the slightly less crippled version of Sugar Daddy's.I concur with several other customers commenting on the owner. We frequented this restaurant for years however once we saw the other side of the owner, that was it for us.  Unpleasant and Rude is an understatment. It's not the way we want to spend a nice evening.I read a lot of great reviews so we tried it. I was not impressed.

This is definitely an older crowd (50+) and it seems they cater to that crowd. The food was small portions for the high cost, and the flavors were not all that great. The sweet breads were chopped up and drowned in sauce so you could barely taste the breads. I did not even think they were what we ordered.

I would not spend my money here, especially at their prices.Terrible.  My wife and I went there early afternoon on Thursday.

First, the counter attendant commits the ultimate faux pas:

"Are you together?"

Well duh, it's 2010.  Two wedding bands, my wife has lineage from Germany and Sweden and me, somewhere in N. Africa, but at least greet me before telling me that my wife of 10 years and I don't look like a couple.

Next, the food was miserable.

I had an "Orange Peel Beef" and the dish felt like someone breaded beef jerky, fried it hard and poured a bottle of mystery sauce over it.  All of the chili sauce at Pei Wei's couldn't save the dish.   Any vegetables in the dish had the consistency of something unpacked out of the freezer and dumped right in the deep fat fryer.  

Again, I ask myself, why in the world can't we get at least basically edible Chinese in Arizona?

My wife, or colleague as the front counter attendant assumed, ordered some chicken dish.

Again, over-breaded, had the taste and consistency of an order of McDonalds McNuggets drenched in a tub of sweet 'n sour sauce and poured over white rice.

This was literally the first time we went back to our home and dug out leftovers after spending almost $30 on lunch.  

Literally, my best experience about our meal at Pei Wei was the drive home.  Three of three strikes, shame on us for giving it another shot.

Pei Wei was awesome about three years ago, but now it's to the level of Paradise Valley Mall food court and that sucks.  This place needs an enormous amount of customer service training and at least a weekend "food stand-down" and retraining of the chef's.

I was HEAVILY disappointed.  Again.This place is really bad.  Not sure how you can have such bad service when its so empty but they pulled it off.

The food made me sick.  I am sure there are no stray dogs or cats in the area because the pork I had tasted like something totally different

Will not be back here.  What a waste of a mealDo not move here.

I repeat, DO NOT MOVE HERE!!!!

Leasing office staff is great/nice.  Not so helpful, but nice.

Management, unresponsive, uninformed, unhelpful (I am being polite).

If you are idiotic enough to be sucked into living here, live on the 2nd floor.  When I have mentioned to the leasing office about the noise, their response has been "just try to make friends with them" or "that is just the way the buildings are constructed."

Fireplace units do not have the chimneys cleaned.

Dead roach in the kitchen upon move in.

Carpet/pad so thin that you quickly and painfully learn to avoid stepping where there are tack strips.  

Multiple safety concerns: homeless, attempted break-ins, theft of rent checks, lighting not maintained/replaced, holes in the ground (where there is a water overflow or whatever pipe) has not had a lid on it for months.  Management has been made aware on several occassions -- still not fixed. 

Oh, and with regard to the burglaries and break-ins.....the management does not inform the tenants.  At all.  Never.  Ever.  So you may never know that your upstairs neighbors had an attempted break in (when you were home).

Maintenance appointments not kept -- and they do not typically leave notes when they do enter your apartment (even though they are supposed to).

No package service -- website says they will accept packages.

And if you ask about the "pre-wired for security" they have no idea what you are talking about.

Do not forget the FBR open....I work at Keirland Commons area -- during the FBR my commute was at least 35 minutes....no kidding.

Do not rent here.  The apartments have great floor plans, lots of grass, prices are good for the area so it is easy to think you found a great deal.  You did not.  Not worth the price unless you are a homebound deaf individual.

Good luck.First off my dog got cherry eye which is very easy to tell based off google... The vet told me it was an infection... Wrong... Wasted 115$ first visit on stupid drops that did not work, went again and spent the same amount for another kind of drops that do not work, I'm sure any other vet could of told me if they got it in one eye, they can easily get it in the other and look out for it, he did not and now my baby has 2 cherry eyes... He could of easily told me to get lubricant eye drops and massage back into place, he did not because I'm sure he wanted me to come back in and drop mad money on surgery, google your stuff this guy says... Nice people though, that's all the good that has came out from themThis place has gone way down hill lately!

I've been going to DeFalco's for almost seven years and I can't say I'll ever go back after my recent experience...

My friend and I stopped in on the afternoon of April 8th to get some food. From start to finish, the customer service was offensive. The man taking our order never made eye contact, never thanked us, and seemed to be more annoyed than anything.

After about 20 minutes of waiting for our food, one of the servers came out to the patio where we were sitting and called out my number. Again, this guy seemed almost to the point of being openly angry with me for no apparent reason. He brought out my dish, slammed it down on the table along with my silverware, and stormed back inside.

After five or so minutes of waiting for my friend's food, he went inside to ask for it. When he got inside he discovered his food had been sitting on the take out counter when he had in fact ordered it for dine in. When he checked it to make sure it was what he had ordered, he found that the order was not correct. When he asked to have it fixed, the manager on duty questioned him several times as if my friend was the one who had made the mistake. Again, this guy seemed angered by our presence. He proceeded to shout back at the cooks to fix the meal who then shouted back at him. A few minutes later, the same angry server brought our food out to the patio where I had been sitting and eating by myself.

The only saving grace was that the food still tasted good. However, I will DEFINITELY NOT BE GOING BACK to this place as long as the customers get treated the way we were treated that day.For the past year or so I have been getting flyers for Gus's Pizza plastered on my door like bad graffiti, and while the specials looked good, I never had a need to order pizza often, usually one of my friends would order from Domino's. This past week however, my friend and I were hungry due to staying up for the second all nighter in a row, and decided we wanted pizza. Around 2am we called Gus's and ordered a white pizza with pepperoni, the cost on the menu stated it was about $16. After their fees for eating after midnight, paying with a credit card, delivery fee and tax they told me the total was 21 dollars and some change. It stung a little, but still was okay, after all, no where else was open. They told me it would be about 30 minutes, but I asked them to wait and bring it around 3, when we would have enough time for a break. 

3:30 rolls around and after two phone calls to see what's up, the driver finally gets to our place, telling me that he couldn't get ahold of my cell even though Gus's called me about 5 minutes prior. The total bill when I got my pizza was $27.63! That is sure a lot different than 21 bucks! Angry, I called the manager and he stated that in addition to charging me 2 dollars for delivery, because I lived a block outside their delivery range, they tacked on another 5 dollars. He then proceeded to list off several fees that I couldn't keep track of, and would only give me 30% off my next order for the "forgetfulness" that his employees had for not telling me the true price. 30% off.. pfft, as if I would want to be bent over and reamed by their gouging again. 

The pizza was cold, bland and the cheese had hardened into almost another crust, which was at least better tasting than the actual crust of the pizza. Now that I found other places that deliver late like Eddies Pizza Lounge, I will never look at this slum again.I've definitely seen better Motel 6's in my lifetime. We stayed for one night after my birthday party at a bar down the road. HUGE MISTAKE. At 105 degrees out, a nice cool room would've been nice, but ours didn't work - AT ALL. The beds were so stiff and uncomfortable - mixed with the heat, none of us slept. The bed linens had burn holes (in a non smoking room) and stains that were hard and crusty, looking super fresh and unwashed from the last guest. Not to mention the stains on the mattress and box spring - SO GROSS. We noticed the next morning that there was a ton of gnats in our window - IN THE ROOM. I will never be staying at this location again.No bueno. I'm not a fan of chains to begin with, so when my fiance told me he wanted to spend his birthday here I was less than thrilled with his decision. I had made a reservation for a surprise party and our hostess was less than secretive when I brought my fiance through the door. She just pointed and said "Yeah, they're in there" -thus giving away with the fact that others were waiting for him. We were then greeted by our server. The first thing out of his mouth was "You guys splitting checks?" We were. He then told us "K. Make sure to not move around the table then. You'll make it confusing for me". I started to feel guilty about sitting in his section. Like we had done something wrong. Anytime we asked him for anything he replied with an annoyed look on his face and said "Yeah, give me a minute". Over and over. He left the table before getting everyone's drink order, forgot things, and we had to one person's food through the manager. In short, he sucked. 

Shotty service aside, the food was AWFUL also. I ordered the Steak Cortez and every bite was pure fatty nastiness. Won't be going back.Twice they used or gave me a schrader tube when I wanted a presta tube. Will not be back.I don't smoke cigarettes. Most people do. You can smoke outside. This place barely has an interior. And that is about it.

I guess the food is ok, but the drinks are outrageously priced and all the tap beer taste awful.

I only go there when i have to.

There is nothing charming about pissing on a fake rock outside, and there is even less charm applied to the fact that it is RIGHT NEXT to the bar. Gross as hell.

More often than not, i go home instead of hit "last call" with any of my friends when they go here unless i am already wasted, thus allowing for bad decisions.i guess my new thing will just be writing reviews about all the shitty bouncers at bars in tempe.

back on st. patrick's day i was going into casey moores and as i was locking up my bike as i watched a bouncer beat up an innocent drunk guy, who was already out of the bar and on the sidewalk trying to leave. he was pushing the guy telling him to leave but pretty much wasn't letting him leave by grabbing his shirt and throwing him around. the drunk guy kept saying "i'm trying to leave, stop touching me!" the bouncer ended up throwing the guy against a car and punching him while he was on the road. then he dragged him onto the side walk and held his head by the hair and started hitting his head on the sidewalk. the bouncer was bleeding from the hand and when he noticed he started saying "you bit me, omg i you bit me! i love putting people in jail. you're going to jail" once the cops showed up they wanted my story since i was a witness. me and two other people gave the police our story. once the bouncers hand was washed off his cut was clearly not a bite. probably cut it while beating the guy up. 
anyway, i went into the bar to get a drink and i was told to leave because i talked to the cops. i guess the managers really support a roided up bouncer beating up an innocent drunk guy.
SO fast forward 3-ish months and i go back to casey moores with some friends. i was there last night and GREAT the same bouncer is surprisingly still working there. when the night ended i was outside the bar in the parking lot and the bouncer comes up to me and whispers "if you fcking tell anyone about what happened you're not allowed back here" and i respond with "what??" and he says it again "you heard me. if you tell anyone about what happened you're not allowed back here. you're on a list you know" and then went into the bar. i hear the bouncer get crazy in the bar and start yelling and gathering staff and is talking and pointing at me. so i just stand there and wave.

also great idea to make a scene like that in front of a parking lot full of people if you don't want me telling anyone.

sorry bouncer. i told the internet about how shitty you are. maybe have some respect for people and talk to people nicely.

i'm not sure what else to say but i wanted to tell my story about 2/5 of my experiences of ever going there. i'm fine with not being let back in, especially if they're going to keep staff like this around.

BESIDES these incidents i've had good experiences here and the other staff is awesome. nice nice people.

*the bouncer who did this was a Caucasian, short stalky guy kinda chubby, short brown hair, has a scruffy beard, usually has a backward baseball cap on.Week end buffet was awful..nothing special about the food.. there were few items that were stale...A weekday regular food was ok...I wouldnt suggest pasand for indian food as phoenix has better indian restaraunts.Miss Trisha is great, but I think Marilyn Bostic is a greedy witch.  She charged two months worth of classes to my credit card because it was expiring that month.  I'm sorry, but her convenience is definitely not worth a double payment.  Anyone who helps themselves to my credit card is vile in my book.
We are back now after a year away.  My daughter missed dancing and the recital.  I hate giving money to this woman.
I'm sure you can find a better deal and more decent people at a different dance studio.Their ice cream machine seems like it's always down, don't go there if you are expecting a hot filet-o-fish sandwich.I've been a Pete's fan for over 45 years going back to the days of fresh cut fries and long slender crunchy shrimp.  For a quarter you could get two fish sandwiches.  I remember the patties being thicker with more fish and less breading. Pete's restaurant chain began changing their signature offerings sometime in the 1980's. I was a Pete's addict so I rolled with punches. The price and the red sauce will hook you in. This being said this store has taking an all time low. What's with the little flat over cooked dry shrimp nuggets, terrible.  Maybe a little salt to bring out the flavors. After  all these years I am looking for a new deep fried seafood fast food restaurant.This is the one of the worse Wendy's ever! 

Today I went in for lunch and one of the employees (with a raspy voice) was very loud and the other employees were telling her not to yell. Meanwhile, the girl taking my order had so many flakes in her hair I was afraid they were going to fall into my food. Talk about an appetite ruiner!

A few weeks back when I went thru the drive-thru, the same lady with raspy voice, took my money without saying one word, much less a thank you. Sorry, but if I give someone money the least they should do is say thank you!

I also don't like that you can't get your own sodas, especially since they ignore you when you try to get a refill. I will drive to a different Wendy's for my lunch break from now on.This is one of the worst airports in the US.

First, if it all possible only take carry on luggage when flying into LAS.  It often takes 30 or more minutes for your bags to start arriving on the belt.  This is a huge pain for me, as I generally prefer to check everything.

Short term parking is metered.  I do not carry change, so I have to plan for this when picking others up.

Now I am sure you are asking why would you have to park to pick someone up.  That is because it can be nearly impossible to drop off or pick up people curb side.  Traffic clogs up easily and often.

There is no Sky Club or partner equivalent.  This is actually more of a Delta issue, but I can not blame them for not wanting to invest much in this airport.

The taxi line can be rediculously long at times.  Apparently flights come only in bunches to LAS.  On that note for those of you without a lot of experience using taxis, be careful, Las Vegas cabbies love to rip you off with the scenic route that they claim will take the same amount of time because it avoids traffic.  I have had several friends that do not travel much get ripped off by this tactic.

Security here is rediculous.  The line is often gigantic.  Planning is clearly optional for the TSA here.

My last complaint is one of the biggest for me.  The only major airline that considers this airport a hub is Southwest.  I know Southwest refuses to label hubs, but lets be honest with ourselves.  LAS is a Southwest hub.

The one upside is that the airport is very close to the south end of the strip.Dumpy Cattle truck style Airlines, the crew I encountered were downright rude and sarcastic towards passengers , they seemed to be  enjoying watching the latest passengers boarded scramble and beg for seats that were purchased!
Saw the same culture of ignorance on outbound and inbound flights !
Old broken down dirty planes !!

No way !! 

Rather take the bus!!**HOTEL REVIEW**

Got a free room so wanted to check it out. Asked for an upgrade to one of their newer rooms but was denied. I remember during the Yelp Spring Break we had a tour of the suites and it was really nice so I thought maybe the rooms would be similar. The furnitures in the rooms were new and good, but man.. everything else screamed ghetto. The bathrooms were old and the showers felt like I was at a gym. I had to wear sandals while showering because the floors looks disgusting. It is also very noisy and you can hear everything on the street. We heard sirens, cars honking, people yelling. 

I will never stay here again, no matter if I have a free room or not.

The casino and cheap drinks were cool though.On my recent trip to Vegas, I played 4 rounds of golf.  This course was my least favorite.  I was solo, and when I checked it, she said I could go out whenever I wanted.  The driving range area was under construction so I went out cold.  The bag drop girl gave me grief about having a cooler, but gave me one of their coolers instead, which still seemed silly.

The holes are very narrow, and most of them were short.  The 11th par 3 was 98 yards from the white tees.  Most holes were being worked on by the grounds crew.  I estimate that at least 10 holes were under some kind of repair.  Playing as a single, I didn't run into another other group during my time there.  It was like I bought a golf course for myself.  This was nice, but also very weird when all the other courses I played were packed.  After finishing the round, I understand why no one was there.

My favorite hole was the 9th and 18th by far.  

The beverage girl came around several times, so that wasn't an issue.  I was told in the pro shop that I would have a chance to beat the pro for a chance to win free merchandise in the pro shop.  I never saw the pro, so I didn't spend a dime in the pro shop other than the greens fee.

With all the repair work, I probably wouldn't bother with that course for a couple of years, if I was to go back at all. There are so many other great courses in the area. That course felt like you were playing in a shoe box because of the distance, narrow fairways, and highways bordering several of the holes.If I could give negative stars, I think I actually would in this case. Our experience was THAT bad. I was in Las Vegas with my husband and family and we were craving some pho. We happened upon this place and we thought how bad could it be? People can't really mess up pho THAT bad. Boy, were we wrong. 

It was bad right from the start, the restaurant smelled funny, like a family of wet dogs decided to take up shelter there. The service was horrible and when the waitress finally came by to take our order, she was extremely pushy, basically forcing us to order an appetizer even though we didn't really want to. We ended up getting the sticky rice with roasted chicken, which was okay, but we had felt extremely pressured to order it. The waitress then had the gall to come back and tell us that we should order another appetizer and proceeded to almost place the order for us, until we had to almost scream no, and say that we just want our entrees. 

I ordered the vermicelli noodles with roasted pork and an egg roll. This is a staple dish for me at Vietnamese restaurants, and I have never been so sorely disappointed. First, it took FOREVER for the them to bring us our entrees (and it's not like they were busy, there were about three tables that night), and when they did I almost wished they hadn't. The noodles were hard. The pork was tough, poorly seasoned and looked like the leftovers from someone else's meal. The egg roll was the only halfway decent thing in the bowl, and it was tiny. I could barely finish 1/4 of the bowl, and it wasn't because I was full. 

It wasn't even cheap. I know other reviews have said this place is a cheap eat. That was not my experience. My vermicelli noodles were $8, and it is usually $5-$6 at other restaurants. I wouldn't mind paying a couple bucks more if it were good. Or even halfway decent. But it was absolutely appalling. 

We finally left the place disappointed, disgusted and hungry. I hope I can save the rest of you from this place. Run away immediately.It's now closed, sadly.Usually get good service, but not all the time. I sat there 15 minutes today at lunch with my wife and watched 3 tables come in after us, and all order. Meanwhile we sat there with water and no menu's, and no orders taken from us (drinks or food). We had enough after table 4 came in and ordered. We just left, having only tried the water (and still no one noticed us)! There was only 5-7 tables in the whole place at the time!Gold Coast has landed right on my Let's Not Las Vegas list.

This place is more suited for the Golden Buckeye set.  As in 55 and over.  It smells funny.  Don't get me wrong, it's not Knights Inn outside Columbus Ohio (inside joke) or anything...it's just not very nice.  

Did I mention it smells funny?  Maybe a little sweaty.  It's not flat out bad.  It's just not very good.  I have stayed in worse places.  

Some people would probably give the Gold Coast 3 stars.  Like people that have not stayed in a lot of hotels.  Or that have not stayed in nice hotels.  Or that toss around stars freely.  Or that give pity stars.

One final note - on my way out I saw a woman dozing as she stood.  Head nodded forward, slight slump to the shoulders, eyes closed.  The problem was she was on the down escalator.  It was pretty funny when she got to the end.  And then as I entered the parking garage I had to step over a huge pink and chunky mess of vomit.  Wonderful.Buffet here is terrible on Friday night seafood buffet! Crab was so dry it wouldn't come out of the shell! And for $20 bucks per person, the Alliante Friday night seafood buffet is much more worth it!Paid $175 for a non-smoking newly renovated Samba Suite.  The upholstery had stains, there were crumbs on the carpet and the room smelled of smoke and deodorizer.  We asked to be moved and were happy with our Samba Suite on the 37th floor until we realized we could've danced to 3am in our own room.  We were able to hear the pounding beats of the Voodoo Lounge from the 51st floor!  I believe the Rio has an obligation to make their guests aware of this significant fact.  Don't get me wrong, we enjoy a good party... Just like my sleep too!I used to like this place and my favorite was the Thai Beef Jerkey and especially the sauce that came with it! 

My last encounter at Krung Thai wasa couple of years ago and there was a big piece of broken glass in my soup! WTF?!!?? When we confronted the manager and the crazy waitress they felt no remorse!

So goodbye or laa korn Krung Thai!Nowhere to park, little room to sit and the staff is cold... This place is worse than the DMV!!! Oh, and they require a payment before they even see you.

I went in just because I needed a referral to see a chiropractor and I had to convince the doctor that chiropractors help people, I could tell this doctor saw them as little more than snake oil salesmen.Stay away from this shuttle "service". Although the trip from the airport is fine and pleasant, we bought a round trip ticket at the airport thinking it was going to save time & money. Nope. I called in advance to reserve our pickup from the Luxor for our 6:05pm Sunday 11/13 departure and they told me that they didn't have any shuttles going to the Luxor for the entire day, except at 9:30 AM? WHAT?????????????????????????
THIS IS LAS VEGAS!!!!!! These people take your money even though they know they don't run all day. If this information was made available, I would have saved my money and just planned on taking a cab back to the airport. Which was the exact same price as the shuttle in the first place. Basically, save your money and if you are staying at a hotel at the beginning of the strip, just take a cab, it will cost you the same thing or nearly the same. I will never use this shuttle again.Horrible service. Her name is Jamie. Very very rude. Asked for a cup of water which made her mad ! She said I have to buy a empty cup for $3 !!! Truly what she was thinking ??? Never has this rude subway employee. Management should do something about it. But I guess you have to judge other reviews as well.DO NOT BOOK ONLINE. THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY TWICE. The week I was in Vegas they had the computer SYSTEM DOWN TWICE. Plus like many other reviews you see here, when you come home late at night your card key will not let you in the room. My friends and I were charged online via confirmation they could not check so they took our cards charged again, then charged us a third time when our key cards did not work late at night! Do not take this risk. Don't gamble on your place to stay.Never again.

I had stayed here a couple of times previously which were mediocre, but not really bad.  The last time I stayed for business with coworkers, and after checking into my room I went to the restroom and found feces still splattered on the outside of the toilet bowl.  If something as blatant as this wasn't cleaned prior to check-in then I am terrified to consider what else remains unsanitary.

Even worse I was sent a survey following my visit in which I detailed my experience.  Have never received a word of feedback from the hotel.  What exactly is the point of asking for a survey from guests if you don't acknowledge them when they place a complaint?I have a silver elite Marriott member, so it is not my first time at the rodeo making an online reservations.   The front desk was beyond anything i have ever experienced at a Marriott.  Would not give me the room that I booked, said it was not available and then tried to tell me I booked it through AAA.  Even after I accessed my laptop at the front desk and showed them the type of room that they advertise they REFUSED to do anything.  No accountability, nothing was offered to me for their mistake, it was really infuriating as I had 2 teenage boys with me and I was given one queen bed, really front desk lady, I booked that type of room?  I don't think so.  
The hotel is in desperate need of new carpeting, it is disgusting.  Pool is like  Motel 6, I wasn't expecting a big Las Vegas hotel, exactly why I stayed here but I will not be back, very disappointing.  
Seems many have had similar rude front desk experiences, and yes, it makes one want to try out those Hilton hotels and rack up some honors points with them.  
Embassy Suites is a few blocks away, next time I will book thereThis was honestly one of the most disgusting places I have been inside. Old pillow cases were all over the floor, the pillow cases and sheets on the bed were stained, the bed spread is probably as old as the building. Our shower ran all night long the walls had brown stuff smeared all over, half of the power outlets did not work. The hallways smelled of rotten old building. I would absolutely NEVER stay here again. With all their money they need some upgrades I'm hoping I didn't catch anything while I was there. Gross!!!!!You know how some people "take a break " from their kids . 
Well this place is where people like to take their kids to Vegas with them so that mommy and daddy can gamble and the kiddos can go to the arcade. 
My boyfriend has never been to Vegas and he wanted go check it out... 
I almost wanted to shoot myself in the head. 
The staff were rude. The hotel smelled. 
The buffet was horrible! It's 30 bucks a person and it tastes like shit! 
If you have kids you know that they would be begging you to go on the rides 
The wrist bands are 30 bucks and the rides by themselves are $5-8 dollars. 
Rock & Rita's was pretty good. That's one thing I did enjoy about circus circus. 
So bottom line if you don't like kids and you are thinking about staying here. You may not like it. 
But if you have kids and they are between the ages of 7-12 I think they'll enjoy it.I have stayed at Circus Circus  before over the years for work conventions etc.
 this last time was a joke it was like a ghetto casino from  arriving, waiting for ever in a line 
I had online Mlife reservations with a $92 deposit on a $75 a night room. I thought ok reasonable,  after the long driving around parking structure to find a parking spot within a black of front desk.  line &  having the bell hop take us up to our room to find a half naked man in a robe on the bed   then we had to fight through the crowds with our luggage all over again to get to the front desk. got a slight I am sorry and another room lug all the way back up through casino past towers to the room.  Called front Desk what time is the pool open till?
 they said 9Pm    then the fun part locating the pool... it is not even on the property but across the street at a KOA camp ground. we asked 2 staff members where it was  The first girl said " I don't know this place be\very well just from the parking lot to my area, second a maintenance guy who said we had to go down stairs walk across the 4 lanes of traffic and it was there .
 we found it walked in and it was a mess of wet towels people passed out, low end looking ghetto crowd baby diapers under lawn chairs ...Used  spilled/ vomited  red looking stuff all over a lamp post  and pool deck. it was like wow  what a shit hole! 
Then the life guard blows the whistle after we finally just got our drink and was told the pool was closed ...I said the front desk said 9 pm?
 he said no 8pm so now the dreaded walk back through the run down hallways and maze of stairs , escalators and elevators  and shoulder shrugging unhelpful staff .
we left  on checking out I received a bill on my credit card  for an additional $161.00 on top of the $92  a total of $253.25 
 when I was quoted on line at $75 a night 
 beware  DO NOT HAVE THE SAME HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE .
 I think this hotel is just waiting to be demolished and is a MGM tax write off as a slum.Umm, I'm sorry to all of you who are giving this place rave reviews - maybe I just had a bad experience. Just wanted to share my experience at Ellis Island in Las Vegas. My husband and I went to LV for the first time this weekend, and Ellis Island was highly recommended for their $6.99 steak dinner. Umm... NO. Let me tell you why we'll NEVER go there again!

* We waited 35 minutes for what was supposed to be a 15-20 min wait.
* Our 35 minute wait was right next to an open table, to which they took us to. HUH? Are you serious that we've been sitting by this open table for 35 minutes and you're just now sitting us in it?
* Our waitress took FOREVER and was not that helpful.
* The salad was your basic crap-bagged salad from the local grocery store, with one tomato. Yuck.
* When we received our steak dinner, it was char-burnt, tough, with NO SEASONING. The baked potato was chewy and they had a little elementary cafeteria-style pouch of sour cream next to it. It looked a little.. uhh... GOVERNMENT FOOD PROGRAM-ish??
* We didn't even finish our meal. Our waitress never checked on us, and we were ready to go. We waited and looked around as she never showed up again. I was almost about to take my food up to the register and ask them for my check. She finally shows up, we ask for our check and we leave.

Oh! The best part? They say, "join the players club and you get $5 in free slot play!" So we say, okay that meal was a dud, but let's at least try to win some money if anything. - well guess what? We go sign up, they give us our players card, and tell us it will activate in 24-48 hours!!! HUH!!! Are you serious! 

Our experience there was unbelievable. In the WORST way. I can't believe we walked all that way for nothing. Oh well, it's better that we found out, right?

Maybe it was a "cultural" thing. I noticed not many people of our skin tone in the restaurant, as well as on this review site. Hmm.I had to have the maid come in and change our sheets that had been changed earlier with sheets that were stained with who knows what.  But it was disgusting and I can't imagine the first maid that put the sheets on could have missed it.  

Our neighbors had a nice screaming match that sounded like it could get violent at any moment.  I called security, they never showed.  

The hallways smell of old cat litter box. Nasty! 

The front desk people are rude and don't even let you speak.  They just speak over you and tell you NO.

The whole place is old and needs some serious renovations.  Our room looked like they tried to remodel at some point but it was more of slapping some new stuff over the old stuff.I booked this hotel because it was offered as one of the hotels on conference website. We were offered some extra perks, like a reduction in the resort fee, including a set of comedy tickets. When I called the resort to ask questions I was told the convention I was attending was a 5 min walk from there.  This was complete misinformation, it was well over a mile walk  to the convention center location. One of the reasons I took the time to call and ask about this is because I have some physical issues that made walking difficult for me and I was trying to be prepared.  I would have made other arrangements than walking in the heat of a nasty summer day if I had known this.  

I Stayed in Monaco towers. Must have been the oldest dingiest part of the hotel. Bathroom floor looked dirty.  The room was sweltering hot when we  first arrived. The air conditioner must have been on it's last leg because it really never cooled off properly even after being on all night.  Every time we left for the day the cleaning staff turned it off so we returned to a hot stuffy room.  The pillows were small, flat and very uncomfortable, the sheets were scratchy.  The bathrooms featured the cheapest toilet paper and soap I have ever seen.  Felt like I was washing with Lava soap.  The gal who checked us in was rude and argued with me about including free comedy show tickets we were promised with our package, she finally acted like she was doing me a favor by giving the to me.   

The morning of our check out I was just getting out of the shower and housekeeping opened the door while I was nude.  This was just after 9 am.  SERIOUSLY!!!  This was Sun morning, this Vegas, people are still  sleeping at that hour!!!!  Check out time was still an hour and a half away.  I will never stay here again and won't be recommending it to anyone.  Talked to the manager about the situation with housekeeping..she offered to remove the "hotel fee" which was $5. Gee thanks, at that point I felt I was wasting my breath discussing any other issues with her.  This was a business trip, I was hot tired and exhausted when I got back to my room.  I didn't have the time or energy to deal with this during my stay.  I realize I was not paying for luxury.  I wasn't expecting that, what I was expecting was a clean comfortable room that I could get a good nights sleep in.Purchased a dog not knowing anything. Dog is healthy and playful.  But the pure breed papers we got with dog turns out to be from Apri American pet registry.  Which is a puppy mill and the papers of are worthless. I was deceived thinking I was buying a quality dog with their premium prices!!!  STAY AWAY!Ruined our Valentine plans.  We made reservations which we brought with us for 8:30 p.m.  When we arrived a long line and chaotic waiting area greeted us.  After waiting 15 minutes to check in we were greeted by a rude front desk person, who let us know it would be 35 minutes or more past our reservation till seating, but to wait in the lounge which was now standing room only.  After watching several arguments between patrons and the front desk, and being told there was no general manager available, we left.  Thank you Ruth's Chris for ruining our plans.After waiting 5 minutes for a hostess to appear, we we escorted to the spot where it all went down. 

I reminisced over meals years ago when plates of hot and tasty food were served in sister restaurants around the states... then:

Calamari: was lukewarm and tasted like fish sticks. Enough said. 

Rice: was dry and al dente... at an asian restaurant.

Orange peel shrimp: was the best dish, owing to its sugary sauce and only being slightly overcooked. The the orange rind tasted the opposite of fresh... I literally imagined oranges in a pile of two-day old trash being scooped up by the cook. It wasn't nearly as good as the same dish a couple years ago at another Changs.

Mongolian beef: tasted like shards of a tire. The green onions were offensive, inedible and awkward.

Ginger ale: watered down.

Desserts: in my haste to depart, I ordered the one dish I could remember: mini-desserts, aka, sweet baby food for adults. One or two layers of this crap actually tasted edible, if only in small concurrent quantities.

This spot reflects on Americans' taste in food the way the WCW... u get the idea. Quality of all chain restaurants seems to experience the same sad decline that has befallen applebees, the olive garden, et al.--which threw quality under the bus for profit margins. 

The next time I crave a cheap and decent chain-y meal, I'll drive my bourgeoisie romp to the Cheesecake Factory or Ri Ra.As I was sitting there at the Rainforest Cafe their lightning storm sounds began and I turn around and see a small child with a terrified look in his face. I thought to myself  "Hey buddy I know exactly how you feel". I say that in the sense that I was terrified of the prices, service, and food I just had. This restaurant is probably one of the worst I've been too in a while. The only redeeming quality of this place is the kids might like it but is it worth paying the obscene prices for crappy food? Probably not. 

After a night of drinking a few friends and I decided on the Rainforest Cafe because the other "Cafe" at the MGM Casino had some horrible reviews. Sadly I didn't bother reading the reviews for the rainforest cafe beforehand. Their burgers where overcooked and dry, their turkey wrap was dry and had no zero dressing. Our food took a good 40 minutes to arrive. The waiters bringing out the food where rude and it seemed to bother them if you asked them for missing items. What a disappointment.Wonder why they keep the lights low in this establishment? It's because they're serving you rotten food.
I had THE most horrible experience at this restaurant, so bad in fact that I will never visit another Rainforest Cafe at any location again in my lifetime. 
Our party had 4 people in it and we wanted to grab something to eat before watching Love. I ordered a Portobello Mushroom Burger (only maybe 2 vegetarian options on the menu). Our server was nice but the service was extremely slow.
Finally we got our food. My burger was lukewarm and my fries cold. It was bland, dry, distasteful,  and even the presentation was horrible. About 1/3 of the way into my burger I felt as if the taste was off. I opened the bun to find that the shredded lettuce they put on my burger was wilted, brown, and rotting. Disgusting! I lost my appetite immediately. 
I waited and waited and waited for our server to finally come over to check on us. Upon mentioning to him that I was disappointed and dissatisfied with my order he offered to get the manager of the restaurant. I accepted. Another waiting game. Our server returned and told us that "the manager is too busy" to come to our table. Mind you the restaurant wasn't even 1/4 full given that we came during the off season. At this point we wanted to just leave. I asked if I could get the price of my meal deducted from the tab and he walked off to get our bill. 5 minutes later the manager comes to our table.
She asked what the problem was, I told her, and  her reply was "our lettuce isn't rotten, the cook checked it, the lettuce wilts when it comes into contact with heat" which is true but it does not cause the lettuce to brown. Browning means that is is old and rotting. I explained this to her and she looked dead at me and said (with a horrible snide attitude) "You didn't realize the lettuce was rotten after already eating half of it?" Never in my life have I had a manager of an establishment sass me while I point out their product is below mediocre. She deducted half of the price of the burger after giving everyone at our table a horrible attitude and experience. 
No one in my party ever wants to visit another Rainforest Cafe based on the experience the manager gave us. 
If you want amazing food, excellent service for a decent price go to Gordon Ramsey's BurGR in Planet Hollywood. The difference, literally, is night and day.My wife and I decided to treat our selfs after winning at the tables. I have to say this was no treat. This place is morbidly overpriced, The food is average at best. Service was pretentious at times and comical at other time. There are restaurants that I have been to that were expansive, how ever those have warrented the price tag. This place was a joke. The only reason I am giving an extra star is because we both had a good lough. I just remembered it was not a lough it was a lough upside down. I am reading all these great reviews of this glorified haute cuisine wanna be, and I am puzzled. Sooooo many places in Vegas that truly serve fantastic food with great service. This one is not it.Horrible - absolute crooks in the service dept.

Asked my wife to take our hybrid in for an oil change.  She had a coupon, but they said the 0W20 that the car takes is a "bit" more expensive.  To the tune of the oil change costing 65 dollars after they had already done the service.  The car doesn't even take a full 4 quarts and they are using that basic honda filter.  

How do these clowns sleep at night?Went there for Valentines Day what a mistake! 

We ordered some sushi rolls which took forever to get to our table,.We orderd the screaming orgasm which was drencehed in sauce, and another roll which I do not remember was also drenched in sauce, I could not even taste the fish. All I tasted was the sauce. I am a fan of suaces on sushi rolls but this was ridiculous.

The fried tofu was horrible! The sauce was so sour I could not eat it. The best thing I had was the california roll then again how can you screw that up!

This place was just a waste of time and money!I visited this restaurant many years ago, in fact right after they opened. I thought the food was terrific, so I decided to come back. After my most recent visit, I will never visit this restaurant again.

I guess they take the "Panevino" label quite literally, and you must order food AND wine. If you don't want wine, the waitstaff will scoff at you and mock you for being cheap. That's right: the waitstaff will judge you for what you order. I didn't realize that I had to get the most expensive dishes or whatever else they had in mind for me; I thought I could just order items that I wanted. I guess not.

The food was very good, and the atmosphere is nice, but the condescending waitstaff has no place treating customers with disrespect just because the customers aren't interested in drinking wine. It's unacceptable. Everyone felt uncomfortable and pressured, and it is not appreciated. Vegas is a vacation town, and this was the worst experience of the vacation. I will not be back, ever.Wtf. I prepaid everything online and when i arrived, they ask for either an ssn or credit card for credit check. Which i have neither. Debit cards are not ok and they dont accept cash deposit. If you arent renting, why the fuck would you accept my prepay. And yeah... They CANT refund me at the station and asked me to call customer service.I came here back in late January and my friend raved about this place so, our friends all decided to have takeout here. We're ordered crab Rangoon, pad Thai, pad kee Mao, yellow curry chicken, fried rice, etc. I had a taste of everything and I was sooooooo disappointed with everything. I'm from SF and thai food here is amazing!  I was really looking forward to eating this meal until I opened my box and the noodles were so different. It wasn't the wide flat noodles they serve in SF- it was thin flat noodles that were so bland that soy sauce didn't even help boost the flavor. The fried rice was nasty but the curry chicken was the best. I wished I had ordered that instead. The staff were nice enough to call us a cab and give us all the utensil and paper plates needed for our group. The restaurant was cleaned but at the hour of 5:00pm, there was no one dining there a all.Probably one of the worst Greek/ Mediterranean places I've been to. Very few places out here really know how to make authentic Greek/ Mediterranean food. The first time I went here I got severe food poisoning from the chicken schwarma plate, most likely due to the meat under proper temperature and the food overall was very bland and non-appetizing. It's been months since that visit and I finally went here today to give it another shot. BIG MISTAKE! I ordered an order of hummus, falafel, and a chicken schwarma. First off, the chicken schwarma was horrible. It was like taking chicken from Taco Bell, add some shriveled tomatoes and some tahini on artificial pita bread, and you've got yourself the ideal American version of this traditional wrap. They don't even know how to make a schwarma!!! The falafel was so salty and grainy...and if you've had great falafel before, you would know that Stephano's version is just crap. The hummus had NO FLAVOR whatsoever. When hummus is made, the garbanzo beans and tahini bring out such a robust flavor all on its own when made the traditional and proper way. Everything I've tried thus far is just soooo overly processed. Eating at Stephano's is like eating at the McDonald's of the Greek and Mediterranean food genre. I will never go back again. As a matter a fact, go right around the corner to kabob express on eastern and trop. Now that place is a lot more decent, freshly-made food that won't put a hole in your wallet. I swear coming from back east and Europe, people don't really know what good food is around here. Best Lebanese place I've tried thus far here in this town? Ali Baba's. hands down. * yells at Vegas. " go there! Go there!"* you will not be disappointed!! :)Worst car rental return experience. I rented a car in Oakland to drive some sample products down to Las Vegas. Two issues with the car rental experience: 
1. Car sucks
2. Very difficult return process

First of all, the KIA minivan they handed over swirls around on freeway, and it shut down and locked its own ignition in the middle of the road. Took me half an hour to get it restarted in the middle of an intersection. It definitely made me feel like I should have bought life insurance also before getting Into this car. 

Secondly, the instructions on my reservation indicates that I shall return the vehicle at Treasure Island Hotel. 

Once I arrived at Treasure Island after a long 11 hour drive, there was no sign directing anyone where to return the vehicle. After looping around the hotel 5 times in a congested Friday Vegas traffic, I finally found a tiny little sign hidden on the roof part near the entrance of the self-parking structure. Who would've guessed to look there?! 

When i parked the rental car at the spot indicated by the sad sad sign, there was no one checking in any rental cars as if they know their inventories are CRAP also,  or directing the customers where to go to give back the keys. Trust me, I was in every hurry to return that .....toy car. After walking around asking several hotel employees and calling Dollar's customer service line (that representative was as much of a help as the hidden sign, 
He said "Ma'am, the office closes at 5 PM, so there is no one checking in vehicles right now. Please find the drop off box. 
Me: Yes, and it's 4 PM right now. So what's your next better advice? Where is your office or the drop box?
He said: you just have to walk around, Ma'am. ..... smart answer, bro.)

I finally found a tiny booth inside the hotel lobby to finish up the process after another 45 minutes of guessing and waiting. I guess the company makes it clear they don't want their vehicles back! 

Never again trust Dollar.For the longest time, I'd heard nothing but good things about the Callaway (now Taylormade) Golf Experience. By the time I set foot here, it was already showing its age: all of the water at the course had been drained, the tee boxes were beat up, and the greens weren't in the best of shape. My most recent trip was in April for a bachelor's party and we had a great time despite the condition of the course.

Apparently, Taylormade took over this course a few months ago and when my group arrived a few days ago, the main entrance and pro shop were being renovated. No problem, since we were just sneaking in a quick nine before dinner. I assumed that with the ownership change that the course conditions would have been addressed.

Not so.

Unfortunately, the course was more run-down than my trip in April. The tee boxes were basically shredded wheat and the greens were terrible. We started our round during daylight and by the time night rolled around, it seemed like the back parts of the course were not lit at all.

Now, I understand that courses will not be in immaculate condition during the winter months, but I've played public par-3 and executive courses for $10 (with a free cart) that were in FAR better condition than this one. I paid $27 on a weekday (with an additional $10 for the cart) and felt totally ripped off. Yes, it's great that the course is conveniently located on the strip and it's open during renovation, but they're still charging prices that reflect a fully realized Taylormade Golf Experience.  Paying nearly $40 for a course in this condition is ridiculous. 

Frankly, Taylormade should be embarrassed to have its name attached to this place. Callaway really dropped the ball when it let this place get worn down to the state that it's in, but if Taylormade is more concerned with renovating the pro shop and gift store than the course itself, then there's no way I would ever recommend it. 

The one star I'm giving is entirely for the staff. Everyone I encountered was  courteous and professional. My group checked in with no problems and were treated well. After our round, we had a drink at the bar and the bartender comped one of our drinks due to the stench coming from the pro-shop remodel. It's not his fault that the course is in bad shape, but at least he cared enough about our experience that he took care of us. Five-star employees deserve a five-star facility.

Until the word is out that the par-3 course has been taken care of, stay away. If you're really dying to hit some balls, then stick with their bi-level driving range, which looked like it was still in decent shape. Just don't get suckered into paying full price for 9 holes of golf.Store is nice and big, bright, organized. Makes me feel like an old shop based on how nothing is bagged and boarded so you have to look for a good copy which I like. 

However they have no ethics about pricing. I bought some comics off the new wall, not marked up at all. A woman rang me up never said a word about what these comics were being sold for, even though it wasn't marked on the books and they clearly are making up their price. So I trusted her total because I wasn't adding up what I bought before I bought it, I just knew i grabbed 10-14 comics. So I get home and see that I was charge $6.60 for a comic that every other store sells for $3.99.  Now this was an incentive comic of 1:3, but no other shop in Las Vegas or Cali has ever charged me more than $3.99 for this because 1:3 is an extremely low incentive, and cover price for the regular version is $3.99, even Velvet Undergound will charge 15% below the $3.99. 

So I thought this was a mistake and called and asked why was I charged more than $3.99, and was told that's what the price was.  Then when I asked why wasn't it marked with that price because it's clearly their own price and not common for those books, I was told since there was no price I should have asked.  

And I completely agree, it's my fault. It's my fault for not assuming I was going to be killed on the price for trying to give some business to my local shops instead of buying online like everyone else is doing nowadays. But still I do not feel this was a valid reason.  So by their pricing logic, they can just make prices up on the spot if they felt like it since nothing is marked with the correct price. Granted it's their business they can do what they like, but it was a major turn off for me to ever shop here again.

It would take me too long having to ask every single price before I bought a comic.ZERO STARS!!! CUSTOMER SERVICE FAIL!!! MAKE SURE YOU READ THEIR FINE PRINT!!!
My card on file expired and they charged me a $25 processing fee to run the new card!!!! The membership is only $22 a month and their fee's are 113% of their rate! If I wasn't stuck in my contract I'd happily take my money ANYWHERE else.glutton for punishment, i am not. accurate documentation of prescription- fail. communication with 1-800-contacts & fill of script- fail.There are no words, NONE that can even explain the misery this place is but I will try.

The service, if you want to call it that is absolute CRAP.  Mia at the front desk is rude and should not deal with people.

Ian at the Concierge, if you want to call it that, doesn't care and couldn't help dry a wet rat.

People here are liars.  We were told they have internet, for free. Lies. When I called to complain, they told me to get over it and did not provide an alternate (AND I'M AN OWNER HERE).  

They don't care about you once you have purchased, they only want the new $$$.  

The location is also about a 20 minute or $25 cab ride to the trip.  They told us they had shuttle service, they  no longer do another thing they lied about.

They only have 1 restaurant on premises and its just bar food $10 for 6 chicken wings. No fries, no sides. nothing.

This place is the worst and I wish on everything holy I didn't own here.

Seriously, don't stay here. You are better off on the strip.Worst service ever, I was in line while someone was getting an order and the guy who was at the cashier was giving a lot of attitude towards the customer. Especially since he was paying and taking out coins from his pocket. He practically threw the guy his straw after he picked up his drink. After drinking my drink and on my laptop that is connected to the plug and the cord was on the floor. One of their coworkers was mopping the floor and practically wiped my whole cord with his mop. Who knows where they've wiped their mop?! Isn't that disgusting and health hazard?What's with the freshness and quality of ingredients served in this city??

Ordered some wings and a salad for delivery. Shouldnt be that complicated and I should not feel completely sick to my stomach a few hours after finishing eating!

Chicken wings were way overcooked, and tasted funny. Salad was alright, but it felt like it was prepared 48h prior, and left in the fridge for the next delivery order (mine!)

Seriously feel like I am going to puke now and have stomach cramps. And I dont have a delicate stomach, I mean I have lived and traveled in Africa and Amazonian jungle.

Do I have to stick with 3* Michelin restaurants to not get sick in this city!?  GrrrrrrTHIS PLACE SUCKS! The food is fair, the prices are outrageous for a neighborhood place (think  Rao's or Valentino's). They charge $30 for corkage and have a terrible wine list, don't honor reservations and close early all the time. The owner can't even legally use his name, Piero, because he cheated one of his former partners and got sued. Really not worth the effort.Never going back. We went on Mothers Day, never having been here, and not knowing a reservation was needed. We walked in and I was immediately impressed with the decor. The Host asked us if we had a reservation and we said no. He told us they were all booked. Meanwhile the place was empty! We were told they could try to accommodate us but they are fully booked. He was very rude. They finally agreed to seat us in a lounge area outside. It wasn't a table but it was fine. We sat there for over 20 minutes without being even acknowledged. We finally left. I will never be back. From the moment we walked in we were treated like they didn't care about our business. And once we sat and were not waited on that was obvious. This is NO way to run a business. Where is the customer service? If they told us in the beginning that they couldn't accommodate us that would have been fine. But treating us like they were doing us a favor??? Not ok.After reading the great reviews I decided to try Famous Nails.  I called in advance for two pedicures, when we arrived only one of us were seated, this was fine.. however after both of us were in the chairs, only one of us were serviced.  It took thirty minutes for the second pedicure to begin, when Marianne the "owner" started on her she actually told her that it looked like her feet hadn't been attended to in a year!! "Rude"
No apology for making her wait.  She was rushing so fast through the service, we actually asked if someone else could finish.  She said fine and walked away.  Unbelievable!  She made us feel very uncomfortable, and actually seemed upset with us.  
Very disappointed with her disregard and outright rudeness.  No apology necessary.  We won't be back.
This is what happens when these shops overbook.  Client suffers.Arrived and guy at counter acted like it was his first day... Asked for a mani peddie and he leads me to the pedi chair ...... Sat for 25 min and nothing got up and left!!! Worst service ever!!! Beware!!! Looked dirty...I needed new tires before I took my trip to California, so I came here, because it's right down the street from my house, customer service was fine, I didn't have a problem with that. After i get my tires I head to California, not even an hour on the road and my tire light comes on. I call my dad, because he's a tire expert, selling them for years. He told me to just continue to California, and he'll check them when I get there. When I get there he puts air in my tire, but the very next day the light was on again. So we go to a Tire place and they took the tire off, and they found that the sensor was broke and was tried to fix with piping tape. PIPING TAPE!!!can you believe that. So we call big I tires and told them, and  they said they would order a new sensor and take care of it when I got back to Vegas. 
Ok so I work in a restaurant, and when we mess up someone's order, we're very apologetic and we take care of the customer right away, they're first priority because we screwed up, so naturally I expected the same thing from Big O tires, well I was WRONG, they were some what apologetic, but I sat there for almost 2 hours waiting for something that should of took 5 minutes. I did get a free oil change for my trouble, but still, this is ridiculous to me, and I will never go back, except maybe for the oil change and even then it's iffy.NV Energy refuses to allow me to make a payment arrangement with them.
What company doesn't allow that? I have a family to worry about - now I have to worry about not having power?
I wish I could cancel with them and move to someone else, like a cell carrier or internet. Southwest Gas always worked with me, my friends and my family. What happened to that?
I guess I just don't understand why they can't work with me. They're getting their money, just not in their time.Does anyone know what they're doing there??  Computer department is beyond bad.  One guy with an accent loved to throw things on my cart and tell me that "I needed them".  I don't think so.  His english starts to fail him and the most convenient times.  Typical.  Luca I believe is his name.  Avoid this guy and find ANYONE else.

Never going back.  Ever.After 18 years in the valley, we finally made the trek down to Durant's.

First, I will preface my review by stating that we did not stay for dinner. Long story short, we bailed after they brought out the bread basket. 

Cutting to the chase....

Cons:

* Entering through the kitchen isn't the best marketing strategy when your kitchen really needs a remodel.
* The entire place needs one of those remodeling shows to do a surprise make over.
* Carpeted restaurants leave your customers wondering just how dirty that carpet is.
* A bar tender should know the wine list, or at least be able to muddle through a question about a bottle of wine.
* Bath rooms are a bit tired and need a remodel.
* Wait staff needs some training, a tad way to "Denny's casual" for us.
* Bread basket and vege plate need some work. If I am dropping 300 bucks for 2 people, pick up the level a bit.
* Small detail, but the wine glasses and glass wear need to be updated. Nothing worse that drinking a 150 bottle of wine out of a Denny's type glass. Silver wear is also right out of an institution. 


Pro's:

* Wine list was pretty good, with allot of great wines and reasonably priced too.


I am sure we are going against the grain here with this review, but its simply how we see it. We typically have in our steak house rotation, Mastro's, Ocean Club, Bourbon Steak (Michael Mina's place), and Morton's, this place just isn't in that league. While I will admit we never even got to the dinner, I simply made a judgment call that with all that we had seen up to ordering, the food would not have been that good to over come all the cons. If your a 30, 40's or even 50's couple looking for a hip crowd and great atmosphere, note to self... this aint it.

I am not a huge food critic. To me it is more important to have a great atmosphere, fun hip crowd. I get the whole "oldest power lunch steak house" thing, but eventually even the greats need to earn their keep through something other than their long lived reputation.yes this place has good coffe, but what a bunch of rude pompas asses. I am just saying I am az born and raised from a hardworking family and back round . When I come into an establishment the last thing I need is for some trust fund hipster know it all to twitch his (or her) handle bar mustache at me with an equally annoying hipster stank eye, when I order my (in their opinion ) shitty cup of coffee. Sorry if i did not hash tag an over price thrift store shirt on my twitter , or order my special decoder ring from some homeless want to be spoiled brat to get the latest cool memo from the wonderful lux asshole cafe . But here is just a few tips that might get you a few stars 

1. after you argue with me over an extra shot not being a good idea in your wonderful cup of coffee, dont include yourself in my conversation when I finally get to enjoy it .
Just to  correct me on a subject in a condescending tone that I am actually quite knowledgable about due to heritage and experience .

2. dont give me shit looks and long sighs when I come to the counter .


3.dont correct my opinion of coffee I actually have taken barista courses so maybe you can dip into your hedge fund and go to a couple yourself before you blabber your opinions all over my good day.

4. dont smack your lips and tell the person behind you in a shit sniffing tone mocking my order. 

5. believe it or not before you found your dream job as a barista and wasted all your parents money on a art degree, remember I have worked my ass off to just enjoy one simple cup of coffee with an extra shot , in a fun decorated establishment with a shitty leaf scribble across the foam. So if you gave two shits about the extra dollars I would so eagerly throw into your tip jar, shut the fuck up smile and just say yes would you like anything else? and talk shit about me at the end of your shift like the rest of us.Did you change owners or managers? We used to love this place and visited every time that we were in Phoenix. Well known for the very HOT and delicious food, we were very disappointed on our recent visit. The food was not spicy at all, so much for those who like it hot, which is their logo!! One of our guests was even served a large portion of FAT (more than half of the meat in the meal) in their carnitas, you would have thought that the cooks would have seen this and not served it!! Will not be coming back next time.We are regulars of the Mesa location, always enjoy it. This visit on Central was really disappointing. Party of four stopped last night, the margaritas were great. Both the red and green salsas were really salty, all four commented on that. I thought it may be the chips, it was the salsa. Usually, out of town guests comment on the heat, but the salt was the noticeable flavor. Wife had a chicken burrito. Bite one yielded a bone and lots of water. Not to be confused with juice, it was water. My green chili dinner was mediocre. The beef chunks were large and the chili had not flavored the meat. The meat had been put on the plate, green chili poured over the top. The meat was dry. nothing comparable to the green chili I have had at other locations. Diner three loved the ribs. Diner four ate the flautas, but said they were bland. Typically in Mesa, people love the food and comment on the heat. In this case one loved his ribs, all loved the margaritas. Maybe we hit on a bad night, but most of the passion I have for their hot food was not fulfilled. These salsas were overwhelming with salt, all four of us commented immediately. We are pretty easy to please, have been eating at Ls Dos for years. We will go back to Mesa, but not this location. There were too many negatives, not much on the plus side.Everyone says that you have to take this tour.  What a crock.  While we went on the weekend (Sunday, I think it was), and it is certainly possible that nothing happened on this particular day, I simply cannot imagine that we would have seen much more on a weekday.  There just isn't that much more there.

You go in one side, see a bunch of souvenir junk, go through a simple "tour", then come out to some pricey junk.  You can get the chocolates at M&M world - and see a lot more souvenirs, without taking such a long cab ride.

The cactus garden is nice and all, but it's really not worth it.ok so I was excited and had high hopes that I was eating here, one of many Bobby Flay's signature restuarants around the US.. to tell you the truth it did not deliver for me..

came in with a group of 6 folks mid-day almost dinner walked in no one was seated in the main seating area, the bar was open, we asked for a table and the response from the waitress was "we are not open yet we only have the bar open we dont start serving till sumthing til so and so PM and no we have no tables available"..

Keep in mind the place was empty, literally only the 6 of us and few folks at the bar.. So we sed we would wait at the bar til the restuarant fully opened.. we did so and when the restuarant finally open we were told there was no tables available for us again the restuarant was empty just us and patrons at the bar so we decided to eat at the bar. food was made and delivered quickly, steak was made under par, chicken also made under par for a place of an owner with such caliber we at least though the food would be decent.. sadly food, price, fail, ambiance is only plus everything else FAIL!!

oh if I give them anything, the drinks are made well, other then that go to wolfgang pucks restuarant at least you wont be shunned there by the waitress.

food - * 1/2 & im being nice i could of went to sizzler and got better prepp'd meat
service - negative 5 stars if the waitress dont want to help folks find another job like a pole dancer haha
ambiance **** the place is awesome the look and feel to it, but the service makes the experience all negativeHorrible customer service. Servers were rude and got our order wrong. We will not be going back. The food was decent but not worth the hassle.Horrible place!!!!  Lost $100 in the machines in 5 minutes.  Also, the rooms are Motel 6'ish.  Stay way!!!Having stayed here previously with great experiences I booked a room for our anniversary. At arrival there was quite the line with only 3 employee's working. I found this strange because it was the first hour of check-in. After finally getting checked in we get to the room and my wife started to take a shower so we could go out for the evening. About 5 minutes into the shower the water stops. I call down to the front desk to find out what was going on since my wife was covered in soap. The front desk person was extremely rude for no reason telling me that it's a big hotel and things go wrong. 

I explained that I was just trying to get an estimate on time so my wife could finish her shower. The front desk finally agrees to bring a couple bottles of water so she can at least get the soap off. 45 minutes later we finally get a knock on the door and was handed 2 8oz bottles of water. They said that's all they can give and we'd have to make it work.

Also hotel is located in the sightseeing helicopter flight path resulting in a flyby every 5 minutes or so and the windows are not very sound proof. 

I understand that things break down from time to time but the bad customer service is unacceptable. Will not be staying at NYNY again.There's not much to do at the Las Vegas Hotel that you can't do at other hotels of much better quality. If you're going to stay here, I recommend bringing some food or water of your own or you'll just end up spending an unnecessary amount of money buying them. My room seemed really old, especially the bathroom! My entire hall also smelled like weed... At least the lady behind the concierge desk was helpful in showing us things we could do. If you're going to stay at a hotel in Las Vegas, you might as well choose a better and more interesting hotel.This place *looks* like a nice hotel, but is full of what we called "shitty little touches" that belie the real story. All facade.

Our bathmat had cigarette burns in it. There was candle wax dripped all over our table that no one had cleaned off. The "luxurious" spa menu was wet from the last guests in the room. Lotion in the shower instead of hair conditioner. (Found that out the hard way.)

And my personal highlight? Raw sewage burbling up through the marble sink all morning yesterday. Yep. My suite literally smelled like shit and it was too late to do anything about it or move since we were packing up to leave. We just had to deal. Disgusting. And no, the front desk did nothing about it to make me feel better when we told them.nice casino. bad service. i tried to get drink at the bar and they ignored me for several minutes. eventually i just walked away.The traditional New Orleans Gumbo was tasteless, the lobster bisque was too salty, the jumbo lump crab salad was anything but fresh, the BBQ shrimp was swimming in BBQ sauce......, we were amazed by the poor quality of food this restaurant serves, we ordered great wine and that's the only thing we finished, service was O.K.  I would skip this restaurant altogether.OMG THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!

so they don't have the room i reserved and they move me to a really noisey room next to the elevator...then to a room that looked like a jail cell...then to a room with someone already in it...then to a room with water damage to the curtains.

(i am soooo not picky at all but the rooms they sent us to were awful)

then on the last night my room flooded and they wouldn't tell me what caused it and didn't change my room so i had to walk around with my shoes on.

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

the rooms are really big compared to other hotels i've been to...but i'm still never going to stay there again.All I have to say is BED BUGS!  We had 3 people in the room and all three of us were bit several times.  I called and filed a report with security, although he was polite he did not offer an apology which was disconcerning.  As often as I come to Vegas I will NOT be staying here again nor will I refer people to stay here. One other complaint, however small, the towels were like sandpaper, very rough.The steakhouse sucks and the service is horrible.I have never met a more rude hostess in my life!!!My Sister-in-law got married and as we were staying in the Monte Carlo I suggested having a small reception dinner at Andre's because the concierge at the hotel said it was excellent.  We were a party of 6 and were having a very nice time until the staff pulled a real dirty fast one on me.  I swear if it hadn't been for this one greedy move I would be writing an excellent review right now.  A couple that were sitting behind us at another table offered to buy our table a bottle of champagne and we ordered a bottle of Veuve Clicquot.  We thanked them for such a nice gesture and went on with our meal.  When I got the bill I noticed that I was being charged for the Veuve Clicquot and when I questioned it I was handed a cheap bottle of Andre's Champagne and told that this was what the other patron had bought us and that the Veuve Clicquot was not the bottle that he had bought so I had to pay for it!  So my question to the waiter was then why was the Veuve Clicquot poured to me and my guests and not the Andre crap?  Why wasn't I told? I ordered the Veuve Clicquot right in front of the man who was buying the Champagne and he smiled and nodded and said "enjoy!" The lie that the waiter was telling me was one of the dirtiest things that has ever happened to me in any restaurant ever in my life.  I couldn't believe it.  I asked to see the manager and he somehow was not available.  So I held my anger, paid the bill took my "crap" bottle of Andre Champagne and left.  Did I look like an idiot tourist?  They sure treated me like one.  So for the rest of my life I will trash this lousy restaurant instead of praising it.Oh the Luxor.....
Last August my four girlfriends and I went on an extravagant and very memorable Vegas trip.  Our 5 day. 4 night trip was through this fantastic package deal which included day and night activities and accommodations at the Palazzo (a newer and fabulous hotel that is connected to the Venetian and I would highly recommend).  

Unfortunately, two of my girlfriends had procrastinated on booking their flights to Vegas until a few weeks before and with all of the popular airlines prices having skyrocketed, they found themselves drawn to the seemingly good deals of the underwhelming Stockton Airport's lone airline "Allegiant" which offers sporadic flights to Vegas for roughly $50 in planes the size of crop dusters.  The catch- they would have to stay an extra night in Vegas to catch a flight out.  In a further attempt to save money, the two lovable procrastinators decided to find a cheap hotel to rest their hungover heads in for their extra night in Vegas.....in comes the Luxor.  

My little procrastinators were pretty proud of themselves for figuring out how to save their pennies right up until the point that my non-procrastinator friend and I walked them into the Lobby and helped them settle into their evening at the hotel before thankfully taking our plane home.  The Luxor reminds me of of cheap vodka- take Svedka for example.  Sure, from the outside it looks just as good as all the other vodkas.  It's in a glass bottled (not plastic!), it seems to have it's own character and vibe going on, it's clear ...but once you open the bottle and experience what's inside you realize it's just crap and you feel like a total creep for buying into it.  That, my friends, is the  experience of staying at the Luxor.  

Once inside, you feel like you're on a ride at Disneyland as the Luxor is something of a cross between "Mr. Toad's Wild Adventure" and "The Tower of Terror".  Almost everyone staying at the Luxor is really foreign or just really trashy.  The entire decor is plastic, artificial, or falling apart.  Between the pom trees and the giant plaster of paris Sphinx in the center of the lobby, it's almost like the haggard hotel is pathetically begging you to believe, "No this is not a shit hotel, You're in EGYPTTTTT". 

But on to the best part....on the way up to the elevator, the elevator attendant (were I use the word creepy to describe him, it wouldn't be fitting enough.  Let's just say if he had been missing an arm and been a ghost, I would have believed it), clad in a faded, teal bellhop suit asked us which floor.  When we replied "35", he replied dryly, "we've had a lot of jumpers from that floor".  Aghast, we asked him how many people have jumped and he said, "7 so far this summer".  When the elevator doors opened and we saw the accommodations, we realized why.  

Not only are the rooms a shabby disgrace, (my girlfriend later confessed to me that she slept with her sweats with her hood over her head and her socks tucked into the bottom of her pants), but the pyramid shape of the building makes walking down the hall extremely dangerous as the overlook from your floor to the lobby is only about waist-high and after a night of drinking could be difficult NOT to tip over off of.  I began to wonder if those jumpers had actually meant to jump, or had simply toppled over the wall.  

In the end, my non-Luxor patron friend and I joyfully skipped off to grab our flight leaving our poor procrastinator friends to think about their folly.  We were gracious enough however to leave our laughter and "told you so's" until they got home.  No need to kick someone when they're down.  The moral of the story- stay away from the LuxorWe showed up and they didn't have our Travelocity reservation that was made two weeks prior and told us they were completely booked.  After calling Travelocity while waiting at the counter, they were able to get us one of our rooms, then they realized we had booked two, so we had to go through the whole process over again.  After spending AN HOUR at the counter, they were able to get rooms for us.

Upon entering our room, a man from inside comes running at the door, scaring all of us.  THEY GAVE US AN ACTIVE KEY FOR A ROOM THAT ALREADY HAD SOMEONE CHECKED INTO IT.  I made the long trek back down to registration and had informed them of their latest mess up.  They finally gave me an upgraded suite that didn't have anybody in it, but we slept with one eye open hoping nobody would enter our room.

Upon check out it took another HOUR to check out, I'm not kidding, because they couldn't find my info in their system AGAIN.  So I wasted about 3 hours dealing with trying to get the rooms that I had booked 2 weeks in advance, wasting much of our vacation time.  The staff was extremely rude as well, insisting that it was Travelocity's fault even though THEY do things like put people in rooms where others are already staying.  Other people next to me at registration were complaining about things like their rooms not having been cleaned upon their check in.  This place seriously sucks.  The pyramid rooms are junky as well and falling apart.  They waived their BS "resort fee" ($30) that they charge you on top of your reservation, but it's obvious that THEY SIMPLY DO NOT CARE at this hotel when I was telling them what I had to deal with.  My 60 year old mother was in tears on her first ever trip to Las Vegas.I went a few weeks ago and the water in my bathroom quit running at midnight and when I called downstairs I was transferred and then no one was sent to my room. It was out for six hours. When I had gone down to the front desk to explain that not only had my water been off but I found hair in my bed and the trash was emptied when we got there, the man didnt make eye contact, grumbled that he was sorry for the incovinience and that he would take the $24 resort fee off. Oh and then when I emailed to complain they sent me an email back saying my next trip will be guaranteed the lowest price...Ugh priceline does that.
Horrible place. Many of the front desk workers hate being there and you can tell. If you're not going to spend the money to be in a penthouse don't waste your time here they treat you like $h!t otherwise.From the outside, Luxor looks like a really cool place to stay, with it's beam of light looking like its shining into space, and cool statues. Once going inside, the whole hotel smells like a vanilla/coconut bathroom air freshener factory. It's all bad.

+1 star for the nice front desk guy pointing us to the right elevator to go up.
Speaking of elevators, the ones here are terrifying. They're old and rock back and forth, they make their own rules too. We were heading down from the 10th floor once, we hit the button to go down to the lobby, but the elevator decided, nope, were gonna go up to get more people!

Our rooms were the worst. They must have steam cleaned the rooms the same day because walking in, the air was damp, the sheets were damp, and our socks were wet from walking on the carpet. The windows were filthy, like they hadn't been cleaned in ages.

I know the whole "you get what you pay for" thing and I'm not one to be picky about hotels/motels but this stay was dreadful.My first thought is that I would never go back to this establishment given all of the choices in this price range, Picasso just downstairs is far superior.  We started with drinks at the bar, the bartender was friendly and we thought we were going to have a great evening.  

The décor is fabulous and so much fun, too bad the wait staff seemed grumpy and put out to be there.  Our table was small and on a crowded wall, it felt more like a bistro table than a fine dining experience.  I don't know why they sat 3 couples in a row on this wall given that there were other open tables that were never filled while were dined.  

We opted for the full tasting menu and the highlights were the amuse bouche and the cheese plate.  Nothing stood out and I was most disappointed by the signature sea bass, it was kind of dry.  While I don't expect to love everything on a tasting menu I expect at least one standout dish that blows my mind.  Not a single standout.

The service was terrible, don't know if we just got the B team or what but it was just off, here are some examples:

- waiters calling out to each other across the room
- the servers standing at our table waiting to put down our dishes because no one came around with new silverware
- a lovely fork with bent prongs

I've never had such cold service in my life and I do a lot of fine dining.  I'm sticking with Michael Mina and Picasso next time I'm at the Bellagio.This place is a huge waste of the space they managed to acquire. 

The one and only experience I had here was an all expenses paid work celebration happy hour, and it took all the good-humor I have in my body to have a decent time. It was hard just to stop myself from throwing bottles and stale chips at the staff and other patrons. 

The happy hour was arranged because it was one of the members of our social team's favorite bars. They spent THOUSANDS of dollars to hold an event with a couple of free drinks and some vats of appetizers. All the food was a step down from Applebees at prices that would make even Matt Leinart cry. And the brew selection is absolutely abysmal and has no taps.

I don't understand what it is that drives Scottsdalites to blow a mortgage payment's worth of money each month on hang outs like this with nothing to do but stare at each other with awful domestic bottled beer and frozen Costco appetizers.

The evening only became notable for how beligerant I was able to get from hefty doses of gin and tonic to where I invented some drinking games that involved tossing their crap food around their tables in a bean-bag toss type game. I don't think we will be invited back and I am confident I don't care.The buffets at the casinos in Oregon have spoiled me. All of the food at Spice Market was either bland or blatantly over-salted. Puhlease. The seafood was a joke.O.k me and my buddies went to this place last Saturday night on 4th of July and all I can say is this place is a total Mess. The Bouncers were Rude and Obnoxious, they don't treat the people there as customers, yes it was crowded and yes there was allot of people but the bottom line is if you're not VIP or 5 Hot Girls, you'll never get in this club. I guess you have to Bribe the Bouncers so they can get you in or Buy $500.00 bottle that's only worth $35.00 at Ralphs so you can get in this place. What nerve these people have, Total waste of my Night..I hope the whole Universe never go to this Club. Trust me you will thank me in the end.I absolutely HATE this place

All my friends hyped up this place and said "Its the best club in Vegas, you will have to much fun!" NOT REALLY. It was the worst night of my life! (and this is being nice) Thanks a lot friends! =P

I give it 1 star only because of 1 and 2 below but give me a reason to bump up these stars because I will not set foot up here again unless dragged by my best friends.....only if I don't send them to XS first.

YES I got in for free with my friends promoter
YES I got free drinks before 11
YES it was hella crackin' 
YES I got my foot stepped on every 5 sec
YES the dance floor is small
YES I could feel the sweat of the person next to me
YES there were hella stairs
YES Hella confusing once inside
YES there is no where you can chill for a min
YES the balcony is just as crowed as the dance floor
YES the bar floor is hella wet because of the spilled drinks
YES the it was hard to get the bar tenors attention
YES I recommend you not to go here!

Note: I came here on New years Day, this may have cause the unfortunate events to occur to have this horrible experience. Like I said give me a reason to bump up my stars a promoter, more free drinks, comp dinner? (I wish) but for now my 1 star staysI hate this club SO much.  It is the sweatiest, nastiest, most overcrowded place ever.  After you actually get in to the club, trying to get to the dance floor involves going up stairs that are so crowded you move one step at a time completely surrounded by sweaty bodies.  The dance floor is way too small and it is impossible to dance, let alone even move.  All you really do is just stand there smashed up against other people, getting stepped on with stilettos, getting elbowed, getting pushed, getting your dress caught on other girls' jewelry, and getting other people's sweat on you.  SO disgusting.  People say the bathrooms are cool, but they are not even clean!  The way the door fogs up when you lock it is unique, but they have to have a guy check each stall before you go in to make sure people didn't do who knows what in there.  ugh.  hate this place.I dont usually write reviews on clubs unless I either really like them, or want to warn people not to go. In this case Id definitely like to give people a heads up before they waste anytime at this spot. 

I think TAO is probably one of the most overrated clubs on the strip, its super mainstream so everyone knows about it, and because of it everyone and their mom tries to go, AND gets in.

We got there fairly early, just before 12 spent a few mins upstairs at the bar over by the restrooms, just to get a good buzz going. But soon the club began to pack, and we realized our little spot would be the place to stay and dance for most of the night.

First off the club gets obnoxiously packed, to the point you are weaving and dodging people if or when we want to get anywhere. If you want to go to the restroom good luck, the restrooms are located next to the bar and are connected to a smaller space that connects to the back part of the club. It was a nightmare to get through or just exit, security yelling, people standing trying order drinks, trying to use the bathroom, trying to move or exit, a complete mess.

Then if you try and go on the main dance floor, its a joke, they pack you so close you literally have NO personal space, you have someone in back of you, next to you in, front of you. You literally are jumping up and down to the beat because you cant really dance. Security stands at the entrances to the dance floor so as soon as the floor packs, they will deny anyone entry.

We headed to one of the other floors, which was a mission within itself (again to many people), and when arriving were met with the same obstacles as the main floor.  

If you are visiting and want to make this one of the clubs you are hopping around to before you hit another club (you got a deal/promotion etc.), by all means go to it. But don't make this your one stop club destination for the night because you will be disappointed. 

I love to party, dance and enjoy myself in a great (semi-spacious) atmosphere, TAO will definitely not be on my itinerary whenever I party in Vegas. Ever.Ok, so you know how family is important to me? Well, if you didn't you do now. We, my niece and I, spent six days total at the Wynn. It was her birthday. We requested (from the concierge) a great table with a view. My partner flew in for the occasion. We were told 9:30 was a good time. We knew to schedule and plan. We showed up at 9:30 ready to go. We were told to wait for a table.  45 minutes later we were ushered to the very back near the kitchen. Do you eat at 10:30? I don't. What would you do? What could I do? How about just be humiliated? Talked to the hotel manager. He said he'd look into it.  Wow,  hotel manager offers Allegro as a compromise. Really?  A walk in bar off the gaming tables at 10:30 at night.  Thanks Steve Wynn, great staff, great experience.Seats...my highschool gym seats were more comfortable than these.. Also we sat on the front left row... Expect to get wet... Which isn't cool when your in a suit..
Also clown acts.... Horrible !,  the zebra looking dude.. Do something already ! And the actor that probably gets 100k for having his arm behind his neck... Can you have a more useless character ? I know this show is hyped everywhere... I'd recommend skipping it... Go see la reve. That's a great show.The restaurant reeked of cleaning chemicals and gave me and all my friends headaches.

Brunch buffet options were scrambled eggs, hash browns, pancakes, a fruit plate, pastries, and an omelet station. In short, the exact opposite of what you go to a Vegas buffet for.

 For essentially the same price you could have gone to the Wicked Spoon instead - that place was fantastic.

TLDR - compensates for a pathetic buffet by making you feel too sick to eat.The guys at the door have a stick up their ass.  8 cute girls? wait in line? oh- hell no, we had a better time at Pure.I came here on a Thursday night. 

3 guys for every girl. If I was gay, I probably would've rated this place at 11 stars. But I'm not. So you lose 10 stars.I reserved a room on the Plaza's website and got a great deal...or so I thought...they will nickel and dime you, tell you that they'll refund the 'deposit' you have to pay, that they don't tell you about until you're already standing in front of them, and then end up charging you incorrectly. I called and was told that it was MY mistake and that the printout from their website was in error, and therefore I was in error and there was nothing they were going to do about it. 

So I can do something about it...never stay with them again...AND...tell everyone about my horrid experience.

Also, in the room, there were unknown pills left under the sink from previous guest(thank goodness I didn't have small children with me) AND the ceiling had what looked like food caked into it, like someone had a food fight and no one cleaned the ceiling.
BEWARE!!Did you get into a fight with your spouse?  Upset with a friend who stole the gal you planned on asking out for a date?  Want to ensure revenge via fast-acting gut bomb?

Take him (or her) to Corsa for an overpriced meal that will, literally, *leave* him (or her) in pain.  The only excuse for the Vegas-high price of food here is the need to cover the cost of all the salt they must use in preparing the food.

My first bite of fried calamari was like emptying a salt shaker in my mouth.  Bravely, I continued on with the mushroom-salt paste pizzetta and a so-so dish of rich mashed potatoes.  Veal parmigiana was as good as Buca di Beppo's, which is not saying much IMHO, and the short rib rigatoni was heavy on the fat (oh, and did I mention the ragu was salty?).

If I could give this place minus stars, I would.  If you must stop here and waste your money, then hit the bar for a decent Bloody Mary or glass of wine.  These were the only good items any of the three of us had that night.   Even the blood-orange mojito was overly sweet.  (Ha-ha, gotcha!  No, it was not salty.)

P.S. -- Tell your unfortunate spouse or friend to drink plenty of water and plan for a night of no sleep (since the bathroom is not a very comfortable room in which to sleep).NOT hilarious! what a waste of $$$ and time!Where do I start? What a waste of money, TIME, and a night of our Vegas vacation. The entire show from the beginning to the end was a complete disappointment. It was way too immature and boring- even for children. I enjoy the drums but this was just a lame show that I honestly would strongly discourage anyone from going to this show.Dan Dan Noodles were horrible and Shanghai Noodles were mediocre at best.  Both dishes had very little meat.  Pass on this place.Advice? Do not go here. I wish I could put 0 stars. Service is so bad, the servers look like they are miserable with their lives. I also ordered shrimp tempura and fried calamari for appetizers and it tastes like the one you get from Costco boxes. Food got to me so cold..Went with a group of 8 for steak and eggs night...waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpriced! and for such a small and thin looking piece of steak. Can you say rip off! The cafe wasn't even half full and they mixed up my order with another person in our party, they ordered med-rare and i ordered med...why can' t service be more accurate with their details on orders? Was serving our group really too much for them to handle? Have you seen other cafes?  Head over to one of the $5 or less steak and egg spots...the service and quality are far more superior.  Pricier does not always mean better.
Never again.Wow.  Worst service ever.  Raffles is, unfortunately, the only coffee shop/cafe open 24hrs in the Mandalay/Luxor/Excalibur cluster.  Since my friends and I were staying at the Luxor, it was 1am, and we were hungry, we ate here after an evening of gambling. I know I've eaten at Raffles before and it was fine, but not this time. We were seated quickly and the waitress took our orders. The price range was pretty high for a Vegas cafe late night menu, but it's the Strip, so whatever.  She delivered our drinks and then our food. It was mediocre at best.  Then, she pulled a David Copperfield and disappeared for the rest of our meal.  We kinda wanted refills on our waters and $4 Pepsi's, but no server and none of the other employees looked twice at us. We waited forever for the check and when it arrived my grilled cheese was rung up as a $13 chicken noodle soup with (grilled cheese $6.50) underneath.  I asked and she said she had to ring it up that way because there was no button for the grilled cheese sandwich. Whaaaa???? I said, "so it's $6.50?" "No, $13"--then she took off again.  We paid our bill, reluctantly gave her a 10% tip and left. And told everyone entering to run away. Quickly.  Oh yeah...and we took all the pens she brought to sign the credit card slips.

The next day, we wanted breakfast and Raffles was the only option.  We took a cab downtown and went to the Golden Nugget where the cafe is always awesome and service is always great.

UPDATE: Reading the review below, I see now that there was a grilled cheese chicken noodle soup combo.  That combo was not listed on the menu I had, but I guess that's what I ordered? FAIL.Went here at 11:30 and noone was here music was wack my friends and I was having a full convo  in the club because the music wasnt even that loud .. to be honest if I can here my friends talk from a distance u know is bad.. dont come here so glad I was on the guess list because they charge ppl 20$ if u dont live in las vegas..Absolutely one of the worst restaurants I've been too. I used to go to the location at Tatum and Cactus which I enjoyed quiet a bit. My son, husband, mother, and I stopped by for lunch on Labor Day. First off the place is tiny, the service is terrible, and the food is decent. It took forever to get any service at all, after which we were seated basically in the doorway, it's silly and uncomfortable. Next we ordered my sons kid meal was brought out about 15 minutes before the rest of our lunch. My mom had a white sangria cocktail which was basically just orange juice, which I have never actually seen anyone put orange juice in white sangria before. My husband ordered the chicken sandwich was basically plain chicken on a bun with a half a head of lettuce, tomato and onion..yep that is really all. The french fries were somehow both burned and undercooked...not sure how that even happens. Finally it came time to pay our bill it came to about $33 which is completely reasonable. I paid with a $50 and was brought my change entirely in ones. This to me is absolutely ridiculous and rude Also I saw the waiter use the money from his wallet (his tips I assume) to make the change which to me is totally unacceptable, you don't bring your wallet out at anytime you're handling customers cash.

Basically you could not pay me to return to this place."Poop"ovich.. more like it. This was a disappointing show. Not only was the production a sleeper, the theater had a creepy, low budget feel to it. Coupled with a really strange cast of what appeared to be a bunch of drunken Russian men barely able to contain a lot of hungry stray cats. I think their 'saving animals from the shelter story' holds no water. Even if its true, these poor animals are forced into slavery, I'm ashamed I even paid to support it.

And if that's not enough, we were also duped into 'upgrading our tickets' for $10 more per ticket. The box office guy is a trained conman stating that 'without the upgrade our seating would begin at the 14th row...' Meanwhile there's only 11 rows total in their shady ass theater. Ugh. Bad entertainment choice and shame on the  V Theater employees.Poor service, starting with the incompetent, rude and narcissistic young woman who receives you, or not. Happy hour is poorly managed. I live in the area but prefer to drive away to a more welcoming place.  Is there a manager here? Will never return.I don't know why everyone gives the store in Tempe a good review. I just went today to make a simple purchase of a table and chair for my grandson and it was a nightmare. I have never liked the layout of IKEA, finding it confusing and illogical. Sure enough I was trying to find the children's section. No signs, and no sign of anyone work working on the floor. I wander around and finally find it, pick out what I want and get a shopping cart. That's where I hit my first major snag. The cart doesn't wheel right. It goes all over the place. I decide to ditch it and get one in self service figuring they have to have them there also. Of course they don't because that would be logical. I happen upon one that was left there and guess what? That one also doesn't wheel right. Like the other one it wheels all over the place. I can barely control it. I press on tho to get my items and can't find one of them but there are workers there so I ask one about the missing item. He has to call someone in that dept. Really? You can't just help me find the right bin? While I'm waiting I find the item myself and struggle to get the cart to one of only two cashiers working. To get the sale price of my items, I find out I have to belong to the IKEA family. At this point I don't want to belong to this moronic family but I want my discount. I'm told I have to join at the kiosk. Its pointed out to me by a worker running from me. Nice. I can't get the kiosk to work. No help around now. Another customer asks the cashier who gives us forms to fill  out to get the card. Apparently after you go to the kiosk you have to fill out this paperwork for the card anyway. Huh? And why didn't the cashier tell me that in the first place? I'm now beginning to suspect the workers are sadists who like to see us suffer.
I purchase my items but now I have to figure out how to get my uncontrollable cart out of the store and to my car. I find that heaving the cart away from me gets it to move the most feet. I crash it into a wine rack. I don't care there are no workers around anyway. I heave it some more and manage to get it out the door to my car. It took me an hour and a half to purchase a simple table and chair. I don't plan on visiting my new 'family' ever again.It was 3am in the morning and we came here based on yelp reviews.

UGGHHH the cutlery was dirty. A stringy white thing (kinda looked like a thin cheese string) was hanging from my friend's fork. My utensils hard some crustiness on them too (see photo).

I wouldn't expect this from the Bellagio. Won't be back.My recent stay was horrible, they want $175 (+tax) per night while majority of near by hotels were under $100 night. This is not really a hotel, it's a timeshare business that Marriott is a part of (or the other way around?) so the hotel function isn't really the main focus. It is nice to have kitchen and living room, but quality of service is bare born. 

First, hotel portion is totally understaffed...since my last stay a yer ago, hotel has downsized significantly. One person behind the check in, one person working for room service (yes! For such a huge hotel!) 

What pissed me off the most was the poor concierge  desk guy with really cruel attitude. I guess that's Vegas? 

Despite close proximity to the strip, cabs aren't lined up, inconvenient and valet guys are always pushing for private black limo (they charge x2~3 of city cab for exact same route)

I thought this was good for biz travel but I changed my mind after recent trip, avoid this scam hotel wanna be at all cost...So far, my worst Chinese food experience ever! My mistake though, as I should have known better when I entered the restaurant. Atrocious decor, no one to greet me, and only a couple eating there. But I was craving for Asian food, and this place was right next to my hotel. I ordered egg rolls + Orange chicken (which came with steamed rice). The rolls were so greasy that I truly started to feel nauseous. The worst was the Orange chicken. In my book, the chicken has to be tender inside and crispy on the outside... Well, it was literally dried! I almost choked on it! When the waitress took away the half full dishes, she did not bother ask me if everything was fine... She knew better! Thank God for the fortune cookie as it was the only good food I had there!We went to wildfish last night for my husbands birthday with our two teenaged kids. The service was terrible. Although they kept coming to check on us - it took an hour for our food to arrive. One of our appetizers (Fuji salad) had chunks of ice In it. When we showed a server, he explained that they keep the plates in a freezer. Then with his bare hands he lifted the ice off, which them broke back into the salad. He continued to try to fish the ice out with his hands. He then took the plate away - Blech. The food was fair - I remember it being much better. One of the managers kept checking on us - but did nothing to make amends for the awful service.  Definitely wont be back.Tao is completely over hyped. It's nicely decorated and the people working at Tao are all very pretty. The DJ is even great. But the food is awful and the entire meal felt rushed. I felt like the waiters were really trying to turn the tables over quickly. The waiter even took my cocktail and didn't ask if I wanted another. This also happened with the food. But that's not even the worst part. The worst part was the actual food. Maybe I'm spoiled, living in the Bay Area. We have so much great Asian food. Tao just couldn't compare. Not even close. I understand it's Asian fusion, but it just did not taste good.

The appetizers were OK. We had lobster wontons, the tuna tartar, and the chicken dumplings. Of course these were fine, how can you screw up a dumpling. For dinner we had sushi and it was some of the fishiest we've ever had. Just awful. We also had the miso glazed Chilean Sea Bass and it was tasty but I think it was undercooked. About a half hour after eating it, I got really sick. We kicked down like $150+ for dinner and it was as if I hadn't even eaten it. It honestly could have been anything I ate there that made me sick, but I really think it was the sea bass. 

We even had plans to go to the nightclub afterwards but we had such a terrible dinner we wanted to get the hell out of there. We ended up at the Palms. Avoid Tao. It's just not worth it.I love animals and we are regular visitors locals zoos and our marine wildlife park, so maybe that is why I wasn't impressed with this attraction.  They have three dolphin pools - two for training and one mother/baby pool.  It's basically a trainer talking in a microphone the whole time while you watch those that paid for the trainer program feed and tell the dolphins to do tricks.   There are no schedules, so you are moving from pool to pool in order to see the dolphins.  Also, there is a very small amount of shade around the pools so bring sunscreen and be prepared to stand directly in the Las Vegas sun!  They do have underground viewing for the dolphins as well.  The mother/baby pool was the best part for me as it was fun to see the babies swimming alongside their mother.  Don't come here expecting to see a choreographed show as they don't do this here.  They are trying to keep them as "natural" as possible which I think is the best thing they can do for dolphins in captivity.  

The big cat exhibit was a big letdown.  They have two white tigers, two black panthers and two lions in what appears to be small enclosures.  They are doing some construction to either make the place bigger or for new animals.  We went at around noon and every single cat was sleeping.  The most exciting thing for the three kids in our group was the Fountain of Longevity in this area.  They had more fun splashing in the water than watching the tigers or dolphins.

The snack bar is way overpriced as I spent over $11 for three Slurpee drinks.  The gift shop has many overpriced things as well ($36 for a stuffed animal).  I know it's Vegas, but after paying $75 for 3 adults & 1 child to get in, I had spent enough on this exhibit.  Heck, the MGM lion habitat (that is sadly no longer there) was more entertaining than this place.  My tip - save your time and money, this one is a bust!I cannot imagine how anyone gives this place a good rating. I went to get a bagel. They told me X/Y/Z bagels were out and I only had a certain choice. I pay, get into the next line. All the people in front of me that ordered the same thing, didn't get the correct bagels b/c the cashiers all told the wrong thing. Then they skipped me and I just stood there for 5 mins while everyone after me got food. Then they gave me the wrong bagel (of the remaining ones "available").We had sunday lunch here a few months ago.. I remember it like yesterday and i'd rather not. Nothing else in the Mandalay Bay appealed to me. Everything seemed so fancy and overpriced. Nothing called to me except this place. Eek. I was wrong. There were lots of meat dishes, few veggies besides the salad bar. lots of breads and even more desserts. I liked that they had sugar free options, that was nice, but neither SF nor regular desserts tasted very good, but it was pretty... just very pretty and bland. Seemed almost to have no taste? hmmm. I would not go back.  My bf went again recently but he coudlnt remember if he'd had it before..but he came home and said he'd eaten at a place that was horrible @ the Mandalay Bay. When we went to the strip recently on a fight night we parked @ Mandalay Bay b/c MGM was super packed and didnt even want to risk trying to find parking there and he recognized it like a becon in the night! "That's It!, That's the place that I ate @ that was horrible!" ....heck even Sam;s club and the Orleans had better food for much cheaper prices.The first time was great. The next 3 visits a disaster! Food has gone way down in quality. Horrible steak on visit #2 and the clams got us sick on our last visit. Not to mention the lack of attention from the waiter. At the prices they charge the service should be fabulous and friendly. That it was not!  If you must...the calamari and the meatballs are good.I thought this was a decent sports bar, so I met my husband and some friends here for lunch on the Friday of the first round of the NCAA tournament. We were the only table of people inside and there were maybe 10 other people in the entire place. Including an handful of old (50+) men that hugged all of the waitresses WAY too long. They lingered.
Anyway, our server was awful. I've been a server at different points in my life, and I have no problem calling out the ones that suck. She was worthless. No one got water more than once and the drinks sat empty for 15-20 minutes at time. 
The food was pathetic. I'm 6.5 months pregnant and will eat just about anything you put in front of me...but I didn't want to eat any of the tacos I ordered. $12 for three TINY tacos that had zero meat on the inside and what little food there was in them tasted like crud. Also, apparently the dish comes with rice and beans...which come on their own gigantic plate. Since no one ate theirs, because it was so bad, the plates of rice and beans sat there the entire time we were there. Even after our other plates were cleared, the freaking beans and rice would not go away. She just kept leaving them there, apparently in case we got some cravings for black beans with beers, after the beans had been sitting there for half an hour.
After waiting for 20 minutes or so just to see our server to get our check, we finally just went to the bar to pay. When our server returned with our cards, she apologized that she wasn't around. She said she'd told her boss that she felt like she was getting sick and thought he was going to take care of the check. Super glad this one was serving us drinks and food all afternoon, especially to a pregnant chick, if she feels like crap.
That was the first and last time I'll ever go there. Way too many great places in this area to get great food from servers who aren't going to give you herpes. Which is what I'm 99% sure she was coming down with.This place came recommended highly by someone I met at a near-by raw food restaurant, although I'm not sure how or why anyone would recommend this place.

We showed up to the yoga studio in plenty of time for class to start only to find we were late for a class that was just beginning. They guy at the front desk informed us that the online schedule was either for the previous or following week. ((I don't remember which one??!))

I've never experienced a yoga studio more stinky than this one - and I've been to plenty of hot yoga studios. Why does this place smell so bad???

The yoga mats this place provided were disgusting -- I'm still in disbelief that I actually used one.

The studio looks old and outdated -- it did not feel clean at all. I would definitely not walk around barefoot or naked in the locker rooms. 

I am not new to yoga, but a friend of mine that was with me was new. The instructor never once came over to help re-position her into the correct stances. Disappointing. 

The instructors looked out of shape - major turn off.

I would never go back to this place. 

I'll never forget that stench.Holy eff I am gonna get started writing a review about this shit hole. Do not waste your time on this palce. Everytime you ask for something it is like a problem.Had dinner there last night 07/27/2013 at 7 pm. I ordered a Cesar salad, was greatly disappointed because the so called garlic toasts were not fresh. Feels like eating an overnight toast. Then, I had the bone-in rib eye ordered to cook medium but, it was more like raw.  They tend to over flood us with the sides like going to a Denny's.  my girl friend had their burger and it was not cooked to her liking.  She ordered well done but got raw too. Very disappointed and will not be going back ever again.Worst meal ever. 

I was in town visiting my parents over the winter holiday and we stopped in for dinner here. Service was horrible. My parents are older so we went in early (around 5pm). Most of the staff looked hung-over and treated us as though they hadn't clocked in yet. I thought it best to play it safe and ordered the chicken taco's. They were flavorless for the most part, but with an overpowering cilantro aftertaste that didn't balance. I had a bite of my father's fish - which was okay, but by no means anything more than standard fare. Their entire menu lacked imagination and I begrudgingly sat through the meal hoping to leave soon. About 24 hours later (on Christmas Eve) I came down with a wrenching case of salmonella poisoning. My mother (who had a bite of my chicken taco) followed shortly after and it was a Christmas filled with memories of vomiting and diarrhea. So much so, we didn't get around to opening any presents until just before I left for my flight home.

When I did arrive home I weighed myself at ten pounds lighter (if that gives you a sense of volume) and determined never to be shy about sending food back.My wife and I ate there this evening.  We used to love this place.  The service used to be so so, but now it is just terrible.  The carne asada tacos were my favorite item on the menu, but I think they misunderstood me when I ordered and gave me the carne ASSada tacos.  Almost flavorless.

We were never given chips and salsa, even after we requested chips and salsa.  My margarita was terrible.  They must have misunderstood me again and thought I wanted a virgin margarita.  I think we were getting poor service and weak drinks because we weren't gaming.

It looks like Agave is owned by the same group that owns the Roadrunner bars.  The Roadrunner corporate "chefs" must have gotten ahold of the original recipes and "optimized" them for profitability.

We have removed Agave from our list of restaurants that we will eat at.I can't quite figure out why, but I've just never liked this place. Gave it three tries, and just didn't click. The cover charge irritated me... $5 to get into an empty room? Really?... the crowd seemed to consist of groups of 4-5 people who didn't talk to anyone but the other 3-4 people in their group... and the drinks were expensive. Somehow left in a bad mood every time I went there, and walked up the street to Amsterdam. I was SO excited for another venue to open up, and was really thinking that I would love it... but... no... just not feelin' it at all. Too much attitude for the new kids on the block.Fell sick the next day. Ruined Vegas tripWe were so looking forward to having a neighborhood Sushi place to go to.  Service was good however the sushi was average and way over priced.  We had two hand rolls, two sushi rolls and not alcohol.  The rolls did not have an abundance amount of sushi but the price tag was $75.00 for our order.  For this I would have gone to Ocean Club!  Probably will not be going back.Sooooo thoroughly disappointed with this place. For an expensive place, you'd think the quality of fish would be good. I paid 3 times more than what I did in LA the week prior for way worse crap. Fish was not fresh tasting at all. I seriously think this place is worse than any AYCE place I've been to in Vegas. The sashimi platter is a waste of money. For $35 I got premium cuts of fish in LA. I do expect to pay more in Vegas. But with paying more, I expect to get good quality food. Sadly this is not what I got.Feeneys, you win. I really tried to like the place. We've been there four times. Cheap burgers on Mondays, who can resist? Welll, I now can. How hard is it to cook a hamburger? Apparently impossible. Four times we have ordered both of our hamburgers with little or no pink, and five times (we sent one back twice!) they have come back bloody. Tonight, they returned it on the same bloody bun.  Feeneys, PLEASE teach your cooks what well done means! Fully cooked doesn't mean cinders, but it does mean NO PINK! 

The staff is generally friendly and welcoming. Drinks are only fair. The salad bar is great. I give a lot of leeway because I really love small, local restaurants. But really, if you consistently can't cook a hamburger to customer specifications, I can't keep going.um, is no star an option? this place was so beyond terrible it's humorous. have you ever been to Rocky Point? you know, where they outfit their bars on a shoestring budget of $80, place cheesy plastic beer flags everywhere and have lights that point down at the floor and move jerkily back and forth seemingly in an effort to make you dizzy?

yeah...that's this place. like a time and physical warp to spring break rocky point circa '99 --- ow, ow!!!

not to worry, I'm sure it will be something else in about six months anyway. it was bar/band venue for a second, then it was PA Connection... (wait, why does Tempe need a connection to Pennsylvania??) and now it's the Coconut Club. maybe their trying to channel the success (for lack of a better word) of Margarita Rocks with that name, but it all spells greasy dudes with bad lines and bad music.DISLIKE.

Normally I fly southwest - for some odd reason US airways this past time was the better deal. NEVER AGAIN!

I like to consider myself not much of a complainer (see other reviews) but my flight out of PHX to LAS VEGAS was horrendous.

Allow me to clarify. Not the flight itself but the plane. I might as well have been on a private jet. I think if I stretched my body from fingertips to toes I would make up the width of the plane... I'm 5'1.... Another down side was that they charge for checked baggage - needless to say I was not going to pay the extra fee and thus consolidated all my belongings into a small 'approved' suitcase, only to come to find out that it wouldn't fit in the overhead storage. Again - terrible. Again - reference to the size.So, I'm pretty sure I got ripped off here. From the prices listed on the website, kalbi tang ranges from 9-11 dollars. With tax, it shouldn't be anymore than 13 dollars. Having just moved to the PHX area from SoCal, I was hardcore craving some Korean food. A few weeks back, I scoured yelp to find this place. I ordered the Kalbi tang to-go and was charged 15 dollars. I was a bit surprised at the price seeing as cost of living was so low here but happily paid while giving a tip to the lady working the front because I didn't know any better. I went home, opened up my mediocre soup and continued to stew. 15 dollars was a lot for the soup I got. Something didn't seem right. I went online and low and behold, the price wasn't right. I think the lady charged me extra because she thought she could and pocketed the difference. Horrible!!! So not a fan of shady practices and this place seems to take the cake. I really wish she hadn't done that though. I would have been an excellent customer seeing as choices for Korean food are limited in this area.People who rate this place over 2 stars are either "on the books" or suffered from a frontal lobotomy. 

Here are 6.5 reasons not to go here:

1) El Zocalo had a 2.5hr wait last night, so we walked across the street to Serranos and was immediately seated

2) Ordered Don Julio Margaritas, received 4 small wine glasses with Sweet & Sour (waitress acknowledged they were made with too little alcohol)

3) Terrible Ambiance (drop tile-ceiling, commercial pressboard restaurant tables)

4) Waitress couldn't remember what anyone ordered numerous times (forgot sour cream, forgot corn tortillas)

5) Rather than coming by to fill up the water, they leave pitchers on the table

6) the food was doused in salt; heck, even this morning I had to move my watch band out a notch

6.5) There's an adult video store next door...closedWorst Costco I've ever been to. The lines here on a Monday at 3pm are double or triple what they are at the store on Bell road on a weekend. Super unorganized with everyone crashing their giant carts into other people trying to get a spot in line. The lines go back into the aisles, but some people curved sideway, can't tell which line is where. It's a disaster. I'd rather drive a half hour out of my way to go to arrowhead Costco to avoid this store.This place had over priced food that was very below average not to mention a Camara that is working and records in the men's room!! WTF drinks tasted very weak STAY AWAYWARNING: WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE!

My bf & I bought a Groupon for here & it was out first time dining at this spot. The workers were extremely rude & then we asked to speak to the manager. He would not accept the groupon because it said it was for four ppl but the other couple canceled last minute. The groupon for 2 people cost less money but we wanted to spend a lot more than the 2 person deal but the manger refused.

So let me get this straight.....you're telling me you don't want our business? Especially since we told you we'd like to spend a lot more than the 2 person deal? Why does it matter how many ppl are dining if we just told you we'd like to spend so much more money?  RIDICULOUS

On top of that he tried to swindle us into paying waaaay more if we wanted to stay & dine. He was the rudest manager I've ever met in my life. He had an attitude the entire time & was extremely unfriendly. He basically said its our fault that we can't follow the rules.

It's ironic that I'm writing such a negative review because we initially decided to eat here after reading the positive reviews on yelp....but this was by far an awful experience.

After we left we went to Craftsteak in MGM GRAND & spent 3 times as much because we knew we'd get better service & the best food guaranteed.I went here, the food was not good. The owner seemed very polite and friendly, and concerned over the economy. The placed appeared very clean and maintained inside.

My polish dog was overlooked on the outside, and raw in the middle. I forced myself to eat it, and regretted it later.

I did like the presentation, the while tray and napkins neatly displayed on the tray. The tootsie roll on the side was a nice touch.

The cook was really scary looking. Three days later,  I accidentally stumbled upon his picture on Megan's List, he apparently lives somewhere near the AFB. I wasn't searching for this guy, but I am always paranoid and look at the app on my iPhone to be aware of my surrounding.  I can't believe I accidentally stumbled upon it. I really wish I hadn't gone there.This place is HORRIBLE!!!!!!  I work about a hundred yards away and have eaten there twice now.  The first time the place was empy and it took 30 minutes to get our food.  The second time there were people there but still not full and it took an HOUR and FIFTEEN MINUTES for them to bring out burgers, fries, a pork sandwich,and wings!!!!  Nobody came back to apologize or see how we were doing, and then when we did talk to a manager she was a complete BITCH and offered us coupons for a free fountain drink.  This place is a joke unless you have 2 hours to kill for lunch and enjoy mediocre bar food and bitchy bar managers.  They will never see another one of my hard earned dollars and I hope they do not see of any of yours!!!!I used to love this place and would try and frequent it on the weekends--but this place hows gone WAY DOWN HILL!  I keep going back hoping that they get better but no such luck.

The service is terrible and they treat customers like you are bugging them when ordering.
They ALWAYS get my order wrong ( I get the tofu spread- cant eat cheese) and when I try and get my order fixed they make a fuss.

But worst of all- the people making your bagels do not wear gloves. They handle money at the register and go straight to making your food without washing their hands.
Terrible. 
I used to love this place and now I refuse to ever go back.Wow, people in Las Vegas must be on crack to give this place 3 stars. My 1 star is being generous. 

I stayed at the Freemont last year and on the first day just wanted to grab something quick to eat so I got some chinese food from here. This is the worst chinese food I have ever eaten. The egg rolls were disgusting. Actually, everything they served was disgusting. I ended up throwing the food away. 

Avoid this place at all cost. You better off starving to death then eating here.The worst check in process ever.  The place is old and tired.I would just hope that my room and blankets would be cleaned BEFORE I check into our room. So disappointed to take the purple blanket off the bed to find "leftovers" from the last couple stay!I can't believe so many people give this place anything above a 1 star.  We've been three times because it was so close to our house, what a bummer.  

The scary thing is their staff doesn't know much of anything about dogs.  We asked for a trainer recommendation and they looked at us like we were crazy then suggested that we look through the business cards that people drop off on the counter.   

The bakery is cool, but I would be worried with a staff that knows so little about dogs to feed my puppy food from this place.  I just don't want to mess around with something that might not be healthy. 

The part that is a real bummer, and why we will never be back, is that they don't take any returns for anything, ever.  We bought a toy for our dog, decided we didn't want it and tried to take it back the next day.  I had the receipt and it was in one of those plastic clam shell things...totally unopened.  They still said they wouldn't take it back.  The thing cost $27 plus tax too boot!  I did a little research and found two local pet stores within a mile that both carry the same products for less, and their staff is well trained.  

I would stay away if I were you...cute does not equal safe or fair.The last 2 times, I have taken my pooch to Cosmo, she has come home sick. The first time, she got a rash all over her neck (even after being washed down at home afterwards). This last time we went (about 2 weeks ago) she started throwing up in the lake. Then, I noticed a small dog (possibly a Jack Russell mix was doing the same thing) and then my friend's dog (a lab mix) was throwing up as well. Time to leave, right? I took my dog home and gave her a bath (but the same rash still returned on her neck). 

A few hours later, I get a call from my friend. She had to take her dog to the vet emergently because she wouldn't drink any water, could barely get up, and was breathing very heavily after being sick at the park. The vet said that it appears to be some sort of virus that she probably caught in the water. The dog was rehydrated and given some antibiotics and perked up within a few days, but still... that's scary. We will no longer be going to this dog park. It's worth the drive to Tempe's dog parks to keep my dog safe and healthy.There's Low Standards and No Standards! They WIN NO STANDARDS! 

Don't be deceived this establishments looks fun and exciting, however the services is TERRIBLE! If you enjoy being treated like the dirt at the bottom of your shoe, this is the place for you.  However, if you like to receive great customer service and a delightful meal for a reasonable price this is NOT the place for you.  I went to "BLONDIES" after a late night wedding in Vegas and it was to die for or from in the literal.  
1) It took forever to get service and food (people that were seated after us were eating before us) 2) One of the individuals in my groups order was not correct 3) The one thing I order a baked potato was cold and old 3) The manager could careless and he let us know it from the response he gave my friend.  

When it was all said and done, I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt! So, I took matters into my own hands and said to myself maybe a different approached and a different manager would bring so much need light to the situation.  Nope, I will say at least the other manager attempted to listen, until the rude and disrespectful manger decided to interject with his ignorance (adding fuel to the fire).  As a result, of being completely disrespected and devalued as a customer, I decide to attempt to contact the owner (no success, however not surprised), and finally I decided to write something to caution other travelers not to waste your money at a place like this, when there are other great and fabulous venues in Vegas worth the money.  I refuse to spend my hard earned money at place that could careless how customers are treated.  The staff is a reflection of the management and the management is a reflection of the ownership.  There end is the problem no accountability and employees are allowed to treat customers less than civilized.  They are one of the only establishments open late on Miracle Mile and thus they could careless, plus they aren't about building customer loyalty. 

Good Luck if you dare to Dine there!I went to the Pearl recently for a concert by the Cure and although I was considering attending the Depeche Mode show in August, I definitely will not return to this venue for another concert experience. It baffles me that a location which puts on rock shows on a regular basis has no procedure in place for dealing with fans. There is no way to line up in order to get a good spot for the general admission area (the floor) and even though we managed to get to be first in line when they did finally allow people inside the main doors, a combination of poor management by security (scanning our ticket but not issuing wristbands) and poor crowd control by their security meant that we were nearly trampled on the way down the stairs and had dozens of people shove their way in front of us. The descent to the general admissions area turned into a howling rampage down three flights of stairs and landings and then through one small doorway. I'm very shocked that no one was seriously injured getting down to the floor area and would highly recommend to the management of the Pearl that they invest in A) a course on crowd control for their security B) security who are trained in dealing with rabid fans and C) a set of barricades or ropes which with to control said crowds. Until you hear of any of these things taking place, the Pearl is definitely a venue to avoid at all costs.DO NOT GO HERE-esp. If your own posh hotel has 5 pools and better service.  Staff hung over from the precious shift at the club closing at 4am so running late to open waiting 15 minutes for kiddie pool "beach" to open. Staff hounding us about buying drinks and renting beach chairs that were 1) all reserved and 2) no one was there at 10:15am.  Coming from the Bellagio I expected better service as I felt practically kicked out of there because what, we were not hot enough?!!!!  Making my blood boil just writing this esp. After spending $10 on taxi and $32 on drinks and we stayed less than 10 minutes.  All the waitresses are hot so any photos you see advertised are of them to make you think only beautiful people go there. Consoled myself with a clutch from Alexander McQueen-you won't be getting my business anymore TAO (restaurant was good, club was good but crowded).  I hope the Venetian shuts you down b/c seriously they have better and bigger pools than you.I went to this restaurant after searching for a Thai food lunch spot during a weekend of school.  I went with three friends.

First off, a child about seven greeted us at the door and then went running into the back room yelling for what I suppose was "adult" in her native tongue.  Second, we were seated and the server came to take our drink order.  My co-student said "lemonade" and she said "okay".  My other co-student said "lemonade" and the server began to talk in her native tongue as she walked away.

The food was decent; however, not good enough to merit me ever going back.  We get to the end of our meal and ask for four checks.  The woman (who speaks English) looks at me like I have just caused her three days of extra work.  She says "no".  I say "we each have a card" and she said "no card for you." 

THEY DO NOT TAKE CREDIT CARDS AND THEY DO NOT HAVE THAT POSTED ANYWHERE ON THE WALL, THE MENU, OR INSIDE/OUTSIDE OF THE RESTAURANT.  And...we don't have cash (who does?).

Then, to top it off...she wants my credit card number to write on the check.  WHAT FOR?

I will never return and have begun boycotting at my school...local and has over 500 students.  Nice job, Washun.Food was ok. Nothing special. Wouldn't go there again mostly because the girl taking our order had a HUGE attitude and wasn't even listening when we were asking her questions. Pretty disappointing. Would have given a little higher rate if the service was better. Also paid $20 for two burritos and it totally wasnt worth the money.I don't think I've ever been more concerned for my safety than the hour I stayed here. Checked in, creeped out and waited for my taxi to come back and get me the hell out of there. That made up my hour. The taxi driver that dropped me off told me, "if you stay here, lock your door and do not come out."  I was fine until my door wouldn't stay locked and especially after I noticed the peep-hole was plastered closed.
And just for clarification, it's the BEST WEST INN MOTEL. had I known it was a motel, I would have never selected it.Been a patron for years. Eat- In and Carry-Out, never a tab below $50. Disappointed again last night for the last time. Food was inedible, we joked that we should feed it to our dog, but we really love our dog, threw it away. Shrimp Emperial, $18.95, Shrimp was clearly frozen too long and tainted the whole watery, bland dish with bad fish smell. Baked Ziti, $10.95, watery, bland, have had better from a can. Biggest disappointment... Antipasto Misto, $10.95 for Oscar Meyer and Rubbery Caprese. Really sad because it used to be a great neighborhood restaurant, now its perfect if you're from out of town, don't like good Italian, and will never be back.Went to have a late lunch at this location. Ordered a Cheese Coney combo with a 44 oz diet coke. The staff was friendly, but the hot dog was over cooked. I didn't realize it was over cooked until I got home and took my first bite. Ended up going back to the restaurant to raise the issue. They offered to replace the Coney or refund my money for just the Coney since I didn't bring my soda and tots back. I will not be back at this location. Hot Dogs should not be served if they have been sitting on the burner long enough to burn.Um, the works pizza we ordered was smashed to one side, so we called back to get a replacement. The girl replied, "Well, we could send you a fresh one, but it wont be like 5 minutes, it would be more like a half hour. Or we could credit you for a large, one topping pizza." Um, not a works like we ordered? So we dug into the extra cheese only to find it under cooked. Ewe. When calling for a full refund because we didn't want to eat this crap, the guy who answered this time was very compliant, but never even said he was sorry for the hassle, or the crappy pizza. Bummer, I liked Hungry Howie's Pizza, but we wont order from this place again.I've always had issues with this cable company. They always raise their prices, even though I've seen ads on tv saying how they don't raise their prices, but the other companies do. 
Oooh Cox, you little liars.

The past month I have had issues with channels not working and when you call Cox, they tell you it's no them and it's that particular network, so the issue is say with the TLC network and not Cox. Um ok!  Damn it! I'm trying to watch a "What Not To Wear" marathon and TLC is not coming in! Fix it you effers!

Their service is just down right expensive and there are all these little fees that seem ridiculous to pay for. 

For months we have been trying to get the phone number on file changed as they have an old phone #, but they never make the change. 

I'm pretty fed up with their service, but really the area of town I live in I don't have much of a choice but to use their service for cable and internet.PAY ATTENTION TO ALL THE BAD REVIEWS!! They are right. I am currently on hold with COX  - 5 minutes later listening to really bad music on a loop so I decided to share my experience here. I had COX years ago and never had a problem so I decided to go with them when I moved back to the valley. I had several months of "hidden" charges on my bill and was sick of it so I decided to switch. I got a call from Patty in "Outbound Retention" who asked how I would stay. (the fact that that department exists should be a red flag right there) I told her and she got me a lower rate, better service and whole home DVR service...so I stayed. 3 months later. I have had billing problems EVERY month and I am currently on hold trying to keep them from turning my service off because they say I am past due when I am not. Unbelievable. I would switch tomorrow but was told they have to rewire some things in the attic and my walk in closet is the entrance...a lot of hassle. So here I am...on hold. He is getting the job done but I have already spent so much of my own time trying to fix their mistakes. If you are stuck with COX don't hesitate to tell them how unhappy you are, ask for a supervisor, threaten to switch....those things all have seemed to work. (but do it nicely, it seems to have more clout) I am basically going to threaten them if I have ONE more problem with billing I will switch. They really don't want you to go so this seems to be the only way to get your way at this company.Worst customer service I have ever received in my life.

I bought a nonrefundable online coupon for 3 of their LipoLaser treatments. The front desk lady, Debbie, was beyond nasty to me every time we spoke. I decided I'd rather lose out on the money than ever step foot in that place again. 

When I called to set up the consultation, it was about 6 weeks before the expiration date. I tried asking Debbie if I would have enough time to get all the treatments in if I waited a week because of my work schedule. ( I knew nothing about the LipoLaser stuff, like how long to wait between appts.)  She retorted snottily with how she doesn't know my schedule and that can't tell me when to make my appointment. So rude!!

Regardless, I made an appointment for the consultation for the following week. Upon arriving there was no one at the front desk or in the waiting room.  I stood at the front desk for about 3 mins before Dr. Gallagher greeted me and told me to have a seat and "Debbie knew I was coming and should be right back."  I waited for over 10 minutes wondering why I wasn't filling out paperwork or something proactive. Debbie never showed.  The Doc came back out and gave me some forms to fill out.  I did that. Then waited another 8 mins or so. It finally became apparent that Debbie was not coming back so the Doc gave me a brief tour. He was friendly enough, the consultation seemed pointless and definitely unorganized.  The "tour" took about 5 mins.  I made an appt. for my first session the following week. 

I gave myself 30 mins to get there for what would be normally a 15 drive.  However, it happened to be the crazy fluke day that it started snowing in Scottsdale. Traffic was significantly worse than normal.  Five mins before my appt. time I called Touch of Health, trying to be considerate and explain that because of the random insane weather I may be a few mins late.  Debbie answered. I explained that I've been sitting on the 101 for 20 mins and could be a few mins a late.  She snapped at me and said "Well, I'm sitting here waiting on you!"  I was flabbergasted and appalled. I wasn't even late yet, and I was being scolded by a receptionist?! I couldn't even handle the rudeness anymore. So I responded with "Well, funny. I was waiting on you for my consultation..." She cut me off and got super defensive with how "No, no. You're weren't waiting on me. The Doctor helped you!"  I realized it was pointless to argue with this awful receptionist, yet I was enraged at this moment. I told her I certainly wasn't planning on traffic being awful and the situation. "We'll if you're more than 15 mins late you'll have to reschedule.'' I decided to just forget it at this point, and told her I wanted to reschedule. I had no desire to be yelled at further by this lady with a severe attitude problem.  Instead of rescheduling me then, she told me to call back tomorrow. 

I did not call back.  What a terrible experience from beginning to end.  The coupon I  bought was not cheap but I refuse to have any interaction with Debbie again.  She made me feel unappreciated and just plan awful with her nasty tone and nasty words. I don't know if I received such awful treatment because I was using the coupon, but I should've been treated with the same respect as everybody else.  I don't know how the place would still be open if Debbie treats all patients/customers in such a rude despicable manner. 

I wish I could leave no stars!Short version: This place is a shithole. Don't bother.
Long version: From the moment we walked into the rental office to the day we moved out, this place was a stain.  My husband and I chose Talus as temporary living quarters based on proximity while awaiting the completion of our new home.  In retrospect, it was an impetuous and ill-informed decision.  I suppose our short-term status blinded us, but if you're on the lookout for long-term housing be warned.
We had issues with:
*  Parking spaces -  We were told it would be two weeks before one was available.  Fine, except in reality there wasn't one available for the better part of TWO MONTHS. 
*  Structure - It was so fucking loud in that place that we never once slept through the night while we lived here.  Never.  I know apartments have a reputation for paper-thin walls, but trust me, this isn't the first "multi-family" housing situation I've lived in, and the light fixtures literally swayed from the tenants above simply walking around.  I'm not exaggerating.  I won't even get in to the frequent toddler wrestling matches that took place above us.  
*  Staff - outside of the initial contract negotiations, nobody here gives a tin shit about the tenants.  Our infrequent complaints were always met with a scowl and were typically pawned off onto another party, if addressed at all. No complaint or conflict was ever sufficiently handled.  
*  Grounds - every conceivable surface was covered in dog shit. Constantly.  The pool was consistently green and littered with cigarette butts and spent beer cans.
*  Bugs -  Out of control. I've lived in Phoenix for nearly 20 years and have never experienced this many scorpions, ants or crickets.  I'll echo Chrysty C.'s previous complaint that charging for "monthly" pest control ought to negate any pest sightings.  It didn't.  We found several scorpions and countless crickets. We also spent many a night vacuuming ants from our bathroom and bedroom floors.  While the pests mainly infested the interior, the worst area was the water heater closet on the patio - the crickets were so numerous that we began referring to the closet as the "Temple of Doom".  Foul.  
It's difficult to pinpoint which aspect was the worst.  Pure suffering for three months.
I feel it's important to point out that it's been two years since we lived here (June - September, 2008).  Maybe the situation has improved since we left.  Somehow I doubt it.   Regardless, I'm still upset about our time here, and I thought my fellow Yelpers should know.   Caveat emptor!Waited 30 minutes for a burrito. With no lines and four people working. They forgot my order. Avoid this place at all cost if you want quality serviceThis place makes me realise that there is tremendous business potential for another Indian grocery store in the Chandler area. The owners hit the jackpot with the location and that is why they take every liberty to dole out substandard groceries. 

The expiry date is never mentioned on the packaging and if it is, it is usually wrong. The other day we bought some chapatis (Indian bread) with 22nd June '09 expiry clearly marked on it. When we opened the packet for dinner we found nothing but green fungus. On another occasion we bought some solidified pickle. There have been innumerable disappointments but we kept going back because there was no other option nearby. 

The first lesson that we learn in a Marketing class is that 'the customer always wins' and for now I have decided to shift my purchases to another store in Tempe.Had to eat here with coworkers for lunch today and was incredibly disappointed. My $8 caesar salad was probably the tiniest I've ever had. Service was slow, the entire table was nearly finished before mine arrived, and staff was unapologetic. I've had side salads larger than the full salad they served me for lunch. Overall a miserable experience and I won't be back.I wish I had check Yelp first instead of Google Hotel Finder.

Using the online booking tool, I got a room with two beds for $84 (tax and breakfast included).  I guess that was about a fair price.  

The Bad: The building is old and ugly, and just off the freeway.  The pool was closed.  The room had not been cleaned completely - a used bar of soap by the sink, stray hair in the shower, etc.  The beds were lumpy.

The Good: Bed linens were new and high quality.  The noisy AC masked the freeway noise.  The breakfast options, though unattractively presented, was varied and satisfying.I tried the shrimp burrito per the review on here. One of the worst I've had...ever. (Salsitas' has a good one, IMO.) It just didn't taste that good...it was spicy, which I like, but the flavor was boring. Hubby and kid had bean burritos and weren't impressed either.

Everything was WAY over salted. And, I know this is TMI, but we all spent hours in the bathroom the next day. :( We will not go back.How can a yogurt shop not have any vanilla or chocolate??? Not any version of either??? Very poor. Cleaning out the machines is not an excuse on a very crowded Sunday night.So disappointed. I'm new to the area and very excited to see a salon close to my house. On my first visit I was passed from one technician to another and then overcharged but the work was good, the technicians were at least friendly.   I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I went back yesterday and the young lady at the front apparently was upset that I didn't want a pedicure "just a fill" so she informed me what I would be having done instead of asking me, was so rushed that I felt like my fingers were on fire from the drill. I finally had to stop her because she was being so rough. When it became apparent that she had no intention of doing a proper job I left.  Definitely will not go back, nor would I recommend.This place always has very long lines, even at the self checkout stations. On top of that several of the checkout stations are always closed. I can understand being too cheap to keep the checkout lines adequately staffed, but closing self checkout lines while customers are spending several minutes in line just seems malicious.Disappointing... I went in to kill some time and check out the shop, and will not be going back. The layout looks like an indoor yard sale, there is an "old stuff" aroma, and the sales staff looked like they hated being there. Not a great experience at all...The waiter spilled curry sauce all over me and didn't even offer an apology. 
Not only did I pay for a crappy meal but I also had to pay for my dry cleaning. 
Don't go the service sucks and so does the food.Food is ok. Service sucks. Took forever to get service and the check. Looking for a new place for Thai food.When fiance and i walked in...we looked at each other in shock at how tiny this place was. "No big," i said.... "this could be one of those amazing spots...i mean people look like they are enjoying their meals." i was way off. Very disappointing. Table was dirty. Server let us sit for almost 10 minutes before giving us a menu. Then took my order and walked away without my fiance's order. Weird. I ordered soup and it wasn't good. It was bad. Lunch meals were decent. Bathroom is gross which indicates to me their kitchen may not be any different. I wish I had visited the bathroom BEFORE I ordered (while waiting for FOREVER) because after seeing the water beetle and who-knows-what-insect in the god-forsaken disgusting hole-of-a-bathroom...I would have left FAST. IM SERIOUS!! Look at my other reviews of other restaurants...you will see that I am always honest.The food here is awful. Go elsewhere.Do not trust this jeweler! The have the absolute worst customer service and over charge for their jewlery. The also do terrible work on custom Peices. I filled a BBB complaint and he still has yet to respond. He never responded to the BBB complaint it is now closed and reflects a negative mark on his buisness

He did such a poor job on my custom necklace that I had to have another jeweler repair the pendent. I did not trust him to fix it. He did however agree to pay for the repair work on necklace. Finally after 4months of dealing w/ this mess I have a completed necklace the way it is suppose to look.
I would not reccomend this jeweler to anyone!Never again.

Late night, post-show, 10pm or so. Fond memories (of long ago) and a yen for some fresh, lighter fare led us to Hamada for a mix of sushi, teppan grilling, and old standards (a strong desire for fried rice was shared by my companion).

Walk in. Reverie broken. 

The teppan grills were turned off. We asked for a quiet spot for two and were instead tucked in next to a large group and another small group of 3 or 4. No sushi and no fried rice.

What the...?

Short and bitter:

The broiled mackerel I ordered wasn't broiled as much as it was destroyed by some sort of hot, firey mass of anti-food matter. It was flavorless, dry, and not even suitable for hockey season.

The grilled teriyaki steak he ordered was OK, doused in sauce, but ultimately cooked OK, if slightly overdone. The sauce was meant to hide the fact that it was not, in fact, grilled. It looked steamed, if that, and had a bit of an odd texture.

No fried rice because the grills were turned off... so they can't cook some up in the kitchen with the rest of the hot food? No sushi, either. Because why... the grills were off? 

Question: If you can't serve the menu, and you don't offer a special, late night menu, and if you can't cook properly that which you do offer... why stay open?

The sake was low-grade, bitter. We drank it to mask the taste (or lack thereof) of the food. The service was nonexistent, the food horrendous, and the atmosphere was dingy, left-behind, and a bit sad.

My fish was supposed to be an appetizer. His steak was an entree. We shared the sake. For $50?! Seriously?

Much like the rest of my Flamingo experience ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/flamingo-las-vegas-las-vegas-2#hrid:Y3gKnYNn1lYCCR8FpSoT_w ), if I could give 0 stars, I would.If you are thinking of using this company, my personal experience with them is not good. I called and made an appointment for them to come out and give me a free estimate to replace my patio doors. They never showed up for the appointment nor did they call to cancel or reschedule. They just blew us off after we had wasted two hours of our day waiting for them to come at the appointed time. Any company that treats potential customers this way do not deserve new business.Is there a negative 5 star option?! At first, we thought this move would be amazing based upon how smoothly the estimate process went. We got a great, competitive quote, and were excited to work with these guys. Unfortunately, it was all extremely downhill from there. First they dispatched a driver who only had enough room for slightlt less than 1/3 of our stuff. Then, they sent a team with a uhaul type truck to load the rest of our house, but they showed up just before the cleaners arrived. (That's 3 hours after they were supposed to be done!) The next day I was informed that the 2nd load items would be packed in a shopment container, and would arrive around the same time as the 1st load. Not ideal, but better than nothing, right? Wrong!! Our 1st load was delivered today, 7/13/14. Our 2nd load? Well, its back in Phoenix.  When will it be delivered? Hopefully by 8/15/14...seriously?! They tried to make it better by accepting partial payment for the 1st load, and offered $100 per day for our stuff until it actually arrives. I guess we'll take it since that's the "best they can do" but we'd rather have our stuff, especially since ALL of our 1 yr olds stuff (clothes, crib, diapers, etc) are part of the 2nd load!! Long story short, the actual movers were PHENOMENAL, but Dircks/Mayflower are AWFUL! !!!!While the staff was very nice, the food was terrible.  Too much flavorless sauce, too much cheese (which is quite a feat), and the dough tasted worse than my elementary school's cardboard pizza boxes...Wow.. The service here is deplorable, I don't know if I've ever been so disrespected  before at any bar. One of the bartenders spilled a bottle of jäger and doused me with some booze without so much as an apology. Not to mention it took maybe 12-15 minutes just to get a beer after sitting down at the bar.. The only thing that brings me back here is that I have no choice with the lack of arcades for the kids.. Once again, poor service from a poor location.Rude hostess, actually said "that's not my fault" for the 30 minutes we wasted there trying to find a waiter. Yes, it certainly WAS your fault. You seated us in a filthy area of your abandoned restaurant and everyone I saw was either long since done or still waiting to see a server. Bad job of the management, servers, and waitstaff. Congrats Dave & Busted!  If only negative stars were an option...I went there on 03/14/2014 and had dinner with my family. We also played but later that night around 11PM my son began throwing up bad!! he was sick non stop all night and slept on the bathroom floor with me ( I stayed with him). The following day at 1:00 I took him to Urgent Care to find out he had food poisoning and a bad case of it too! He was sick for a week. Then I went home and called I spoke to a manager by the Name of Nate and I asked for my money back. He said he would just send us some stuff that would make up for it, I said ok but guess what it is not April 3,2014 and nothing I live close so it should have come no problem. I am not going to contact the corporate offices and then a lawyer. My child got sick from chicken strips, I am not being unreasonable but I had medial bills and time off work. I feel that refunding my food cost is reasonable. I am highly disappointed, not only cause he got sick but because the ethics carried in the situation was none at all by the staff at this company.This place over charge, and they will recommend unnecessary procedures to run up the charges. As a person who have worked in a dental industry for last ten years, I know the average cost and what other doctors are charging. These guys were trying to charge me close to $1,400 for a dental crown (after my dental insurance coverage). This is ridiculous amount of money they are charging. It only cost them $50-$90 fabricate the dental crown from a lab. This is almost an implant crown price. By the way, most doctors that I have known only charges $600-$800 for a dental crown (which is reasonable due to labor and overhead costs). They charge me more than $200 for simple cleaning and a couple of x-rays. I had this similar procedures done in California for $75. By the way, I had a filling done less than 2 years, and this inexperience doctor recommended me to get a dental crown, which is a major red flag. For your information, run away from the doctors who recommend, veneers, dental crowns, implants, and bleaching right away. Veneers and dental crowns are major dental procedures and will affect you permanently. For bleaching, you should not do it unless you really have bad staining. Bleaching will turn your teeth partially grey, and you will have difficulty matching your shade if you ever have to do veneers or crowns. Dentists should always recommend least invasive procedure to maintain the natural teeth.Does an honest reputable solar company exist in the valley?  So far I have yet to find one and would love to hear about one that can actually service and repair solar systems.  Because this one certainly is not that company.  They are so so so poor at customer service that I lack the heart and energy to go into each and every time that they have failed to follow up, failed to return phone calls, failed to fix the problem, fail to fix the problem they just fixed and then give one lame excuse and reason they can muster to avoid dealing with frustrated customers.  The fact they make extra money on 'trip charges' only motivates them more to come repeatedly.  The last 'reason' i got today was "oh that's because they need to fix it in the morning because of expansion and contraction". Then why did they come last time in the afternoon when they know this? I've been dealing with the company since late March and if I knew of a single option I'd run from them screaming but unfortunately they have a cornerstone on this market. I'm not sure if the woman I speak to every time (Cathy) has any skin in the game, at least enough to care about the company's future, but in my experience she holds the key to it's success or failure since she is the intermediary of every transaction and only serves to further the customer's aggravation and frustration. If I ever need service again I'll trash my system before I call these people back. 

In a single word:  unconscionable.This is first time I try to use their  service.  Base on the review, I think they should be good.  We call for service for my water heater.  They are way overcharged.  I frankly told them that I have to compare the service.  They charged me 60.00 knowing they will not get the job.  Pretty sneaky company.   60 dollars just to tell me how much it cost me to get the installation done.  Pretty easy money, huh?!  I bet they don't make business by doing good job but piling up the profit by going out to make 60.00 for half hour.  Take my advise,  avoid them.  I found a good plumber after all and I believe you will.the folks in student financial aid  are the reason I don't attend this school they are clueless, dishonest and dare I say hateful.   If you have tons of money and need no advice then go here.   If you ever .......... ever need help with paying for school then lol do as I was told "scale back your lifestyle"   even the advisors know how horrible they are, yet no one does a thing......

before leaving I went on Facebook to get info from other students about fin aid... guess what they deleted it.   LOL ummmmm okI heard a lot of positive things about this place, so I decided to see what all the hype was about. I was very disappointed with everything. The wing sauce was mostly oil and didn't taste good at all. Save your money and don't eat here.I wrote a review here about a year ago and it's gone.  This place has the worst customer service full of lies, they will say anything or do anything to get a sale. Do yourself a favor there's much better places to go to then here.  And they do not donate your old furniture like they tell you they take it to the nearest dumpster and throw it out.  You can click on my name hopefully and see my full review my experience that day.went there for lunch and had great service and good chelsea salad and so so minestrone soup.  garlic knots baked to perfection with tons of flavor and a nice crisp on the bottom.  so, i bragged it up to my family and took eight of us there for dinner on friday night!  mistake number 1 !  15 minutes for drink order,  ordered the same thing i had for lunch the day before and while the salad was good the soup was warm and garlic bread was a dough ball with no garlic slurry or crisp bottom.  complained to manager and she was full of excuses of the oven not being reliable!  slice of pizza was doughy!  antipasto salad had no toppings on it!  really?  11 people supposedly working with 8 customers and could never get their attention!  what an embarrassment!  new york would evict this pretender!

someone call the  real nypd and arrest them!just got long hauled by driver- George Genaro - Cab #3644. What was supposed to be quick trip from LV Convention Center to my hotel- he took the long route claiming there was a strike in the north entrance of the hotel and gave me attitude when i told him to take the staight route. when i arrived at the hotel i went to the north entrance and - surprise- NO strike. would avoid this cab company in futureForever boycotting this location. Franchise-owned, doesn't accept the CBTL app rewards, doesn't brew flavored coffee after 11am, and doesn't carry quiche anymore. After several bad experiences at this location, I'll never return.The one star is for it's convenient location.

The -4 stars are for the general incompetence of the staff, both store and pharmacy.  My latest experience with a female associate at the register was less than optimal as she couldn't figure out that if an item cost $2.24, and I have a coupon for $3 off, said item should be free (minus tax). She eventually took $2 off (thus overcharging me) but I'm not going to argue with stupid over $.24.

The pharmacy also proves to be less than stellar: I've been given incorrect dosage, incorrect pill amounts (this resulted in a complaint and later investigation with the Nevada board of pharmacy), and incorrect information. I tried to fill a prescription that I later found out was not made in that medium anymore and instead of knowing this, they told me it was "out of stock". I've also had a tech give me such attitude when I asked her to locate a drug at another location that I went to a competitor across the street instead.

It would behoove CVS corporate to take this store over and clean house. That said, patients beware.Unbelievable. You try so hard to find an HONEST mechanic but in this town they don't seem to exist. My husband took our car in to these people to get a new battery and they told him he needed a new alternator and that it cost roughly $400 when he and I both knew all we needed was a battery. Sure enough, we took it to another mechanic, told him how these people tried to screw us, and they happily gave us a new battery, now the car is fine. The managers of this store should be ashamed of themselves for trying to take advantage of their customers.This place is HORRIBLE! Especially the customer service! The lady who works there actually had the nerve to lecture me about ordering! What the heck is that I wasted 30 out of the 40 minutes of my break going to this place to pick up my lunch, then having to come back cause they left out a part of my order!
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NO ONE GO TO THIS PLACE TILL THE GET BETTER SERVERS, AND CASHIERS!!!! 
NO ONE LIKES PEOPLE WHO ARE RUDE TO CUSTOMERS!!!! I'm choosing to spend money here, you better respect me enough not to be rude, and give me attitude!I am writing this review to be informative and also see if others have experienced the same type of treatment as I did when I took my pooch in for an anal gland expression.     I took my dog in for a routine expression with Dr. Johnson and we were in and out of there in under 30 minutes.  The assistant indicated his glands were full and to come more regularly.  At this point I was pleased and planned to give them a thumbs up... after all the location is great and the service was quick!  However the next day our pup, Fray seemed visibly uncomfortable...two days later there seemed to be bleeding....I took him back to Dr. Johnston at Banfield to see if this was usual or was there a need for concern and had general questions about the overall health of Fray...after a deep breath he looked down and began a long narrative about their Wellness Plan and how this could save me money in the long run and what services were included....after about 10 minutes he said "Now to answer your questions..."  at which point he said he would need to take a closer look and  took Fray into the back to examine him....there was no examination done in front of me.  In a few minutes he returned to explain that his anal glands had ruptured and the process involved to clean and treat the trauma.  When I questioned how they could rupture after they were expressed by him two days ago he did not have any explanation but did note they were not ruptured at the time of his previous appointment.   He gave me a quote for the process required, mentioned the Wellness Plan again and said he would input some notes and I would be able to schedule the surgery at the front desk.  When I left the exam room to check out there were no notes and no treatment plan, not even antibiotics...The clerk said no notes had been entered yet, but to wait a few minutes...I shopped for a collar and returned to the front desk...still no notes.  She indicated the  doctor wanted to see Fray back in two weeks.  At this point I was a little confused given what the Vet has explained earlier.. I asked her wasnt this a bit urgent and she advised me to call back he next morning to see if any additional notes would be entered...I called and guess what, no notes.    I immediately took Fray to another Vet where he was treated right away and is healing nicely!  From the research I have done since this happened and the comments of the other veterinary service the fact the glands ruptured after the expression should not have happened.  I am also a bit suspicious how a hole appeared outside my dogs anus after he as examined by Dr. Johnson during our second visit, I had given Fray a bath immediately before this appointment and did not notice anything at all. Also the other Vet service mention the hole outside his anus and the gland did not seem to connect.....This is very questionable in my opinion!!   The Banfield Vet, Mr. Johnson seemed too  focused on selling pet insurance instead of the reason of my visit.  He seemed preoccupied and zoned out...a bit creepy.  I have read rave reviews about another Vet at this office, but I don't plan on returning to find out.

I heard from Banfield about 2 weeks later asking if I wanted to schedule Fray for a teeth cleaning...I don't think so!!My headlight has condensation in it. A lot of condensation. And when the dealership wants to charge you $300 for a new headlight assembly, and you can't find one in a pick-a-part for the life of you, there's only one thing a girl can do: stop caring and just change the bulb when it eventually goes out once a year.

Enter my need for Autozone. I've always gone to them to fix it... three times before to be exact. And every time, they give me a shpiel about how I need to replace the whole thing or it's gonna keep happening. And then they replace my bulb for me. For free. And they're nice about it. It's never seemed hard. 

Tonight was my first time at this location, and they seemed... rush-y. I told my cashier (older, grey hair with glasses... I think he was a manager because he was in a grey button-up instead of red like the rest of them) what I needed, paid, and that seemed like the end of the transaction. I stood there for a second and said "...do you guys fix it for me, or...." He sighed and said "I can take a look." Ok Mr. Attitude...

I should have known it was going to be bad right then, but he came out to my car, had me pop the hood, looked at it for literally one second and said "I can't get in there. You have to take it to a mechanic." A little perturbed, I said "Ok... is there a shop close by you could recommend?" He looked me dead in the eye and simply said "A mechanic."

No shit Sherlock?! A mechanic. And that was it. He went back in the store and I drove away with my headlight still out.

I called Firestone up the street the next day, and they wanted to charge me $80 to fix it. Lol no. So I asked my boyfriend, who is not a mechanic, to do it today on his day off... he fixed it in 10 minutes and said "That was really easy. That guy at Autozone was being a lazy asshole."

I understand that this might seem like no big deal, or like I might be overreacting, but I would have been a lot more understanding if he would have just said "We're kind of busy right now, but come back tomorrow and we can fix it" or something similar... or just hadn't been rude? If I'm going to a chain for a specific reason, I expect the same results every time. That's why I went to Autozone in the first place... because I KNOW they can fix it. There's no need to treat me like an annoying, stupid girl who doesn't know dick about cars... even if I really don't.

Long story short, I won't be back to this location. And I'll probably even reconsider Autozone as my primary choice for car care from now on.First off, I need to express that this place had some of the best service ever and this 1 star is for the food alone (as well as the prices [even if it was gifted, if I had to pay I would cry] - yikes). I believe that a restaurant has to have good food and good service for me to be a repeat customer and this place is a big DO NOT WANT for me as far as the food goes. 

Went here last night with a big party for my boyfriend's cousin's graduation. I noticed quickly that only the sides were vegetarian (obviously, this is a steak house) but after talking to the waiter he said that they could make a vegetable plate for me. I had high hopes since the last time this happened at Todd's who also lacked vegetarian entrees, and the food was spectacular. I also thought that since this place was as pricey as it was, anything I put in my mouth would be orgasmic. Unfortunately every single thing was bland as all get-out. 

First off, I tried the bread which looked great but they do not provide proper bread knives so the big fluffy bread ended up being smushed. It was also ridiculously flaky making a big mess and just didn't taste that great. 

My vegetable plate came and that's exactly what it was. It was literally giant vegetables just steamed - no herbs, no flavor, no spices - nothing. Totally disappointing. There was broccoli, a halved tomato, asparagus, cooked spinach, and portobello mushrooms which was the best part as those kind of mushrooms pack a lot of flavor by themselves. It was a huge plate but there was no punch. 

I tried some of the sides, the panko-encrusted onion rings and the mashed potatoes. Both were also almost flavorless but still kind of decent, but no way were they worth $10 each. Absolutely ridiculous pricing for something so very plain. 

The boyfriend and I shared a chocolate souffle for dessert which looked great but was kind of disgusting. It was a hot chocolate sludgy mess. The best part was the cream on the side. Not something I would order again. 

I was very disappointed with this restaurant. The absolutely impeccable service however could not make up for the awful food. The meat eaters at the table seemed happy with what they received but I was just in awe at how bland everything was. 

Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Pricing: 1/5 (just... yikes.. when my boyfriend said it was $43 for his itty bitty filet mignon I almost choked)
Food: 0/5 

I really, really wanted to give this place a chance but if you're a vegetarian who has taste buds, stay far, far away.I went with a friend who was having some piercing work done.  The piercer was nice but the rude old women at the front desk was horrible.  We asked for her help but she just started complaining about how much work and cleaning she had to do.  Why would anyone hire someone so abrasive to work with customers?  I have lots of choices about where I go . . . never going back there to be treated rudely.  Plus their jewelry selection is pretty sad.I've been going to spas for the last 12 years of my life, and I have to say the only high end thing about the Canyon Ranch Spa is the price. The place loked small though it's advertised as big. It looked old and a little dingy but that's not a big deal. The service was so-so. I bought the creations package for six people ($1200) and my sister got sick in their facility. They STILL charged me for her services along with the all day pass that was not used. My other sister cancelled her appointment to be able to take care of the sick one and of course, what a waste of money. The mananger tried to justify by saying it's because they have a 24 hr cancelation fee. Wow, even when a client gets sick at your spa? Tha's down right ridiculous. This place is just a lawsuit away from being taken down. Don't waste your money. I've never heard of this yelp website until recently and felt I had to warn the public. Don't go here, it sucks.Appearance can be very, very deceiving. From a little Mediterranean joint, this place came a long way. Very fancy decor and I believe they have live music instruments as well. I went there after seeing it a while back expecting the same corner food joint, instead we found a chic restaurant that looks like something you'd see on food network with the lack of a proper host and cloth napkin.

The food sucks and let me point out why. With appetizer (Domas), we were given the store bought and cold PITA bread (Notice the caps) with nothing to dip it with and with no butter. Rice with the order of # 7 were the type of rice they serve with Enchiladas. Chicken Kabobs were dry and the beef kabobs were unevenly cook. Some were well done while other were mid-well. Did I mention the paper menu which resembles the pizza menu you get on your door locks. Salad was just ok.

Service was somewhat impressive. Our server was very polite and gave a very professional impression. Halfway between ordering and getting our food, the music stops causing an uncomfortable amount of silence. 5 mins later, it resumed again. I couldn't actually tell where the music was from, didn't sound like Arabic or Persian. Could be Pashto.

In short, if you go for the food, don't expect anything close to Fresh Kabob on Sunset/Eastern where they serves fresh bread and Basmati rice. Pay $14 for plate with 6 pieces of Kabob look-alike Meat, rice you'd find in a Mexican taco shop with store bought pita bread but decor like a fancy restaurant at the strip. This is a classic example of when neighborhood food joints try to become a fancy restaurant and forget what got them a 3 thousand square-feet restaurant, THE FOOD.So its been an hour and 30mins and just got a phone call trying to verify my address, im guessing the drivers lost. Not sure how you have delivery drivers who cant deliver to your address. Last time I order from here. Really Disappointed

UPDATE: FOOD CAME AT 1hour 40mins and food was cold. Thanks for making me burn $25.We would have given this a zero if it was possible! This bald head driver was as rude as a person can be, unfortunately we did not get his name! He picked us up from Worldmart on Los Vegas Blvd to take us to the airport. Two ladies with back problems and it was raining. He never bothered to get out and help us with our bags or the doors! Drove fast and like a maniac. When we got to the airport he threw our tip back in our face and said you don't know a good ride when you get one? Tried to talk and be friendly to him when we got in the cab, but he only grunted. What ever you do DO NOT use Lucky Cab while in Los Vegas .. beyond rude! I will never get in a can in the future without getting a card with their name on it!HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE customer service! !!! They DON'T care about their patients. .. just your money! !I decided to go here to eat cuz its right next to gamestop and we were hungry. Plus I am a cheesesteak fanatic. So I was thinking you cant go wrong with cheesesteak. But after eating here, I stand corrected. I couldnt be any more wrong! I ordered the special which had everything and it was 9 bucks. My wife ordered the catfish. My oldest son got the cheeseburger. My youngest got a plain philly. 

Ok, so...........1 star because the cheesesteak I got was a soooooo greasy and I could barely taste the mushrooms, onions, and green peppers probably cuz there was hardly any. By far this has gotta be the blandest cheesesteak I have ever had. While I was chewing I couldnt help but think of at least 3 Philly cheesesteak places that are way better than this place. (Jersey Mikes, Philly's Best, and Capriotti's) For 9 bucks I almost had the urge to go up to the counter and tell them I didnt like it and for them to refund my money. That was just the sandwich.

Now the catfish......OMG that was even WORSE than the cheesesteak! First of all, the portions were tiny. There were 3 skinny filets on my wifes plate. The steak fries looked more appealing maybe because they were bigger and took up most of her plate. As soon as my wife took a bite, she had to eat some fries and cole slaw to get rid of the "bottom feeder" taste from her mouth. As soon as she mentioned it, I took a bite and it tasted like dirty sand. We both tried to mask the "sandy" flavor with lots of hot sauce and malt vinegar. I have never tasted catfish that bad before. 

The cheeseburger and plain philly was decent. If I had the option of no stars, then I would put that. So, if you are reading this and are thinking of eating here, DON'T!!!!!! I'm STILL trying to get rid of the "bad fishy taste" from my mouth! I definitely have to eat somewhere really good later on to make up for this bad experience.When we first arrived at Crestwood Suite everything looked good.  The person checking us in was very nice, but then everything went down hill.       
     The room we stayed in was very dirty.  On top of the refrigerator, and around microwave and stove was dirty.  There was dirty and dust in all corner.  
     The front desk also screwed up the days we were supposed to have our room cleaned.  We were scheduled to have towels changed and trash taken out on Tuesday, that ever happened, and the full cleaning that was scheduled on Thursday didn't happen.  After complaining to the desk, they told me the girl who checked us in was new, and had never scheduled us for any cleaning.  We did have our room finally cleaned, but about 18 hours before we checked out, at that point why bother. 
     If I had not booked on expedia, and would have last the money I paid for the room, I would have left and found another roomGirl working the counter was NOT pleasant at all, down right rude.  We were trying to not let that ruin our Robertos fix, sadly the food was not up to normal standards.  Side bar with all the peppers, carrots etc was lacking normal ingredients, baggies and napkins were also out.  
Carne Asada fries were good, bean burrito was ok, chicken tacos were horrible, meat dry and shells were so oddly chewie and hard at the same time.    Gonna have to rethink our Robertos meals hopefully this was just a one time bad day.What's it take to see a doctor here? I've been rescheduled on 4 times now!Came in at noon so I knew they would be busy. Like other reviews it seems like they only have one waiter. I came for take out so I placed my order and they said 10 minutes for soup, chicken lo mein, and general tso's chicken. Yea this is all for me to last throughout the day. To me Chinese take out is sick comfort food and I feel like death so its time to try a new place.

I understand going into a place to order take out May found silly, but if their website worked I would have saved the trouble, ordered ahead, and probably waited 20 minutes to come in.

After waiting 25 minutes I received my food. It was ok, but I will never get take out from here again. Flagging down someone to order was painful. 

Another reason why I won't order from here again is because I had to order each item separately to get it. When you order the Lunch Special that comes with soup and a soda, to go you don't get the soup or drink. That's half the meal! Why am I paying the same amount and not getting everything? Just plain stupid.I purchased a stress o pedic queen mattress a little over a year ago from this location. At the time, the sales woman was helpful, full of knowledge, and I felt comfortable spending a bit more for a better product from her. Now a year later....the bed is canooing, and incredibly painful to sleep in. Eventhough it came with a 5yr warranty, our friendly sales woman has yet to return our call. As a matter of fact, she's the manager. It doesn't look like we'll be seeing a replacement, or even recieving a call back about our $1,000 bed. Very disappointing to say the least.No only have we waited 8 min for someone to come over and take our drink order.  She tried to tell us we can only have the appetizers in the bar!!!!! WTF GET YOUR MANAGER NOW!!!!!Ok so  they were out of the kinda Bread I wanted, then the young lady told me no one eats that typ of bread any way.  I asked for black olives on my salad and the same young lady, makes a comment about how ucckky that looks and she can't seem look at black olives on a salad.   Today your out of Tuna, the next time your out of cheese, next week the soda is out.  Come On!  One let down after another.......!the problem is that the ac/heat is not working , and WI FI is very slow , if you are business man do not come here cause wifi speed can not let you do anything , so we decide change to other place tomorrow .I had been taking my son here for a long time for a cut because it was cheaper than taking him to my stylist.  He was always happy with this hair and I recently found myself in need of a cut and not enough cash for my regular gal.  A coupon had arrived for a $5.99 hair cut offer, so I grabbed it and went over.
Not super busy during the time I went, but still had to wait a few minutes for one of the ladies to clean up her station.  Totally fine, I don't mind that at all.  First thing she asks is if I want a shampoo - and btw it costs extra.  I told her I've already washed and conditioned my hair today so she can just wet it down before cutting.  This starts the beginning of her complaints.  'Geez, how long has it been since you've cut your hair?'  'Who cut your hair last?' 'Your hair is so nappy!'  
Ok, with that last comment - I'm as whitebread as they come.  Blonde and blue - ergo, my hair is not nappy.  And my African American best friend was both amused and offended that she used that term on me.  The stylist was hispanic, and the complaints about my hair just kept on coming.  It was too hard to cut, my split ends were ridiculous and I really needed more than an inch cut off, etc, etc, etc.  I kind of felt at the mercy of the stylist because I really didn't have the $ to go elsewhere and she had already started cutting.
But here was the BEST part (sarcasm fully intended):  When she was done drenching my hair and cutting it, she proclaimed herself finished and whipped off the cape.  What???  "Aren't you going to dry it?"  Nope.  She offered me a bit of pomade to tame any flyaways, but she doesn't blow dry and there was already another patron waiting.  I had other places to go, and my hair was damp and unstyled.  I was PISSED.
No tip, sweetheart.  Next time you want to sling insults, save it for private time with your sweetheart and don't unleash it on the client.  Good grief.  I won't be taking my son back there anymore, either.Owner is psycho but food is good. If you can ignore psychotic tendencies of the owner and mind your own business it's tolerable. But once again let me warn you, owner is a freak.There is a serious management issue with this location.  Please see all of the other reviews where the lines are too long, the scare tactics to rent insurance and the misrepresentation regarding insurance pricing.  

No need to share a detailed run down of my experience Sunday night (April 14).  Arrived at the rental counter at 7 pm to a long line.   Finally was served 45 minutes later.  By the way, with the long line, some agents clocked out...meaning their shift was over despite 20 or so customers waiting.  This is a management issue. 
Each customer transaction, by my count is about 10-15 minutes.  Other car rentals in my long history of business travel:  Five minutes...even when using the counter vs. express rental.  Again, something is terribly wrong with  Budget's rental process or the company's process at McCarran. 

On Sunday night,  the issue was that the company could not turn over the cars fast enough (the returns and new rentals).  Again, not enough staffing at both ends, when due to reservations, the company can and should anticipate the rush and staff accordingly.  

As a shareholder and customer of this company, I am appalled.Wish I could give no stars!! I enrolled 2011 huge mistake!!!! Thank god I only attended for a month before I withdrew. I studied for the fashion design program basically $80,000.00!!!!! Insane!!! For basic education you get at csn for $300Good rooms and great view (city or strip). BUT  extremely poor house keeping . TV in bathroom did not work for 2 out of 3 nights.  Room service light did not work, as the result the room was not serviced, the next day service light was fixed, but then bathroom was not cleaned, there were stains in the toilet bowl.  The door bell did not work during our entire stay.  The pots, pans, plates provided by hotel were to be cleaned by house keeping, they did not clean those, these were just left over in the sink.

Horrible house keeping and maintainence.  Does not deserve the TRUMP name. This was less than a comfort inn in service.

No Free Wi-Fi - in this day and age this is like asking you to pay for towels.  
Also beware the way this hotel is made YOUR CELL PHONE and USB WI-FI will not work  till you hang next to the big glass windows.Smells like cigarettes.I arrived at the trump to hear that they over booked and want to refund my money and put me up in another hotel. 
So why not right. I didn't know that the manager that promised me that really didnt intend on refunding me my money. 
Basically I had to talk to an array of people to even attempt to get my money back. In the end all they wanted to do is give me another night stay. I had to call my bank to get my money back. Worst experience in a long time. I will never stay at the trump.Very bad service. Bland food. We had to wait forever for even booster seats. Some dishes were okay but some were messed up.This was the worst place I went to. They had pushy rude staff. No players club to speak of, drunk people stumbling into everyone, they naked women were like 50 and not at all thin oh and did I say they were rude and pushy. They really wanted to sell me a drink, not a norm for casino's and it smelled and was loud as HE-- -"You get what you pay for."   I was in the Marc Jacobs forum shop in Las Vegas  in Nov 2008 Thanksgiving week. I purchased a  quilted satin bucket on "sale" as gift.  Well, the plastic handle & the bottom coating peeled off after 4 weeks of  "normal" use.  I had contacted their rep for a credit but was told because the item was on "sale" they do not credit  "final sales."  Why bother to sell an item that doesn't last???   I was very disappointed coming from a high end store.Lovely food, terrible service. Just entered for lunch as the second table of the day. Got water immediately from water guy. Waiter saw me and started cleaning trays behind counter. 5 mins later I made eye contact with him again and back to cleaning trays he went. 5 mins later I left with water guy giving me a 'sorry' look as I exited.They have a bit of a pigeon problemOFFSHORE...at least you got dinner!  We walked in at 9:00, their sign clearly said they closed at 10:00...but we were told that the kitchen was closed!  They must've started cleaning, vacuuming, and texting at 8:30 that night!  We went down the road to Il Posto and had an outstanding dinner and wine...and we've got plans to go back.  Good food or not, I won't go back to Basis New American Cuisine.Service sucks. Ordered a veggie pizza  for take out. 40 min later pizza is not ready.This has been the worst apartment complex I have ever lived in.  Sure from the pictures and at first glance they look beautiful, but once you move in you realize what you see is not what you get. First and foremost, the staff is terrible. Friendly at first until you sign the lease then you will never hear back if you have a question and they back out on promises and statements. They are extremely condescending, lack any form of customer service, and have zero knowledge of property management.  I have never dealt with such asshattery in any of my dealings.   Secondly, the gym is tiny with minimal equipment. Third the apartments are horribly built. Sound echoes thru the halls, walls and ceilings so every step and noise can be heard by your neighbors and vice versa.  Then there is the lack of guest parking that is continually filled with resident cars.  Lastly is the price - WAY to much for what you're getting... There's low income housing across the street, homeless people always lingering, etc. 

Please think twice before choosing this place, it's been such a headache this review can't begin to explain.We got told 10 mins to be seated. 20+ mins later we got called to be seated (around 9:30pm).

25 mins after being seated we got our waters that we asked for AFTER people who got seated after us and who ordered cocktails. Yes, they delivered paid drinks before free drinks. That's how they roll. The guy blamed his bus boy. Way to rip on the place you work.

Food came out around 10:20pm. Honestly, the food was decent. I enjoyed every bite of my L'American burger and fries. When he dropped it off, the wiater said "I'll be right back with more waters." They never came.

An older couple next to us complained to the same wiater about wait times and asked for a full refund on their check. He got a manager and they talked for a bit and got their refund. We didn't want to be a harsh because the waiter is just doing his job. It's the managers fault for overbooking the place.

We straight up told him we didn't want to tip because of the awful experience, but that we'd pay for the great food.

If they're busy, don't eat here. If they add you to a list to be seated, go somewhere else. If they're quiet inside then I'd recommend the food. We expected to be in and out withing 30-45 mins to get our night on in Vegas. Instead we spent over an hour and a half complaining about everything going on around us, from the waiters conversing when people are waiting to big parties getting "VIP" treatment. 

America has butchered Paris!I have been here twice and both times they have messed up on the orders and messed up on the bill. Service is super slow, I think they dont have enough people working. I got my salad 30 minutes before I got the dressing. Dressing doesn't equal dessert.This place is a rip-off. We called to make a reservation on a discounted spa services promotion we had (discount at $69 for a 50 minute massage!) and they took all my credit card information and then tried to charge us another $25 there on the phone for the GRATUITY! How in the world can a place change a $25 gratuity on a $70 service, even before you walk in the door and experience the service? Gratuities are not something you jam down someone's throat, but something that you get because of a quality service. Unfortunately, they told us this only after taking all of our credit card details.I went to the spa 6 weeks ago for a day of pampering (some of the treatments were good and others were just okay).  Well I was overcharged and notified them within a few minutes after they ran my card that they had overcharged me.  I was told that since they already ran my card, that they would issue me a refund within 2 weeks.  I've checked my card numerous times and called 3 times about this and am told the accounting department is processing my refund and that someone will call me back.  No one ever calls me back and now I have to keep checking up on them to get my money back.  Completely unprofessional and I won't ever waste my time or money going there again.  I'm also going to file a formal complaint if they don't issue my refund immediately.STAY AWAY!!!! We spent $3500 on a leather power reclining sofa, love seat, and chair a week before Christmas last year. The love seat when delivered had a soft spot in the left cushion. So, after Christmas I called their piss poor customer service line who said it was company policy to send out a repair man, and they were not making an exception. I went to the store and talked to the manager and complained and they replaced it and I was happy.

After 3 months, the sofa had a cushion that formed a soft spot to the point that it was hard to get out of that seat. I followed company policy and called customer service and they sent out an independent repair man who took pictures and said that he did not know what the company would do but that someone would call me to let me know. He recommended getting replaced because it was so new. Well, no one called me for a few days and when they did, it was a follow up call to ask how my service was. I said nothing had been done, and the rep told me the case was closed because from the pictures the sofa looked fine. So I went back to the store and talked to the manager, who said they would have to attempt to fix it. A different independent repair man shows up a few days later and stuffed pieces of foam between the metal springs and the seat cushion, that was his professional "fix". Remember this furniture is only 3 months old so I went back to the store and after some serious discussion, they said they would replace this piece. I told them I didn't want to go down that road again because this furniture was junk. What I really wanted was my money back but I know that would never happen so I asked if they would exchange it for something of better quality. After some back and forth with the manager and threatening to call 12 for action, they said they would but they would but they wanted another $800 and I would lose the extended warranty. We settle for 2 leather power reclining pieces and one non reclining with no additional money out of my pocket, no extended warranty, and 3 pieces that my wife hates!

If that isn't enough, 10 months after dropping $3500 at this furniture store. One of my love seat is doing it again. And so you know, everyone in my house weighs under 190#'s. I have the "best" that they have and it is nothing but "JUNK".

Please don't waste your money on the junk that this business sells.WOW! What the hell has happened to Half Moon?!? 

This used to be my local sports bar hangout and I was absolutely disgusted with the LACK of customer service last night! I used to come here all the time with my girls for Long Islands and wings. 

It had been months since I'd last made it over there, but now I know I haven't been missing anything! I talked this place up to one of my friends coming up from Phoenix to hang out and left completely embarrassed that I even suggested it! Especially since he works at a REAL bar downtown. He said he left appreciating his place so much more.

Everything was okay for a while after we first got there, but when we went out to the car for a little bit, we came back to a total bitchy attitude from the bartender. We had voluntarily given her a credit card to hold before we went out so there wouldn't be any issues. But when we came back in and my friend asked if he should take his card back or not, the chick turned nasty and was like, "Um, I'm the bartenderrrrr. Sooooo I'm gonna hang on to it. If you're going to be wandering around, then I'm keeping it." with a total bitch attitude. We weren't sure what point she was even trying to make since we had already been there drinking for a while and they didn't ask for a card when we first arrived. And we were pretty much at the pool table the entire time.

 *Side note to the bartenders here* - Usually how these things work is when we order our first round of drinks, you take the card. You ask the customer if they would like to go ahead and close out or start a tab and keep it open. You don't change your mind after we've had 3 rounds of drinks, and THEN all the sudden become a bitch and decide you're going to keep it since you're the "bartenderrrr". (and yes, she said it in that obnoxious, nasally, snobby voice you're reading it in.)

He answered, "I'm just trying to make sure you don't run my card. That's all. I'm not worried about it." And walked away. I was trying to continue to be nice to diffuse their exchange and asked politely if we wanted to order food, should we do it there or just sit down. Now with the rude attitude directed at me, she handed me a menu and said, "Go sit down and I'll come find you." Fast forward to TWO!!! games of pool later and not once had she brought her lazy ass from out behind the bar. Mind you, we didn't even have waters now.  After about 15 minutes of boiling blood and us just looking at each other like, "Is this for real right now?" since it had been 45 minutes, I went to the bar and finally got another chick to make eye contact with me and ask me what I needed. I told her we'd been waiting to order for a while and we were ready. And that the other girl told us she would come find us but hadn't. She cut me off in the middle of me explaining that and ALSO copped an attitude. She said "Okay, what can I get you?" No apology for the wait, and didn't say she'd come take our order right now. She just said it like I knew what my friend wanted too. Um, no. I didn't memorize his order to bring it up to you so that you didn't even have to walk the 15 feet  to the table after we just got completely ignored for 45 minutes. You need to come to the table like a normal server and ask.  After she took our orders, we chatted up the people next to us and told them what was going on. Then they proceeded to tell us that THEIR server had a crazy attitude with them too. They said they were outside smoking on the patio and she was asking if they needed anything and they said maybe in a little bit because they were going to go back inside and her reply (hand gestures and neck roll included) was, "Sooooo. Can I get you guys anything or not?"

After all of this, and waiting for about ANOTHER 45 minutes for our food (wings and a burger! Mind you there is NOBODY else ordering food because it's 11pm on a Sunday!) I asked for a manager.

Drum Roll please.... Guess who?! The second girl that copped the attitude with ME. HAHAHAHA!!! SHE is the manager on duty! SNL skit? Episode of Seinfeld? Punk'd? ......So she delivers the food and we're now complaining to the manager, partially about HER! lolllll

She CONTINUES to have an attitude and make poor excuses for their unacceptable behavior. Only offers to take care of the next round of drinks, not the food. But we just accepted because we were starving at this point and wanted to stop talking and start eating. So she walks away... And the guy next to us said, "Wow, did the MANAGER just really give you that much attitude?! This is ridiculous."

WAIT FOR IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTTT.........

As soon as we take our first bites, ALL of the food is COLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It becomes clear that it had been sitting forever, and most likely it was intentional because we were somehow on their "bad side" because THEY wanted to act hard and have attitudes. We didn't do ANYthing wrong and we weren't rude ONCE.

What a circus. I will NEVER be back after that!The fish and chips taste pretty good.  But the service is the pits and I don't think they turn on the heat in there. It's always freezing. Save your money and skip this place.While in Vegas for my birthday, we visited the LAX Nightclub! If a one word review would suffice, my post would look a lot like this: "whack!" 

Please do not waste your time even if you are staying at the Luxor! We traveled down the strip to come here and this place was a huge FAIL! It was not jumping. I enjoyed Studio 54 better even though it's closed now.

We didn't have any problems with the doormen and luckily we got free passes from the hustlers walking the strip.This place was THE worst! We were just walking around gambling and these huge dude's with ear pieces kept trying to get us to go to "Their New Lounge" they kept hounding us that there was no cover till midnight to hurry and get in. We finally gave in and saw tons more bouncers waiting with nothing to do. There was an empty red carpet and 0 line we walked in and it was dead we figured it may have some amazing original drinks or some shit. They were out of at least one ingredient from every drink on the menu....coincidence, WTF!! No lemon grass but you can have this shitty as glass of champagne w a cherry in it for $15 YAY!! Then we try to leave we wanted some damn DRINKS like those mile long blended daiquiri were sounding really good to us for the trek back to the Venetian. So the "Manager" was trying to keep us there so badly he said he would go and get us the daq's well we were like ok thats cool I guess but he never returned. This place was TEH GHEY!! I had a better time lighting myself on fire once.If you want to spend $15.00 for a 23oz beer then this is the place for you.

We were not impressed by the service or the pricesCompared to other D&Bs around the country, this one is pure crap. 

Where most D&Bs have well planned, permanent eating areas (booths), this one has an empty area with a bunch of tables and chairs thrown in there. There is more comfort and ambiance at Chuck E Cheese!

The food and service here is also worse than any other D&Bs I've ever been to. I think they abducted their wait staff from McDonalds. 

The games are standard, nothing special there. Overpriced as always. 

I suppose if you're some drunk college kid who doesn't know any better, this place is heaven, but for the rest of us it's a waste of time and money.

P.S. I have to laugh at the dumbass who complained about the fact that there are children at an arcade! Oh the nerve!!! How dare parents bring children to an arcade!?!? Get a life snigglenuts!I just read Anna G's review and totally agree with it.  The store has a similar inventory to other similar-sized Sephoras.  However, the beauty studio staff takes the grand prize on rudeness.  The employees in this store need much better training on customer relations.  The only thing this store has going for it is its location and the Sephora name.  If it was in any other location, no one would likely go to this store because of the employees.  Overall my experience here was horrible.  I will always shudder as I walk past this store in future Vegas visits.  I will never encourage any of my friends or family to shop at this store.

I was in Vegas for my friend's bachelorette party.  I had called in two days prior to schedule a makeover appointment for our night out.  I knew I needed new makeup supplies... I'm out of foundation, mascara, powder, I wanted to buy some new eye shadows, etc... I scheduled a makeover for myself too. So my makeover was scheduled for 6 pm and my friend's at 6:30.  I am in general frugal BUT I like to spend money on things that matter.  To me, good quality makeup is an investment so I suck it up and spend $$$ when the time comes to buy.

I got there and this nice older gentleman greeted me.  I asked him where to go for the makeovers and he directed me to the general area.  Although he did not seem to know much about the beauty studio, the fact that he greeted me was a plus in my book.

The ordeal began when I got to the beauty studio area.  There were three girls in the red and black coats chatting up a storm with each other.  I must have looked like someone with no money to spend because I stood there for five minutes in front of them before one of them even acknowledged me.  When I asked about the makeover they looked me up and down, no smile, made me feel like I was intruding, then one of them finally asked had I bought the $50 gift card yet, the cost of the makeover.  

Well it was my first time doing the makeover so I had no idea you had to buy the gift card first.  It turns out you buy the gift card after the makeover!!!!  Per my cousin, the Sephora makeover veteran.

Dutifully, I went to the cashier and paid for me and my girl friend's makeover.  When I got back to the beauty studio area, not one of the girls could be found.  I circled the area a few times and finally another one of the girls came back to the beauty studo area, so I told her I was there for my makeover and I had an appointment.  She had this blank look on her face, no smile, and said she was the one who will be doing my makeover.  She never introduced herself.  It was only later that I found out her name from her manager.  I will not mention her name here but you know who you are.

She said she was finishing up with her other client yet and told me to wait.  I looked around and sure enough there was now someone sitting in a once-empty chair.  I said sure. After all, what could I do?  I understood sometimes things just go behind schedule.  She apparently believed that was the end of her responsibility in customer service since she didn't tell me where to sit nor did she give me any reading material and she pretty much ignored me for the next 15-20 minutes.  Remember my friend's makeover was scheduled for 6:30 pm.  It was now 6:15.  We had dinner reservations at 8 pm.  Time was running out.  She did not seem to be getting done any time soon so I started looking around the display shelves.  I figured being the customer service expert that she was, she would look for me or page me when she was ready.  When I got back to the beauty studio area she was working on someone else. What the???  I looked at the appointment booklet and my name had been crossed off.  What the???

When my friend arrived a few minutes later for her makeover I was fuming.  When my friend found out what happend she didn't want her makeover anymore.  Thankfully management was very appologetic and gave us our refunds.  Thank you for saving me $$$ on this Vegas trip!!!What the heck are the people who rave about this place talking about??!!

Not only are the sandwiches about $10 but we definitely were disappointed by the quality of the food. I got some special they had going that came with the chicken salad pita sandwich and fries. It was about $12....the chicken salad was more of mayo salad with some chicken in it. The only good thing were the fries but come on fries are kind of hard to mess up!
My friend got a chicken sandwich and she was disappointed with how bland it was. Nothing was used to season it...she had to use lots of condiments to make the thing edible.
Oh and they ordered one soda since a small drink at the place is $3.99!!! Yes, really!! This place is just a rip off...definitely not worth for what they are charging.
If you want to find a good sandwich...go to Planet Hollywood's food court that's in that shopping center and stop at the Earl of Sandwich. Now that's a great sandwich place!This place is a total dumpster.  That's how me and my girlfriend always refer to this place.  The owner doesn't even look like he tried to make this place look decent.  I've never been there when it was packed and the empty main room in the back make this place feel like an abandoned warehouse.  Yeah, I get this place has cheap drinks, but there is definitely a reason for that.  I feel like I might contract Hepatitis from stepping into this place.  And those cheap drinks are also ridiculously small.   This place needs to be shut down by the Sanitation Department as soon as possible.Do not ever stay at the Venetian in Las Vegas. They took $15,750.52 out of our account when our room charges weren't even close to that. I could have bought a car with that kind of money. Who has that much money sitting in their bank account?!?! 

The bank is making us jump thru hoops to get the money back. We even have receipts!! Venetian is dragging their feet to refund the money. Are they going to refund all the bounced check charges? What about the time lost from work on the phone trying to get someone to listen and fix it? 

No skin off their backs right? Clearly we will never stay there and will tell everyone that will listen not to stay there as well. 

FRAUDULENT CHARGES!!!!! How is this not a felony?Very disappointed, my girlfriend and I went into this place to try somewhere new, we were immediately met with a snotty attitude from our waiter (Ben). We were told in a very rude way, it wasn't happy hour after we were looking at the only thing on the table, the happy hour menu. Then when my girlfriend asked a question about which fish is in the seafood chowder, again we were met with the snotty answer "seafood" and then a laugh at her question. Can't rate the food as we walked out. The bread and water wasn't bad though.Have a $5 off coupon for a deep dish pizza.  Amanda said her manager would not honor since it was an "old" flyer.  There is no expiration date on coupon/flyer.... how disappointing :(
Ironically, I was born and raised in Chicago, and was craving a great pie.  The attitude of the restaurant was definitely an appetite suppressant .  I miss the attitude of people being a person of there word (coupon, flyer,etc.) and I hope Joey is not the same representation of my experience.
I would gladly pay full price as I always have for the last 2 years!!!  I will not tolerate bad attitude or integrity issues.Doesn't even deserve one star!  Terrible food that we couldn't even finish. Bad service and way over priced!  Save your $$ and appetite for another place.The food was very good. Called for a reservation and was told I didn't need one for the time I wanted 9 pm. I showed up and was told there was no more available tables. I saw plenty of empty tables. So traveling all the way to the Rio off the strip, like I wanted try and find somewhere else at 9 pm. So we sat at the bar, WOW what a romantic evening, NOT. Talked to the manager about it and it was just lies from what I heard from the other wait staff. Don't go here of you expect quality service in the face of restaurant incompetence.I just had a birthday dinner for my mother at don Vito ... I have eaten there before and enjoyed the food and the service... This time I was so disappointed ... The food  was so bad ... They must of changed there Quality of food... We will never be backLong story short, I arrived one hour early for a get-together to set up for party of 16. After one hour of waiting, no table was given to us with lack of communication to us. We did not know that the table was already set up, and we did not know of any "rules" they had about 30 minute wait time and having half the party in order to be seated and all other things they mentioned AFTER all of the party was present. Even the manager seemed careless.

I understand it's near the Strip so it's more crowded than other locations. It's still not okay to act on your own without informing the customers of your decisions.Everything about it was so wrong.  Don't waste your time or money here, it is very disappointing.  

WAIT TIME:  We went for our daughter's 18th birthday mid-week.  The greeter knew this was for a special occasion.  We waited over an hour.  We even opted for the cook table for a faster seating, only to be offered to be seated at a tiny side bar with 4 chairs in a row near the prep area which we declined and continued to wait over 45 minutes more.  

STAFF:  The entire staff seems very young and/or inexperienced, not apologetic or accommodating in any way.  I asked to speak to the manager and had to wait 20 minutes to talk to him.  After speaking to him he told me where I could wait- I had been present at the bar enjoying a beer after waiting for over an hour.  Rude.
  
FORGOTTEN ORDER:  The server forgot the order for my husband, so he waited with an empty plate most of the night until we had to say something to the chef.   If you see an empty plate in front of someone you are serving, would the chef or the waitstaff not be attentive enough to ask what that person ordered?  

APPETIZER:  I ordered a dumpling at the bar when I was waiting there.  It was nothing special, we get the same kind at Sam's Club, frozen. 

THE SOUP:  Very skimpy on ingredients.  Only some very thin green onion slices and one slice of mushroom.  Nothing special, tasted of water and soy sauce, that's about it.   The other party at our table asked for additional mushrooms.  Good for them and they were raw, the chef didn't offer to soften them. . 

THE SALAD:  I enjoyed the Asian dressing.  This was okay.  It's kind of hard to mess up salad.

THE CHEF:  Seemed up tight.  He spent most of his time on the fried rice.  We ordered white rice and when ours came, it was colder than cold.   
I ordered scallops, the menu said they were the sea variety which you expect to be large sized.  When they came they were on the small side, more like the bay variety.  No seasonings were put on these scallops and I had to ask the chef to please give me some onions.  He had served the scallops to me without anything else on my plate.   After 2 hours of waiting.  I would prefer to have the entire meal ready at the same time, promptly and correctly.   This was well after 8 p.m. by now. 

UNDERCOOKED:  The zucchini was not well cooked, on the hard side.  He could have taken some time to steam it to soften it better, but all he did was fry it, which does not make for tender zucchini at all.  My husband ate most of this off my plate, as his plate was still empty.  He did not seem very into his cooking at all.  If you have ever tasted undercooked zucchini you know it is on the sour and rubbery side.  Yuck.  When things are prepared with a good attitude and with attention and care, they are a whole lot better in taste.  The chef dropped some of the utensils on the floor towards the end, he was very not into his craft.     

REFILLS:  I could not get a refill of water and after all the salty soy water soup, I could have used it.  The server was not around much to check this for me.  

SUMMARY:  Did I think this was worth it for a bowl of cold rice, rice water, a few tiny seared scallops, with 2 bites of hard zucchini and mostly a plate of caramelized onions?  What a rip off.  I should have stayed home!  The server tried to make up for his oversight with extra bowls of green tea ice cream.  Our daughter loves it, but I didn't care for the taste at all and neither did my husband.  So my daughter made out with 3 bowls; she does enjoy it.    

CLEANLINESS:  The bathroom:  Yuck!  Trash on floor.  Dirty floors.  

I won't be back anytime soon.   Zero stars if I could.I will grudgingly admit that the yogurt is good at Golden Spoon but the place is absolutely filthy. Has it ever been mopped or had windows or furniture cleaned? I only see one or maybe 2 teenage workers behind the counter -- this owner is maximizing revenue and minimizing staff/cleaning cost. I wrote him a calm, rational email about the cleanliness situation and he didn't bother to reply or acknowledge it. I'm probably done with this place and will seek a self-serve yog shop instead.This place is just plain poor. Even if you get wristbands or free passes, it doesn't guarantee that you will get in. They have no line. Everyone just crowd around the front and push. Even if you're standing in front of the bouncers, you just stand there and move out the way for other people. Here's how you get in 1) if you have a group of 4+girls, get the promoter to take you 2) if you are a guy, you have to, according to the bouncer, "tip" them 3) if you're couple girls and guys, have the girls flirt with the bouncer such as kiss them etc. Is it really worth the trouble? The place is not even worth going to. Just plain poor. My friend had the worst time there and left the place before 12 to go to another place.My mom and I went here this morning (weekday). Paid $19 each (used our players card for a bit of a discount). The only thing decent on the buffet is the toast. Food was cold, gravy was salty, donuts were hard, etc etc. If it wasn't for the omelet and crepe bar we would have left still hungry. Don't waste your time. Too many good places to eat in Vegas for around the same price.I ordered my second Grey Goose  Vodka martini....clearly it was the WELL vodka....when I brought it to their attn, they treated me like I was a rookie vokda drinker....I have been drinking good vodka longer than Jen, the bartender has been alive....nice sassy additude Jen....sub-par service .......again! 
Next time, I will not let clients choose the location!Hate this airport & the limited food options are a big reason why. This place managed to screw up a quesadilla. Which is basically a Mexican Grilled Cheese. Wings are terrible too. Food tastes like it was taken out of a box & cooked in a microwave. The worst part is it's practically the only game in town. Pray for a short layover.I USED TO LOVE THIS PLACE. But in the last year, the place has totally run down its product quality AND its customer service. My last three orders have all had mistakes and were late in delivery. When I called to have the situation remedied, all I got was a  $2 credit on a FUTURE ORDER. WTF?!?!?! You can't get it right the last three times and you think I am going to keep coming back? GET REAL!! Not only have you lost what was a regular customer, I will see to it my friends no longer patronize your establishment either.The worst place I've ever stayed in with the poorest customer service I've ever experienced. I never write reviews and this place just gave me such urge to write my 1st review to warn others. I documented the whole incident for proof: 

03/30/13 around 4:20pm checked in by Cory but the 2 rooms we booked weren't available. Check in was supposed to be @ 4:00pm. I even called to confirm the rooms are ready and are together in the same building. He said approximate wait of 30-45mins. Gave contact info for them to call when they become available. 

@5:38 still no call. Tried calling Worldmark but they hung up on me. Really rude!

 @ 5:41pm called Worldmark again. For the 1st room, spoke w/ Britney and she gave room #2304. But still no 2nd room! Her pathetic excuse was they were still cleaning the room! 

@6:46pm called Worldmark to cancel because the 2nd room still unavailable @ this time. We were on the road for 15hrs and were dead beat, we haven't slept in more than 24hrs, we needed a place to stay yet were displaced so family went to another hotel. Spoke w/ Cory because there was still no call received for the 2nd room. He said he can't cancel the booked room and had to call reservation hotline but they were already closed. 

@ 7:09pm Britney called for the second room. But told her family already left. 

So today we  tried to at least get the credit back for the 2nd room that we never got to use. That's the least that they could do right? Wrong! They were giving us the run-around. I couldn't even speak with the manager. The guy @ the front desk, his name is Raymond, was very apathetic and was insinuating that it was our fault because my family left before the call. Really? They expected us to wait more than 3 hrs to get to the booked room? The 1st room that we got was far from spotless  and I don't want to go into details because that would be nit-picky. One thing they should do though is to change those toilet seats! This place nearly ruined our Vegas trip! We were almost late for a booked show so we didn't get to take a shower or freshen up before going to the strip. This place is also not on the strip as I was expecting. They're 15-20 mins away from the strip. When you're in a hurry, that could seem like eternity. 

Bottom line is: I would never stay here ever again. I'd rather pay top dollar in one of the hotels in the Vegas strip and avoid this place!Go to the one in BH and avoid LV.

The worse service ever!  Came in at 9 pm on a Saturday and seated ourselves in the bar area after being greeted by the hostess.  Received waters in a few minutes and a menu.  Waited another 10 minutes to see a guy walking around with a tray of bread to only have him offer it to the table to our left and then the table to our right.  He did make eye contact as he passed us but did not offer anything.  Another 3 minutes passed and another waiter dropped off a few Parmesan bread sticks out of nowhere at our table.  Another few minutes and nobody to take our drink order or food order so we left.  Passing the hostess as we stepped out she did ask what was wrong.  We told her we were tired of waiting so long to even order.  Mind you the restaurant only had about 10-12 people dining so no excuse that they were just too busy.  Walked around the corner to Del Monico's for a much better experience.  

The indication that the restaurant was empty on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend should have been a big giveaway hint.  And, the "American" kobe???  Is that like a piece of Kobe Bryant's ass?Unfortunately it was recently sold and is no longer the wonderful gem it once was. Very sad.  Don't waste your time or money here.This was the biggest waste of time ever. Not only was it crowded and cold, but for those (like myself) who wanted to leave the show early there was no way out.

I came to treasure island as a kid and remember the show being pretty entertaining... however, things have definitely gone downhill for the sirens of ti. The singing and dancing (if you can even call it dancing) was laughable and the script was even worse. A day later... their main song is still stuck in my head... 

Anyways, even if you're staying at Treasure Island and are getting VIP seating (yeah, VIP my ass) do NOT come and watch this. I guarantee you will be permanently scarred for life.We've been going to Yard House for a long time. We went there for Father's day and it took 35 minutes to get our food, which was cold, and the server didn't seem to care as he cleaned the tables around us.

I work in the service industry and understand it can get busy, but our food had been sitting in the window long enough to change color.

It will be the last time we eat at any Yard House as we've had the same service issues at the Red Rock location.First time going to this location. Took over an hour to get appetizers. Service was terrible. An hour and 5 minutes for wings and oysters is ridiculous. Plates were dirty, silverware had dried food on it still. Wrote the corporate office and didn't get a response. Great customer service.. Not.My husband and I made a reservation here on 2/10/11 for his birthday. Our reservation was for 6:45pm. When we arrived the restaurant  was maybe 40% full. We were seated at a small 2 person table, RIGHT next to another couple. There was maybe 4 inches of space between the tables. The hostess had to pull the table out so a person could sit on the bench side!!! The couple next to use was less than thrilled at 1) we were seated so close in a nearly empty restaurant  and 2) that thier food had taken way to long to come out. We got up and left. Totally unimpressed, will not try this place again, and will not encourage anyone else to eat there.Came in at about 1:00 pm on Sunday, someone came 5 minutes after us, but they took their order first, even though we were ready to order.  Even after they took the other table's order we waited another 5 minutes.  After we ordered, the food took an unusually long time to get to us.  It wasn't that busy.  When we did get our food, they messed up one of the things we ordered.  After finishing our meal we waited a while for our check and it never came.  Food was alright, but the service was absolutely terrible.  After I went up to the register to request the check, I paid for the meal and left a gratuity was appropriate based on the minimal service provided.  I mentioned this to the person that took our money, but she didn't care.  One of the worst restaurant service I've ever encountered.Their policies are horrible.  I found them on priceline as the cheapest since that is what the company I work for wants.  First the place is busy and there is always a long hire compared to the others.  Normally I use Alamo and will be going back to Alamo from now on.  Because I did not take all the insurance coverage they took an additional 200 out on the card which is crap.  Now I am playing the waiting game and if it is not back on my card by Friday I will fight the charge.  They are rude and had to wait for someone to come out of the shack upon returning the car.  They did not ask about the car or anything else.  The guy that gives you the reciept never looked up at me. Not going back do not rent.  Go TO ALAMO.Horrible place once rebranded. Did all you can eat.  Ordered 4 orders of shrimp tempura between two people and was cut off. I have never been to a place that cut you off of all you can eat so early into the meal. Go else where. Policies have changed. Just lost a loyal customer who used to rave about this location.I'm not walking into a club where they wand you, pat you down, and then charge you a $10 cover for an empty bar!  Still searching for that perfect place to go dancing...I wish I could post zero stars but no such luck.  Ordered a curb side order New Year's Eve at 5.40 pm and was told to pick up at 7.15.  It's all good.  Send my daughter to pick up and they are super busy. She waits and waits.  I call at 8.05 And talk with the manager Guermo? Spelling.  He checked into it, called me back, comped the order which was great. Got the order home and the chicken orders were cold and the rice order was GROSS. It literally looked like slop hat was left over. What a disappointment.  Even free is was not with itif there were zero stars that's what they would get. READ THE OTHER REVIEWS, the associates are trained to be SHADY!! I reserved an economy car online for 2 days, $48 (not bad) and when I arrived Jessica at the counter told me it was a 2 door car that may not work for 4 ppl. I upgraded for 10.99 more a day which doubled the total cost of the rental only to find out (from the very nice lady at the car parking garage) the economy is a 4 DOOR CAR that can seat 4 people.  I had to wait in line again to change the rental agreement which she smirked and said "oh I hope it is still available" ummm it's been less than 5 minutes and the nice car park lady told me she would hold the car for me.
Charged me for accidental insurace which she REFUSED to remove, try to scare me shitless about not buying liability and damage insurance. Oh yeah she was also giving the nice foreign family in front of me the same scare tatic and they upgraded to a bigger car too.  
RENTER BEWARE!!I experienced the worst customer service at this shoe store. 

I came to Las Vegas for a work convention and had extra time between work shops so I went shopping. I bought a dress at the BCBG store and wanted shoes to go along with the dress. I saw several pairs of shoes I wanted to purchase and asked the sales woman who was standing talking to a another sales person if she had the shoes in my size 7. I was the only one in the store and they practically ignored me. She didn't even check stock and said she didn't have my size. I asked if she had two other shoes in my size and she said no. The sales person then turned around to gossip with the other sales person. I told her I was sorry to interrupt her 15 minute union break and walked out of the store.

I want others to know of the snobbish attitude of the sales people in this store and not to shop here. If I could give negative stars I would give them -5.My husband and I went here for the first time tonight we are sushi  fans and have eaten at a boatload of places. We were impressed with the stadium seating style. There were 6 huge tv's above the front  bar - each showing a different channel. Each booth had a separate sound speaker so you could listen to the program of your choice. Cool right? We reviewed the menu and decided on the all you can eat sushi for 18.95. Strangely enough - there was no description of what ingredients were used in each roll. Hmm, ok . Well we decided on a few rolls - not knowing what they were - dragon roll? sunset roll? Should we just pick the most expensive ones and hope for the best? Our order came out and it was plentiful. Two huge plates of sushi. I was so excited and  dug right in. The first bite was unfortunate as I believe the sushi might have been bad. My stomach will probably let me know later. It just didn't taste right - sour, old, something was off. I thought i was being picky so I had another. Same odd taste again! I smelled it and not the right smell either. I am really hoping that it was an error in my judgment. What really bothered me was the rolls. Inside each of the rolls was this Costco-style, fake crab stuffing. Each roll had a ton of rice, fake crab/mayo stuff, and a little fish. We were so bummed and reluctantly finished our plates and made a dash for the door. $40 bucks not well spent here - oh well.The 1 star is for
- the place itself, really good looking with a nice open kitchen

The 4 missing stars are for: 
- the most annoying waiter ever! He was constantly around us, I felt like he didn't eat for 2 months and wanted to eat from our plates 
- the food was really "eeehhhh" ( it was the 1st ting that came to my mind), no flavor, oily, and kind of expensive. Only my daughter enjoyed her food! I asked for the salad but I guess the green salad didn't make it to my plate... So I got 1 tomato, 3 basil leaves, 1 slice of mozzarella and 1 tea spoon of pesto for..... $12!!!! Another example? The creme brûlee! It was some vanilla pudding with a lot of caramel on top and all of it in a filo dough that was way over cooked... The price? $10!!! And the waiter wanted to make sure my husband and my kid loved it. He asked 4 times! 
- the owner if the place seems to have lots of friends and invites them with their noisy kids running around, screaming, slamming the doors,... Well you got it...
- the last point is for the seats, they are amazing for TALL people. I'm 5"1... I felt like a kid, my chin was so close from table I could smell the lack of flavor and spices in the food!
Now you know.Two thumps down for Wynn and Encore.

I received a promotional package from Wynn in June, promising two complementary show tickets for two nights stay, which induced me to make a reservation for thanksgiving. At the time of the booking, Wynn web site listed the two show tickets as part of the deal. However, it did not let me choose the way to get the tickets. I figured that they would give me the tickets when I check in.

Well, today I just called to book the show time because we will also have a Grand Canyon tour on the same trip. The woman at concierge told me that they blocked the show tickets for thanksgiving in October, and that if I had called earlier, I would have gotten the tickets. She even commented that for complementary things in life, I should have been more proactive in pursuing them. 

I was not happy after learning of this. For God's sake, I made the reservation in June before they gave the notice of the blackout dates. Had I known that thanksgiving holidays was blocked out, I probably would not have booked.

Granted that the room rate I received was probably still a good deal even without the tickets, but it just left a bad taste in my mouth. It is not about the money any more. I felt being taken in. I guess that it is just that sense of not being fair. They promised something, but failed to deliver. I even recommended some of my friends to go using the promotion code they gave me. It is difficult to find another hotel now that it is so close to thanksgiving, but if there is a deal on Groupon, I will for sure take the advantage of it, and cancel my reservation at Wynn.Casino is tacky as hell.  I think they ran out of money when they built it.  Wynn is gorgeous and quit.  Encore is loud, red, and cheap.This business is in direct violation of its merchant agreements with credit card vendors because it charges between $.10 to $.20 PER GALLON more if you use any credit card other than their Valero brand card.  

If you are also frustrated by this business practice, you can report it to the credit card companies.

MasterCard: 1-636-722-4527Total scammers.  Car was running when I took it in, almost $3000 later it's not.  An engine problem became a transmission problem.  And the GM Frank was mad we took the car back today because of course they wanted MORE money for causing more issues than they fixed.  I'll be fighting these guys in court if I have to.  STAY AWAY!Bad hotel coffee shop.  Food is just bad. Service slow, inatentive, and poorly trained.  They are clueless........Ambiance is terrible inside......we were there at night....during day can sit outside in pool garden area..which I'm sure is pretty........and drinks are very thin......order beer or wine.   Do not go unless your staying in hotel........it makes a very poor statement about marriot At desert ridge.....
not worth wasting time on reviewingCalling this establishment a zoo is equivalent to cutting a hole out of a garbage bag and putting in on, claiming it is a dress. You can pretend and protest all you want, but a garbage bag is not a suitable dress, and this place is NOT a suitable "zoo".

The website does a fantastic job of tricking you into thinking you will be seeing lots of happy exotic animals...but when my friend and I arrived we found the opposite.  We seriously thought it was an elaborate prank! The entrance/gift-shop looked like a small single family home that had been converted to just that.  We could have easily just walked in without paying because when we went up to the ticket window no one was there...but we pondered too long and a lady finally showed up to rob us of our money.

The zoo was full of pigeons and chickens just running around free and wild...which wouldn't matter that much if they were not missing half their feathers and looked sad and diseased...it was gross and depressing.  There were not that many animals here at all, and the lion was lying in his "den" and we were not even able to see him.

Definitely skip this place when you visit Las Vegas...unless you actually like seeing sad depressed animals in the dusty desert.we came here for show around 9pm. The service is not too bad, but food is hard to swallow. Food is way to salty, very few choices.If you like being attacked by pushy, overbearing sales women, and paying high prices for average quality clothing, then this store is for you.  
The moment I entered the store I had a sales woman breathing down my back and shifting my attention away from the sales racks and towards the high end section of the store (this happened on the 3 occasions I was at the store).  It's way to obvious that these people work on commission.  
Regardless,  I found a great pair of jeans I was very much in love with and l left the store happy.   I paid $125 for these jeans, after one wear they began to tear and a rivet fell off the back pocket.  I went into the store to exchange them 4 days after I purchased them and the manager was very condescending and rude about my return, she tried her best to convince me that the quality of the jeans was my fault.   Once again I was guided by the sales people to the clothes they think I should be wearing despite what I am telling them. Frustrated with the way I am being treated I hurry to find something so I can get out of the store.  i end up very unsatisfied with my purchase.  I would not recommend this store, shop online if you have to just dont shop here.Grimaldi's, I love your food, but your customer service is horrible, therefore I am forced to rate you as a 1. Let's take last night as an example. I went to pick up my large pizza and a salad. I saw my pizza come out, I saw two guys opening the box,  looking at the pizza and discussing something. One guys comes over to me, quickly opens the lid and says "isthisok?" (yup all in one word.) I said "uhh yeah, I guess so"... "but wait it looks a little small to be a large." He says - oh yeah it's between a medium and a large, but we will give you your salad for free. So, if I would have said "yes, it looks fine," they would have left me walk out of there with something less than what I paid for?! Plus now I have a pizza that will not fill up my family? When I ask for a new pizza he grudgingly says "well its gonna take 20-25 minutes." So, I leave... with a small pizza and a crappy wilted salad... and don't expect anyone to hold the door for you either... they are all too busy gabbing around the guest kiosk.

Ps- this is the 2nd time my order was messed up and I must say even Domino's and Pizza Hut have never messed up my pizza size or toppings!There are much better, and not hard to find.  

Where to start... Salsa tasted like it was out of a jar, then chips were littered with crumbs like they were poured out of the bottom of a bag...  So far right on par with Taco Bell... 

Next came the entree's (we skipped the apps literally after tasting the store bought salsa..).  We tried a sampler platter which was mostly inedible... although I have to say the sauce for the tamale was pretty tasty... (that was it)

The salad was a pretty large, with a decent amount of ingredients... chicken literally tasted like it was thawed then thrown on the top, it was completely flavorless. The dressing was some chipotle mayonnaise mix...   Taste was a 2/10 at best.. left more than half on my plate, and had no interest in taking the rest home... 

I should mention there was live music when we were there, but don't expect upbeat, it was a dreary mix of Neil Young and Simon and Garfunkel and alike.   

The service was quite good, they were both attentive and well mannered, and the best thing going for the restaurant.

I live less than 2 or 3 miles away and can never see returning for sure.  I was happy we used a Local Dines certificate, it made the visit marginally less painful.arrived at 9:30pm when they clearly closed at 10pm according to the posted hours on the window. door was locked and the 2 employes inside just stared at us, couldn't even come to the door to apologize for closing early. won't be returning.Our group got food poisoning from eating here. The service was great, but we got so sick afterwards we can never come back. 

Stay AWAY! there are many other options for eating in the VenetianPros:
Ordered delivery, got here fast

Cons:
Wings were clearly freezer burnt.
Garlic "Flavoured" crust had no flavour
all the toppings (with the exception of pepperoni and cheese) were in a 2 inch circle in the middle of the 2 pies we got
Crust was very hard for being a pan crust
After all was said and done (2 pies and an order of wings), it was kinda expensive for the quality.

This place has taken the top spot on my pizza to avoid list, dethroning domino's.FRAUDULENT DUDES- THESE GUYS GIVE VEGAS A BAD NAME! Been there twice.  First time was pretty standard - service was nothing memorable, good or bad.  They have a nice waiting area.  Second time was a different story.  DISHONEST - they partnered with All American Auto Glass.  These folks (in the red tshirts) offer to fix chips in windshields, at now extra cost, before the actual car wash employees greet you.  A very young-looking guy named Matt found two chips in my windshield - I had never seen them before.  They took my insurance card and got the service approved for me, which I thought was a little strange, but whatever.  I'm watching various blue tshirt employees (car wash) work on my car, but neither Matt nor anyone else from All American Auto Glass do anything to my car.  They then tell me my car is done.  I told him the chips had not been sealed.  Matt said he did, but when I asked him to run his finger over the windshield, he then sealed it for me.  He then started laughing at me when I asked to speak to his manager.  

Filing a Better Business Claim and already alerted my insurance company.They forgot the cheese on my breakfast sandwich. I had to repeat my order like 3 times, once to the first lady at the counter, then again at the register, then they asked again if I asked for sausage or bacon. The organization is terrible. Also ordered a coffee and had to walk all the way around and back to where I first ordered to get cream and sugar (and silverware). Pretty disappointing for Venetian standards. Never again.The other guy that rated this Subway was right on target. Not only expensive ($3 for a bottle of Pepsi and $11 for a footlong sub) but it is very slow service, dirty inside and no where to sit in the area. To top it off the short lady cutting the bread is probably the rudest fast food employee I have even run across 

My suggestion is to keep walking toward the C-7 gate and the are 5 or 6 clean - nice restaurants.Horrible customer service. It wasn't busy at all, and they weren't short-handed. It took them 15 min to make a half sized chicken salad. I watched them as they stood around and chatted amongst themselves, and one girl had an "I obviously hate my job" kind of look on her face. When the girl finally brought it out to, she didn't even look at me or say anything- just set it in front of me and walked off. The salad consisted of chicken, walnuts, and dressing. A very complicated salad that I'm sure needed 15 min to make, and not to mention- way overpriced. I've been in the food service business for 7 years, so I know how this thing goes. I will never go to one of these places again.Only one thing I can say for this place GROSS.I went in to Cafe Truva to buy a box of chocolates - which they have nicely arranged at their front counter - as a gift. I've never reviewed anything before, but felt I had to in this case.

The man who served me was quite rude, and said a couple of times that I should be quick as he was busy - even though I'd only asked how much a small box was. He then suggested I get an already made up box, which I wasn't keen to do as they were quite dusty - but he was quite pushy so I did so.
When I took them out the bag half an hour later I realised that the box lid had been stuck down with a sticker that had then been torn open and stuck back down and that the bottom of the box was scuffed with paper ripped off and 2 of the corners were bashed in - it looked like I'd had it in my flat for about 3 months after opening it up and deciding I didn't like the contents, and so was impossible to give as a gift. It's a shame as the chocolates looked very nice and high quality.

The Chocolate Tree in Bruntsfield and Luca in Morningside are both brilliant chocolate shops and cafes I'd highly recommend, with very friendly service.When the guy who named this place the 'best' kebab house has a child I'm betting he will call it something like Dr. Cure-Cancer. He will then go on to be suprised when the child fails his first exam and drops out to become a kebab shop owner instead.

Thats the sort of dissapointment you will feel when entering this kebab shop. The food is poor, the service is poor and overall the price is poor.

Not a great place, certainly not the 'Best'.YUCK! 

 We went here for sunday brunch, expecting something substantial to satisfy our hangovers, and a nice cold bloody mary. Instead we got overpriced child sized portions of average mexican food, the most disgusting bloody maria I have ever had in my life(it was sweet and tasted like ketchup-barf!), and RUDE service from the waiter. He brought us all yet another round of the vomit-inducing bloody marias  (they were 2 for $10) and refused to make a substitution. When I politely explained that none of us liked the bloody marias as they were too sweet, he ARGUED with me in broken english and then finally bought us a round of margaritas when we were done with our two bite meals. By the way, the margaritas are gross too. Oh, and as you walk in the door you are greeted by some guy who tries to get your information for their email list and there was some chick on a microphone yakking away the whole time about drink specials, trying to drum up business. This place is a ripoff and with so many other fantastic restaurants in vegas you would be much better off somewhere else....I'd even rather eat at the circus circus buffet. And that's bad...but at least I would not leave feeling violated.I have been going to RZ Salon for a decade. I pay the high prices because when Amy wants to she can really give a great cut. IT IS hit or miss though. I often feel I should apologize to Amy for just being there. Today I could not take her attitude any more. I felt talking to her briefly about how to cut my hair was impossible. She was rude and dismissed  me. She started cutting my hair though we were at odds with what she was going to do. I had to leave. If you want to pay $70 for a haircut I'd suggest going someplace that will be nice too. Amy's shampoo is nothing special either.Probably the worst service I've ever had. Been here for 2 hours and still haven't received my dish. Took over 45 minutes to get a Sprite. None of my party have received the correct dish. Asked for the manager at least 5 times and he won't show his face. I'm generally a patient person but this place is really trying my patience.Meh. Over-priced, and the people who work there are never friendly.This is a terrible bar!  Terrible!

They drove out all of the good staff due to the owners insane rants.  They have a strange smell, their "pints" aren't, they are in undersized glasses to "look" like pints.  They are over priced, and the food quality has seriously suffered in the last year.  Save the trouble and go next door to san tan brewery!They just shoved us on to a tiny table in the corner.  Half the restaurant is open but they refuse to move us.  We are too tired to leave so we deal with it.I love Paradise Bakaery's Spinich Power salad, except I make a few modifications to it to suit my liking.  I never get bacon, i add red onions and diced tomatos and always get the balsamic vinegarette dressing.  For the past 3 times that I have gone to this PB location they have not gotten my order right.  I usually check my order before I leave but today I was careless and was disappointed to get back to my office to have my salad not made how I ordered it.  It was apparent that the salad was made traditional style with no regard to how I ordered it.  I will not be going back to this location since they do not pay attetnion to their customers orders.  Having the wrong lunch defintiely puts a damper on the remainder of my workday.

I will continue to go to other PB locations that you watch as your salad is prepared and pay last!!!

I also love the paradise pasta salad but I do not know what was up with it today.  It actually tasted bad - like something in it was not all too fresh! I got a large order had about two bites and it was just so terrible tasting!

I had the worst experience at PB today which really upsets me since is one of my favorite lunch spots.WOW!! What a Horrible experience!!!
I have been eating at this Chilies for about 20 years now! I've always had a good to pretty good experience, but this time it was just Horrifying!!! 

The food came out tasting awful! We are Done giving Chili's a chance! We will NOT be back!!!Avoid it if you can!I have been here about 6 times. First 3 visits after opening the food and service was beyond excellent. Last visit was nothing short of ridiculous, we sat around 20 minutes before I had to get up and complain for lack of service. Food portions seemed to be skimmed down.Came to this McDonald's Friday, 7/5/13, forgot to check in though, lol!! 

Anyways, McDonalds is suppose to be a family joint right?!, especially when they have the playland, well how is it that this place, knowing people come with kids off all ages, NOT have a changing table in the restroom???? Unbelievable!! 

I will say though at least this place is clean and nice but what I dont like is that they dont have a ketchup dispenser they just have ketchup packets, I personally don't like that all.The food was good, I ordered some pho and my friend order the egg rolls, we all had fun but in the end one of us got food poisoning, so I will not be coming back to this placeWe went there this weekend for lunch.  Almost $30.00 for 2 of us for food that wasn't worth it.  Chicken....lots and lots of chicken, I didn't see much else except meatloaf.  Pizza crust was limp and soggy.   Mostly the reason I give such a low rating is the price and both of us got sick afterwards.  We will never go there again.Nasty beef lo main #nasty egg rolls taste like theres curry and something else....oh no meat when we cameWent in tonight after a big win at the casino wanting to celebrate.  The two bartenders didn't seem to care when me and my friends drinks were empty.  I was willing to drop some serious money but concidering I'm not a regular I'm guessing it doesn't matter.  I tipped the food server a 200% tip because she was the only reasonable employee in the place.  I talked to the manager Kerry and he seemed to empathize but did nothing to try to retain my business.  I don't come in every night but when I do am willing to drop at least $100 I guess they don't have to worry because $0 of my money will be spent there.  Worst customer service ever at a local bar.Supper Slow service, food are expensive bad service.We too had eaten a here under the last owners and loved it. My gosh has this place gone to crap. No service, they plate your selections and the meats were both floating in this bloody ice water as the "hostess" grabbed out a small finger bowl and set it aside. My wife nearly got sick just looking at it as we stood there for 5 minutes alone waiting for a cook. So we just walked out. 
Again, no one to greet you, no explaination of the new process, very gruff when talking to anyone. they grab the ingredients you ask for and try to short you on meat for a set $11 price for one serving. 
Plus they advertise hot dogs and hamburgers, buffet mexican food? At Kosher-mongo BBQ? WTF? Absolutly horrible experience to see such a good place turn to this. I will warn everyone I see to stay away.
I think the health dept would be intrested in how the meat is keep.My friend book a panorama room for her 21 B-day party, but when we arrived to the hotel, the room they gave to my friend are totally not match what my friend suppose to have. My friend have been book the room like month ago, and now they just said the room have already been book by another person! What the H! They didn't give any notification during this time,  they just gave us an other low quality room!the service quality is extremely bad to my friend, we are not satisfy on it! Never come to this hotel again!!!Waited 15 minutes and no waiter ever came to take our order. Walked out. Horrible service!I demanded and received a refund. Had to wait 10 minutes for the refund since cashier is not allowed to void a check and there is no manager in the restaurant.  Smallest buffet ever.  Weekend brunch was more like a continental breakfast. They renamed the hotel QUAD instead of Imperial Palace but this room looked every bit of 40 or more years old.  Caesar's should be ashamed they continue to leave this place open. It's an embarrassment. Go to Harrah's buffet next door!I am from Japan, and know Japense food.  Red Koi is a typical non-Japanese owned pseudo Japanese restaurant.   I went there once for dinner, and it'll be my first & last time to go there.   Food tasted just like food court pseudo Japanese food with much higher price tag.Worst steak burrito, ever.  Worst $9 spent. Barely any meat. All I tasted was the tortilla. The meat was dry, but what can you expect from an airport restaurant? I should have ate burger king. Yuck.Went to the new one on Eastern in Henderson.  Not good at all!  Texas toast only toasted on one side.  Had a BBQ Sandwich which consisted of soggy Texas toast, pickles an onions on the side and two tough rib bones with BBQ sauce on top.  Really?  And they are trying to charge Lucille prices!  They plaster this special deal on their window and it is nowhere on their menu.  You have to ask about it.  Then, this is what you get.  So glad I didn't spend more.  I don't mind spending 80 bucks at Lucilles, but not here.  Never again.They shut down about 6 months agoDeeply disappointed. I came here with a few girlfriends because we were hungry and wanted to try the frozen hot chocolate. I ordered the veggie burger and it was a mess. It took about 30 minutes to make and when I finally got it, the burger fell apart. Right when I picked it up, the bun crumbled in pieces as well as the burger!! The black bean patty was bland and the frozen hot chocolate was just ok. I will not be coming back or going to the other serendipity for that matter. I don't understand all the hype.My bridal party and their dates made a special trip out to Serendipity 3 the night before my Mandalay Bay wedding and had, quite possibly, the worst experience I've had at any restaurant ever.  Their staff was rude and inattentive.  Our server, who ignored us most of the time we were there, spilled some kind of disgusting cream all over me (in my bride shirt and sash) and offered no apology or even extra napkins.  All we got was an, "oops" and smile.  Absolute garbage.  The manager, who was slovenly in his appearance, and couldn't be bothered when there were pretty girls in his view, ignored our request for more napkins and neglected to say a word to the server who spilled all over me.  We paid a total of $70 for flat and warm beer (which took 25 minutes to get to our table) and a couple of alcoholic frozen hot chocolates that were so full of flavored syrup, you couldn't taste anything else and a disgusting cream shower from an inattentive, rude service staff.  After our check arrived, we tried to speak to the manager again about our ruined visit (we ended up just leaving our drinks and dessert because I had to go clean up), he offered us no break in the check, an apology from our server or anything else. Oh, he did offer us something...one shot for one person in our table of 6 to make up for it.  Definitely disappointed.  This was one thing I had on my "must-see" list and made a special trip out on my last night out before my wedding to be there...and it was ruined by a rude staff, flat beer and an oblivious manager.  Save your money and get a milkshake from McDonald's.  This place is not worth the wait, cost and disappointment that is sure to follow.  Two thumbs way down.Hot deli services review only!

I really hate how disorganized the hot deli service is at 168. There no sign that tells you where the line is for ordering/paying. There are times when I just walk up to the cashier and order. So, I decided to get in the same line to place an order and when I reached the front, the cashier girl tells me to get out of line and get in another line to order the food. WTF! I don't understand why she can't just pick a few items to the left of her that I needed. It was really pointless to get out of that line when, what I needed was right next to her. All I know is that I will never order food from that place ever again!!!!!Went on a Saturday evening for a friends birthday.  Horrible customer service with the exception of one very petite hostess who greeted us as we walked by her podium.  I absolutely hate the idea of handing over my credit card for the waitress to hold on to until we are ready to leave.  (Even though we would be paying cash)  I thought the strippers showed up but it turns out they were the bouncers.  Apparently bouncers don't know how to talk to people, just get in somebody's face and yell and push.  Situations could be handled more efficiently, say take aside the person who booked the party and tell them what the problem is and take care of it from there.  Don't go off and throw out everybody who stands up and wants to know what the heck is happening.  We had to wait at least twenty  minutes for waitress to bring our bill when we were ready to go, and then find out the tip was already added in.  Two beers and an appetizer $39.  Do we need change?I (used to) love this bar, but it's gone downhill in terms of service and clientele. We went out for a friend's birthday last night and I was surprised to find that a bar that prides itself on being a neighborhood-type, country bar now charges a cover. (For guys, at least.)

I love the live band and last night was no different. They rocked. I was disappointed to find that the crowd was nearly half the size of what I remember though. The place used to fill up. Maybe it's the cover that's turning people away? 

Or maybe it's the bad service....

At the end of the night, we had a difficult time flagging down one of the many bartenders to close our tab because they were preoccupied with cleaning up. When we finally got one's attention, she rolled her eyes, asked for our last name and then replied: 'You opened your tab wayyyy on the other side of the bar.' She rolled her eyes again and then reluctantly fetched it, because, you know, that's her job, and then slapped it down on the bar top before us without so much as a thank you.

We noticed there was a charge for a Jack Daniels ($8.50 for one BTW. Forgot to mention that their prices have gone up.) we never purchased and when we brought this up to another bartender, we got the same amount of attitude and not a single apology. 

I've worked in the service industry and certainly understand how, at the end of the night, you're more than ready to clean up and get out of there, but that's no reason to treat your patrons so poorly, especially since the crowd appears to be thinning.

I don't know that we'll be heading to Toby Keith's anytime soon. I'll take a good DJ over their fabulous live music if it means I'm tended to by a mixologist who makes me feel welcomed and appreciated. And maybe one who smiles. :)Management is rude and incompetent. They enjoy raising rent for no reason at all even if you have been a long time tennant with no complaints and have never been late once. They are wonderful at losing paperwork and demanding payments that you can prove you already made. Lets not mention that the place is unsafe.. I know of at least 4 break ins and attempted sexual assaults in the past 2 years i've lived at Whispering Ghettos.Back to my belief that service needs to weigh heaviest on expectations in the "service industry," I've got to share an experience at Local Breeze from a recent visit.  My friend ordered a salad without the bacon, but the kitchen apparently missed this request and made it the normal way.

Fair enough.... accidents happen. But as we then tried getting the server's attention to fix the situation, he was less than responsive. Finally, after my friend had picked around at her salad for a while and the rest of us finished our meals, the waiter insisted on bringing a new salad. My friend declined the replacement since it had already taken so long and asked, instead, that it be removed from the check. After much ado from the service staff/manager, this was the agreed upon solution.

But when the check came, there was a miscellaneous charge of $6.... That was for the portion of the salad that our friend ate. Serious!?!?!? The restaurant would not back down from this position, so they got our $6 and will not likely get another dime. Ever.

Too bad... Local Breeze otherwise seems like a nice place with decent food. If only they were better at being a restaurant, I would fully support them.I have no clue why this place has such a good rating. It makes me wonder if they are paying people to write good reviews. 

I went here with my girlfriend and her mother and was very disappointed. When we arrived, we were instructed to seat ourselves, which I do not have a problem with because this is the way it's done in New York at a place like this. It even added to the authenticity of the restaurant. 

We were given menus and after figuring out what we wanted to order, the host came over and took them, but without taking our order. We waited another ten minutes before the waitress came over, without asking if we wanted more drinks, I might add. 

We ordered a beet salad, some veal raviolis, a mushroom pasta and sausage raviolis for the table, as we wanted to share. The only thing that was close to palatable were the sausage raviolis. However, I could only bear to eat a couple as they were over salted. All the pasta was way too al dente for my taste, maybe even being undercooked. The mushrooms in the wild mushroom pasta were obviously dried and not fresh. I could tell because it seemed like they didn't cook them long enough as they were very chewy. The veal raviolis were the worst part. They were bland and fatty, along with the pasta being undercooked. 

After we finished the beet salad, the plates just sat on the table, taking up space until just before our entrees came out. That kind of thing is very bad form in a restaurant. 

After we decided that this place is just horrible, we wanted to leave ASAP. We had to yell at the waitress across the dining room to get our check because she was having a very extensive conversation and was not paying attention to any of her tables. We then explained that we were not satisfied with the veal raviolis. To her credit, she did have them taken off the bill, but not before talking to us like we were a bunch of toddlers throwing a fit. I'm still not sure if she was being sarcastic with us or she genuinely thinks people enjoy being talked to like that. 

Overall, this place is a disaster. I absolutely do not recommend eating here.I ordered my usually "white peach by starbuzz" I waited for about 15-20 mins and received my hookah to only be let down.

They use instant lights :( not only does that later the flavor but it also makes the hookah have a chemical taste 

I'll never purchase a hookah from there again !Several good reviews on here, but my one experience was not.  Food was mediocre Thai.  I understand the modern fusion twist, but I have had dive Thai places much better than this.  Shared several dishes among companions, like drunken noodles, salmon, chicken satay, etc.  Food was not good value for the price $.  For what I consider one of the newer casinos in Vegas, the service was too slow.  Left the restaurant hungry.  I'm all for second chances, but with so many other choices in Vegas why would I come back?yuck.  I love eating.  I love food.  Not finishing my plate is a rare event.  My red curry was almost all cheap, hardly cooked onions.  The sauce did not taste like curry, and they had Chinese zodiac menus on the table.  I can accept many flaws, but there was not a single redeemable quality here.The staff is attentive and friendly, but this place is Absolutely a rice lover's heaven... AYCE rice, rice, and more rice with paper thin whispers of mediocre fish artfully applied to disguise the RICE... I would have to be Krazy to return. To many great sushi bars, so little time...---------------CUSTOMER SERVICE REVIEW ONLY--------------
This is a rant but you know what, filter me for all I care but it's a valid rant. 

My first interaction with these folks was an email that said "RESERVATION CANCELLED"...which was conveniently 3 DAYS BEFORE I'm even set out to fly this weekend. In the email they stated that they tried to get a hold of us because apparently the CC on file kept declining (long story on that but thanks a lot for that one Amex). They tried to get a hold of us?! Shoot, did we miss a call? Did we miss an email? No calls, and after going through all our emails, we found their ONE contact email in our spam folder. 

It was titled "cc decline" from Bailey Roberts. Who the hell is Bailey Roberts?  Doesnt even say Jet Luxury Resorts unless you were to open the spam-looking email. Doesn't even bother to capitalize your subject lines (normally I don't care but if you're a professional company, use proper grammar). FROM THE ONSET, THAT ALREADY LOOKS LIKE SPAM and NOT professional. Turns out, the email was sent 24 hours prior that simply said they needed a new card. First off, sucks that it got sent to spam because it LOOKED like spam mail but man, you don't even bother to try a second time?

Here's why I'm really pissed off. This hotel was booked 6 months ago yet they cancelled on us last night. You're telling me we could have easily resolved this in the past 6 months but decided to not let us know there was a problem until the week of?

Btw, the reservation was for this coming weekend which happens to be Memorial Day Weekend. Not sure if you've heard of this holiday but it's pretty big. Which also means, when you're booking a new hotel reservation 3 days away from a big holiday weekend, your prices are now almost 100-120% MORE than what you would have paid if you booked 6 months ago. Should've booked 6 months ago. Oh wait, WE DID DO THAT! And then we got it cancelled on us. 

And yes, it's our bad that we had a CC snafu so I understand that but man, couldn't customer service have tried harder than sending a hapless email?

Thanks but no thanks.The food is BAD and so DISAPPOINTED! I feel awful to write this. But we all work hard for a living. When we pay to eat out.....we do expect it to taste good. 

Orange Chicken - Over cooked and was so stringy. Couldn't enjoy it at all. Sauce didn't taste right either. Very bland. Didn't have that slightly spicy orange sweet flavor.

Egg Fried Rice - NO flavor whatsoever. I added that sweet red sauce to it, which made it taste a lot better. 

Crab Puff - I actually think this is the only thing I liked. 

Beef and Broccoli - Overcooked and no flavor, per family member who ate it. 

Chicken in Garlic Sauce - My BF ordered it. The chicken was cooked well and it tasted good. He wanted spicy, and it was spicy. 

Egg Drop Soup - Bland, no flavor. Worse we all have ever had.

Again I feel bad having to write a very negative review. But having to wait an hour and a half for delivery of the food (took 30 min longer than it was supposed too) and costing $35 for the 3 of us to eat. It was a waste of money. I wish we had gone elsewhere.I enjoy Great Dane Pub's in Madison but I will never go back to this one. The service is absolutely horrible and the bartenders are extremely rude. Stay away.Thought I'd write a review because I've been here more than 45 minutes waiting for my takeout order. 

This place is as poorly run as it comes. Overpriced. Good food, but very disappointed that it's taken 90 minutes to fulfill a take out order.

You don't mess with a man and his food. Especially when it's chicken n' waffles.Haven't even moved in yet and I am having customer service issues!

The complex itself seems perfect for what my roommates and I are looking for; however, we signed a lease, aren't scheduled to move in until tomorrow and already the problems are already rolling in. 

To be elligable to rent from san portella, you must make four times the rent per month.  My room mate and I passed this guideline and signed a lease together.  Not once did they mention we had to pick up our keys together.  I talked to them today around 5 pm. they said My roommate Sara and I had to sign this paperwork before given the keys.  Since Sara works all day tomorrow until 5 and I can only move in the morning, this posed as an issue.  I called Sara asking if she can make it down there before they close today and she said yes.  She called me around 5:20 explaining there was traffic and she probably wouldn't get there until right at 6pm.  I called San Portella, talked to Layla and explained that Sara wouldn't be able to get there until 6pm because of traffic.  "Is that okay?" I asked.  Layla said no, we have strict community guidelines and we close at six.  I explained that Leah, our san portella rep never explained that we had to be there together to pick up the keys and we have relatives with work schedules who are helping us move that we have to accommate including our own work schedules, since it is the evening before moving in, can you be the least bit helpful under this unique situation?  Layla said no.  I spoke to the manager who was very rude and cut me off while I was speaking to put me on hold.  I contacted their customer service representative, but she didn't answer so I left a voicemail.  

It is unfortunate that I haven't moved into San Portella yet and I am already having customer service issues.  I work with customers all the time with my jobs and I am very understanding that the workers want to go home right at six, but I would never speak to a customer in the rude way the manager spoke to me, I would never cut off a customer to put them on hold and I would definitely stay open a few minutes passed closing time if an employee didn't supply valuable information.  

Moving is stressful enough and dealing with San Portella's lack of customer service skills just adds to the stress.This is right around the corner from my store so I go here often to get the guys something to eat. Lately the drive thru has been running slow. This morning was the end! Pulled in and ordered, sometimes their screen isn't working and there isn't a display; this was one of those times but the girl repeated my order back correctly. Pulled forward to wait......and wait.....and wait. 22 minutes later the car at the window pulled away. When I got to the girl held out her had for money; no apology, no explanation or anything.
I work in a service industry too but I would never NOT acknowledge that the people in line had been waiting an excessively long time. I asked what had been wrong as I paid and was told the car at the window had changed their order. So why weren't they parked while it was prepared and then brought out to them so the rest of us could get going? 
To  add insult to the whole thing I was then handed the wrong order. And told it would be a couple minutes to get what I had ordered together. I asked for the manager, told her I wanted a refund. She gave me the pat lame answers that tell me she really isn't management material. "There was nothing she could do about the wait." Got news for you sweetheart, as management it is your job to solve problems, stave off disasters and think outside the box. I know, I started in a fast food place and now I own my own business (different industry but still its service oriented).
I am truly disappointed in how this was handled. There are a thousand fast food places, now I wont mind driving around the corner because I wont be going back to Carls JR.The city center was amazing!  The Mandarin Oriental hotel  was understated and well done... you'll be shocked by the wall you see when the elevator opens on the 3rd floor.

We had lunch at the MOzen, and we very pleased with one exception I'll get to.  I asked the waiter if the sandwiches were cut in half because we wanted to share, and he helpfully brought the plates each with one half of the sandwich.  The pulled pork was good, and the club sandwich was interesting though impossible to eat because of the thickness of the bread.  Since we were also served a tiny appetizer along with french fries and onion rings, it was a good value as well. 

That is, EXCEPT for the $18 charge for two ice teas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  At first we wondered if maybe the ice teas they kept bringing out were being charged separately, but the bill just said "2 ice teas."  And no, they weren't Long Island.  Interestingly, you won't find the price they charge for things like soda and ice tea anywhere on the menu.

The service was excellent and the food was good, but we won't be back.  Sneaking in a charge like that is inexcusable.I went here anticipating a great happy hour and wondering Emeril Lagasse Food. Instead, when my wife and I arrived at the door, the hostess asked if we were "lost or just looking around". Immediately, this was an insult since you have to go downstairs at the Palazzo and the only thing down there is the Stadium. We entered and went to the part for the online advertised "Tail Gate Party" which ended up being false. Instead of all the great happy hour specials, it was $3 domestic bottles....who gives a $HIT. Anyways, we are staying at the Palazzo but recommend going to the Sushi place in the same building; the bartender there was awesome, the drinks were great and the food was delicious.Got very sick!! Don't eat here!!I have no idea why the photo to this Wal Mart displays "SUPERCENTER". This has got to be the tiniest Wal Mart known to man! The parking lot was designed terribly! They rarely have what I want stocked on the shelves. Terrible customer service-sometimes the cashiers ask if I found everything alright. DO NOT go here during the day! Besides battling for a parking spot you will also find yourself waiting in line FOREVER! They do not utilize back up cashiers whatsoever! Why is this the only Wal Mart in Tempe besides the even tinier college location!??! I now drive to Mesa Riverview Wal Mart for all my Wal Mart needs. If you're reading this, I suggest you do the same.IT'S CLOSED! no longer in business.I used to work in this hell hole and I just recently heard that like 12 people dropped like flies and either quit or got fired . The management here is so corrupt it's funny. Last time I was there the main supervisors were high and drunk, well their always high . Not naming any names . Lol ! I heard one moved up in MGM to a different position ? Why MGM ? He's always faded as hell at work. I hope the MGM reads this !  Enough about working there, this place never updates their crimes scenes or fixes any parts of the broken exhibit . They don't care about the guests . They just want your money . Managers sit there on their phones and talk sh@$ about guests . So glad I quit. Wouldn't waste my money here ! :)Arrived at the hotel two days ago at 8 PM after pre-paying for a room. Man at the front desk tells me there are no rooms ready. He calls his supervisor on the radio, and I can hear his supervisor say that there will be a room ready in five minutes, but not to give it to me. Instead, he wants me to wait 45 minutes for a different room. when I said that was not acceptable, he said, "what's your problem?" 
  I spoke with the supervisor, who had a horrible attitude and acted as though I was completely unreasonable for expecting my room to be ready five hours after the check-in time. He said, "can't you see we're having problems?"  The strange thing is that they've had problems several weeks in a row now.  If the staff at this hotel cannot have their rooms ready in time for the guests who have made a reservation, they are not competent.  I think they make people wait for rooms just so they will go lose money in the casino.  What a lousy thing to do when all I wanted was to check in and go to bed.  I am disappointed that this hotel is so mismanaged that they purposefully overbook their rooms so that I cannot get a room even though I've made a reservation.  They gave me a room that was worse than what I requested instead of offering me an upgrade or even a coupon for a hamburger.  I'm disappointed that the management would hire a front desk supervisor with such terrible customer service skills.  I'm disappointed that the management in this building thinks it's okay that I walked away from the front desk absolutely furious.The Cashier Lady of "L'EPID'OR Bakery", is so TERRIBLE!! What is wrong with her? Probably she's never gotten customer service training. Of course no smile whenever I saw her, NEVER says "hello" nor "thank you".
Yesterday (July 19th, around noon) was the worst. She was tapping her fingers so hard after the check out (when I was putting my change to my wallet). It was so ANNOYED!! I looked at her, she stopped tapping, but 2 seconds later, she started again. Then, I looked at her again, she stopped. Then I turned and leaving, she started tapping so hard again!! I don't have a chance to put my change to my wallet for a little moment?!? Or she was not happy because I asked her to give me a receipt? By the way, the store was so slow, no customers but me.
My friends, who went to the bakery, hate her so bad, too. One of them has never go back to Greenland Supermarket because she doesn't want to see her face. Too bad the bakery is located at the entrance of the building.
The Bakery Cashier Lady should know what is a customer service, she should not have a job at a check out counter.It was my first time step into a jewelry buyer store, and it was pretty bad experience. 

First of all, I have to say that I have no experience in the jewelry trade before, so I didn't know about the price difference in the market price and the price that a gold buyer can offer. 

So, I was a little surprised when hearing that my 800 dollar ruby ring only worth $75 dollar for trade... and also several other pieces of jewelries...very surprisingly low price that young guy in the store evaluated. Ok, these are fine... but what angered me is that:

The young guy was not respecting and impatient with my items: he kind of thought they are "cheap", so when he weighted the jewelry, he almost "threw" the bracelet and ring onto the plate!!! I was really nervous when hearing the jewelry dropped onto the metal plate. My bracelet was very delicate made, with gold. 

Second, when the first time he evaluated my ruby ring, he said it was lab made... Hey, The little cloud in the stone can be seen even with my naked eye! Then he came to the back of the store and asked a jewelry-smith to see the ring, and the jewelry-smith said it is nature.... well, he didn't apologize to me for that. So imagine, if he didn't ask the other, and wrongly evaluated the jewelry, what kind of result it would be like? 

I don't know who the person "Jim" is, that appeared in many posts here. But I can just say I am very uncomfortable with the young man.  

Yes, I am a foreigner, from Shanghai, China. I have been to many other states in the US, and many countries in the world, but have never be treated like that!

I need an apology from the store.

ps: I just read one of the filtered review for this store, from an Asian girl, she also had a bad experience in the store...well, maybe the owner just don't like Asians.Never impressed, no matter how many 'second chances' we give it. So we simply stopped visiting this establishment. Too many horror stories to even begin to tell detailsJust another place trying to make money just off the name.. Let's just say.. I would not go back to this location... After eating at the one in LA... I don't even know how they can even call themselves Pinks... They should just call themselves - Just another hot dog place.   Very disappointed and I got a stomach ache after eating a chili dog...Couldn't wait to try this place. My friends love it. Me on the other hand could careless for the overpriced hot dogs. I had the Mojave Dog. It was alright definitely not worth the $. The chili cheese fries were better than the Dog but that's not good enough for me to go back. I'm giving it 1 star because the employees are very nice!Worst five guys experience ever. Dude cooking fries made them so greasy we couldn't eat them. And he was dripping w sweat as he handed us our food.  Usually love five guys but this location needs help.I was looking for a 5S in any carrier because I wanted to pay full price. 

When I walked in at 12:15pm, the greeter was very rude and annoying. I knew what I wanted. He asked me with an attitude "you buying a phone and you don't know which carrier you want?" Then I patiently told him I wanted either Verizon or Tmobile because they're unlocked to all carriers. He said there were Silver and Space gray 5S for Tmobile avaiable. Then he walked me to the manager. 

The manager was even ruder and unknowledgeable. Everyone knows Verizon 5S is factory unlocked but she kept insisting it's locked to Verizon only. Then she told me to wait while she double-checking. She never got back to me at all and kept me waiting for so long. After a while until I couldn't wait any longer, I asked if anyone was coming to assist me then they sent a man to assist me after a few more minutes.

 The man who assisted me asked me to wait again so he could check if they had stock available. Then he came back and told me there were no 5S left. 

People at this store had to be kidding me. They're not only unknowledgeable but also very rude. They keep wasting my time for nothing. I never write reviews but this time I have to. 

I've been to Chandler, Biltmore, Scottsdale Apple stores but never experienced this joke before. 

Apple needs to do something with the staff at this store or else you'll being losing more Apple fans like me. This store doesn't even worth 1 star.My sis and I ordered a specialty Long Island and had to send it back since there was a lingering chemical-like taste after each drink.  We sent it back and got two regular Long Islands that had the same problem. We still felt I'll the next day.  Also, the butternut ravioli was served lukewarm and the chicken on the chicken Caesar salad was dry.  Very disappointing all the way around.Beware: not for those that aren't rich.  After being a patient for 10 years I've been tossed aside time and time again as someone who they can't make an extra buck off.  Getting dr May to do anything without paying him is impossible (want to just ask him a question on the phone? Not without a copay first). It's obvious where their priorities are and it's not helping the patient to their full extent. VERY disappointed and will advise everyone in the future to never waste their time and instead goto a doctor that started medicine to HELP people and not make money off of rich suburbanites.Normally I'm really happy with this Fedex location. I had a HORRIBLE experience here this morning with the Assistant Manager, who provided a textbook example of enforcing policy without purpose.

Unhappy.I used to really like this place but the last time I was there, I got exposed to some sort of nail fungus. They've gotten lazy with sanitation.  My favorite technician, Rose, is also gone, but the good news is she relocated to Kim's nails.....just down the street near Copps.  Much cleaner salon and Rose did a great job on my nails.Mexican food is  my favorite cuisine. I acquired this nom preference after living in Chicago and visiting California for many years. 
Since moving to Wisconsin, I have had a hard time finding food that is satisfying. I work in Cross plains and have passed La Tolteca many times.

Today I was interested in a burrito. Simple enough, si?

 No. I ordered a bean burrito with Jalapeño Fresco y Aquate. I was presented with a large tortilla filled with lettuce, slightly burned beans, cheese, and aging avocado. The tortilla was slightly folded over on each side making a tube like structure. 
There was no way to pick the burrito up without slop seeping out. I had to use a fork and knife. :-(

I must say that receiving fresh jalapeños when ordered was amazing!  (this is usually very difficult) But this was not what I had in mind. I want to satisfy my hunger with a large bean burrito packed full of veggies that I can pick up with my hands. 

One last mention: The table we were seated at was pretty dirty. 

Where can I find amazing mexican food?I live right by Amore so when they opened up I decided to give them a try.  The first time we ordered from Amore we got a pizza.  It was mediocre.  What really struck me was the service.  The young man at the register was outside talking to his friends and texting when I got there.  It took him at least two minutes to come back inside and help me and when he finally did he was rude!

The second time I went in I ordered pizza and wings.  When I got there once again I had to wait for the person working the register to stop chatting on his phone to serve me.  My pizza was ready but they hadn't even started my wings.  I sat and watched them make my wings.  I almost told them to just forget it because they wings looked horrible.  They were pale and they used an already used bowl to coat them in buffalo sauce.  I literally live 2 minutes and when I got home my pizza was cold, I was also concerned the wings were undercooked so I cut one open first to check.  I was right!  They were completely raw on the inside.  I had to put them in the oven for at least another 30 minutes and they were still so greasy and terrible I ended up picking off all the chicken meat and feeding it to the dogs!

I must be a glutton for punishment because I tried them a third time and once again had a terrible experience.  I didn't have to wait at the register and this time the cashier was actually friendly.  My husband and I ordered a pizza, salad, and garlic bread.  When I got home I realized I had never gotten the salad.  I was back there less than 10 minutes of leaving and I told him he had forgotten to give me my salad.  He basically accused me of trying to get a free salad off of him!  He tried to tell me I had never ordered a salad.......At first I thought he was kidding but then I realized he was serious!  We had ordered online so I told him just to check their online order log.  He told me that wasn't possible.  Then I told him to just look at my receipt!  It should be at the top of their garbage can since I watched him throw it away.  He glanced in the garbage bin and told me it wasn't there.  I had my credit card receipt and I showed it to him.  I asked him how it could possibly be that much if I hadn't ordered a pizza bread and salad since the salad was $8.  I had to sit there arguing with him for almost 10 minutes before he'd give me my salad.  

If you want to avoid bad food and TERRIBLE service then avoid this place at all costs!!

If you're in the area and really have a pizza craving go to Bashas!  They sell whole pizzas and pizza by the slice and it's actually very good and you'll receive five star+ service.As a treat for a friend and I having a hard time, I booked appointments for couture pedicures together, which was the highest service you could get.. a spa pedicure basically. The place itself is cute and clean- they had us in a small room together which was great. 

First though... these are just benches with pillows, not pedicure chairs. That was not the BFD. The BFD was that although we'd made appointments, showed up at time and paid for the highest service, the guy doing my pedicure raced through the crappiest pedicure ever. My friend got there 10 minutes before me, I somehow was finished 10 minutes earlier than she was.  Her pedicurist, a woman, was just lovely and sweet and the guy I had couldn't have put in less effort if he tried. There was no massage, he literally just put lotion on me and called it a day. He didn't do any scrubbing of callous.... There's a part of the massage where they wrap your feet in hot towels, which sounds lovely, but these actually hurt, and I've got a pretty decent pain threshold. I mentioned it to him immediately (as in, Holy Christ, that's too hot!). The other pedicurist actually said, "I wait a minute so they cool off".  Guy didn't wrap toes to separate nails, so they were all screwed up by the time I left. Most things were notable only because we were getting side by side pedicures, so it stood to reason they'd be the same. They were not, which made it laughable. 

By the end of the pedicure we were openly commenting in a polite way, "hey, don't let me rush you" (which he took literally.... he was busy sweeping the floor while my friend's pedicure was being finished.)

To be fair, I didn't bother tipping him I was so annoyed. And to top it all off... you have to pay $1 surcharge to use a credit card. Don't get me wrong, its a buck. but its insulting. 

Wouldn't go near them again and writing this out actually annoyed me again so much i'm calling them tomorrow to say something.ClosedGreat place for a late night drink but otherwise it completely blows!!  The service sucks and when we asked the waitress what do you have that's Italian she said well not much.....won't be coming back here again!!!!  Linguine and clams came in the shells?!!  Really?!  Bring on the Artisan!!I was very excited about going to Tom Ford. I was looking to get a couple suits. It was one of my main objectives on this trip. But from the minute i walked in I was disappointed. The customer service I received was by far the worst from any of the boutiques in Vegas(almost outlet level service). I was on vaca middle of the day in Vegas so I was not dressed the part when I walked in, so I was immediately dismissed. You would think they understand people are on Vacation and dressed at such during the day. I basically had to beg for help. After a few minutes of awkwardness. I just walked out. Very disappointed.Me and several of my girlfriends went here for a bachelorette party. We had a table reserved with two bottles and were put outside on the coldest day in Vegas with the wind as cold as can be. We tried tipping the guy a hundred bucks to get us inside but they said all the tables reserved had more bottles than us and were all full so they couldn't do it. So being pretty desperate and freezing we found a table full of guys, coincidentally there for a bachelor party, and asked if we could put our bottles on their table and join them. They kindly accepted and next thing you know, the vanity people get upset at us and say we can't do that. They made it damn near impossible for us to have a good time. We had to scatter about for them to give us a break. Other than this incident the club was ok and the bathroom  was really pretty.I stayed Aria more than three times. Love their service, restaurants, casino and such but City Bar... It was the worst service experience I've ever had. 

My SO and I went there after midnight. It was empty except a group of loud college guys sitting in the corner. The waitress walked passed us several times and wouldn't take our order. A sleazy fat guy with four call girls came in - the waitress was being friendly and attentive. She led them to the couch and took their orders. Uhhhhh, really??! We tried to get her attention and she intentionally ignored us again. The bouncer actually told us to leave without telling us why.

We weren't being rude or anything. Just simply trying to get their attention. ;pThis review is subject to change as I have not actually received my order yet.

I dropped off a sweatshirt with Think to do a very simple one sided print. I was told that the sweatshirt would be ready by the following wednesday, thursday at the latest. Doubly assured it would be done by christmas which was the whole point. 

Well wednesday rolled around and they said it would be ready friday. I was already surprised that it was going to take them a week to do a one off, one sided print, but I'm an amicable customer in general and I didn't hassle them about it. I called them on Friday and after many times trying to reach them, I had to ride my bike over to their location only for them to tell me their phone had been silenced... and that my shirt was at another location, but to rest assured it would be there by 3:30. Very disappointing, but not nearly as disappointing as what followed.

After several correspondence and a second trip back to the store at 3:30 my shirt still was not there. They told me that they were behind on their orders and that they would be staying late to catch up, this would be admirable if it didn't turn out that not only was no one on their way to bring me my order, but it had never even been started in the first place. I find it incredibly hard to believe that NO ONE  on the staff was aware of this during the entire week. The person I spoke to was very apologetic and PROMISED me that he would come in on saturday to get the shirt done, and would call me when it was ready. Now I'm in Northern California a week later with no jacket.

So now I am forced to write this review and share my experience with yelp. I see you guys respond to your bad reviews so here's what I have to say in summary:

1. Be attentive. It helps to actually know where your merchandise is located
2. Be honest. I was misled and brushed off by their entire staff. THE ENTIRE STAFF
3. Acquire the capacity to do your own printing. You're a shop that puts graphics on T-shirts, you should probably be able to do a one off in your own shop.

Perhaps I will be blown away when I get my shirt back and it will all be worth it. I would be willing to re-evaluate this review if that is the case. I will be coming back New Years Eve, and look forward to seeing if the quality of their product matches the quality of their service. I am much more curious though at how they are planning on making this up to me.Great-tasting food that caused both my wife and I to get sick later. Horrible waitress and manager. We won't be going back... ever!Had only been in coopers for drinks which are awesome! Bartenders are friendly and offer a great selection of beer. Last time we were in here we were intrigued by the menu and made plans to come in and try the selections.

We went in last night around 9:00 for dinner. Started out with the pretzel appetizer. The pretzel was great however the Beer-Cheese sauce they served it with was lacking salt and balance. The sauce was extremely thin like it had sat in a heating well all day and broke down. 

Next we tried a bowl of their French Onion soup with gruyere and a side of mixed greens. We were a little confused why you would use fat tire from out of state when after all this is Wisconsin and we have tons of our very own local brews that fit. The soup came and we could smell that something had been scorched. Regardless we broke through the broiled cheese and dug in. It had good flavor but it finished with a bitter scorched taste...the same one we could smell. Little disappointing because Onions are cheap and every chef knows a good French Onion starts low and slow to get the perfect caramelization. The side salad was just spring mix with maybe a few drops of oil. 
Along with the soup we ordered a Veggie Platter. Not what we expected. It was 2 different types of hummus, along with 3 different pickled items. The beet hummus was what caught my eye first. Great taste but it looked like thickened Pepto on a plate...or something that comes out of Barneys mouth when he sneezes. The rest of the plate was average with Pickled Green beans, Pickled cabbage, frozen pita that was gently warmed and pickles. Not bad.

We each ordered an Entree. The beef stew with dumplings and pretzel crusted chicken. The Stew was the farthest from the description you could imagine. It was on a bed of spätzle that had been cooked long before served. The stew was tomato based with brussel sprouts and 2 small cubes of beef. Looked and tasted like it had sat in a heating well all day and reduced to a tomato paste with what resembled to once be chunks of vegetables that had been long past braised. Took one bite each and there we sat broken hearted.

Next the Pretzel Crusted Chicken with butternut squash hash and a whole grain mustard sauce. The hash was just diced butternut squash with no care to show knife skills and you guessed it....those damn brussel sprouts again. There was no salt or depth to the hash and I don't know what would classify it as a hash. The brussel sprouts were overcooked and brought back in a saute pan with oil and the squash.
The chicken was dipped in an egg wash and dredged with pieces of pretzel and panko. Then, sadly, it was deep fried. It was a good sized breast and it was moist, but way over- salted. The whole grain cream sauce was good and a good pair. The execution on the whole dish was lacking however.

The menu reminded me of bits and pieces of a few restaurants around town where I had seen these dishes before: Unami, Cadillac Ranch a.k.a Texas Tubbs West (RIP) and Brocach. The menu was intriguing and caught my eye but it had too many directions and was all over the board from Mediterranean to new American to Scottish. 


Cheers!!

P.S.- Our server was great!! However when the FOH manager was addressed with the problems we had she begrudgingly comp'd the entrees and soup; then put her coat on and left for the night. 

Don't worry we won't be returning.Entire rental experience was a complete disaster. Rent somewhere else.We decided to give this local pizza joint a chance since it's really the only one in my neighborhood. Typically I order my pizza from Costco because of the quality of ingredients, size and value. 

I decided on two pizzas.....one sausage and mushroom which the girl on the phone said the sausage was made fresh everyday in house and one cheese pizza. We also thought we would give their wings a try since Costco doesn't offer wings in their food court.

We were very disappointed and will probably not return. First, the pizza was very expensive for what you get. The pizza is in this strange oval shape and the crust was burnt in many locations. The crust is very thin and I couldn't get the burnt taste out of my mouth to enjoy the other ingredients.

The wings....meh, I've experience better. These guys were smaller than the average wing and I felt they were very fatty. 

I was really hoping that Rochelli's would be a hit because I would much rather support a local/family restaurant that buying from a warehouse that I can find in every major city. I have lived in the area for about 5 years and this location has been 3 or 4 different pizza restaurants.....I hope the writing isn't on the wall and the restaurant gets their act together.I do not even think this is a real shop! My boyfriend purchased a Betty Page dress for me as a surprise for a wedding we were going to about a month and half early! He finally told me when it never came. I asked him to pull up the tracking info. There was no tracking info I do not even think there was a confirmation number, just to be expecting the shipment in 3-5 days. He called, I called. NO ANSWER. Left multiple voice mails and emails. He finally had to contact his back to get his money back!

This was back in August 2011. I just came across their website again today and wanted to share! 

DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!No joke, easily the worst Jack In The Box in the state. Dirty tables, rude employees, bad food.They are closed, out of businessI came here with my daughter on May 7th 2014 and then again on May 21st 2014. On the 21st, I was waiting for my daughter to be finished with her nail drying and as I was waiting, I noticed their inspection review posted on the wall. I began reading it and every technician was red flagged. Every single one. The inspector had so much to write about he/she wrote all the faults and flags in between preprinted words, around the outsides of the page, and on the back. For each tech under the comment field, he/she had to write so small about all their short-comings that it was very difficult to read. From what I gathered, it was mostly how each tech wasnt cleaning their tools properly, unsanitary, bacteria found.  The date for the inspection was May 8th 2014. The one line that stuck with me was "not a single bottle of disinfectant/tsa or liners throughout the entire salon nor at any nail stations". When I was finished reading, I turned around and found that management the receptionist and a few other techs were watching me. I asked when their next inspection will be, and they said "no need, we passed". I said, "according to this, clearly not". I got a shrug of the shoulder and a back to my face. When I paid, I didnt offer a tip, and the receptionist asked me if I was going too, I informed her that I shouldnt be paying for anything,  but because I didnt come in here to get something for free nor an infection or worse HEP C, I certainly wont be giving a tip. Needless to say, I wont be going back. IMHO.I was so disappointed in my shopping experience this last weekend, or should I say my LACK of shopping experience.  My husband and I were in the market for two main purchases, track lighting and carpet.  We spent at least 15 minutes in the track lighting section and needed some help, but never saw any employees.  We then went over to the carpet section.  We were looking to replace our carpet in the living room and we were ready to make a decision.  We spent approximately 30 minutes in this area and even had a carpet picked out that we really like, but again we never saw any employees in this area either.  I heard other customer complaining as well.  Finally we abandon the few items we'd pick out to purchase and drove over to Home Depot.  They were awesome and ended up getting our business.Worst service ever!  11 minutes to get my order inside with only 2 people in  front of me.  They pay attention to the drive through only, and that too looks slow. Dont go here!  They are rude too!I admit to being a victim of the Groupon scam!  I can only imagine how many times this office has succeeded in duping customers since my experience with them was exactly the same as others I've read online.  The hygienist will recommend the so-called deep cleaning.  You will be given an estimate of what they would charge you, but since you don't have insurance, you'll get a discounted price.  If you balk at this newly discounted price and threaten to leave, you will be given another discount.  But wait, there's more.  When you go ahead with the procedure, because, golly, it would go against their standards to do the regular cleaning you've bought and paid for, you will get ANOTHER price when it's time to pay!  Please check this price as it will include, "hygienist Instruction", which is the for the time and effort she spent talking you into the outrageously expensive deep cleaning.  I'm guessing this $59 is her bonus as it was taken off my bill when I asked what exactly did "hygienist instruction" entail.  (the answer was, "I guess it was her instruction to you")
I hope to save others the bother of trying to use this Groupon or any other deal this office issues.  They want you in the chair to sell you unnecessary services at an inflated rate.  (I say unnecessary because I used this Groupon offer to check out a new dental office.  I have a regular dentist to whom I will be returning, who never proposed the amount of work this office proposed!)Money grubbing Dentist - wanted almost $2000 to do a deep cleaning on my fiancee's teeth and charged almost $400 for some filling replacements with my insurance before they would give me the promotional "free" teeth whitening. After finally getting this whitening stuff it was a little syringe of bleach and a plastic tray like you can get at the store for $10. That was just the beginning! The filings HURT! A LOT! So did retainer he have me that was supposed to be invisalign. I went back multiple times to have him adjust both to be told that I needed to buy $11 numbing toothpaste. Teeth still hurt! Then when I changed dentists, they called me to try to collect a $25 fee. Screw that. I'd rather get new x rays than pay you again for the ones I already paid for!I was sent to Tobler Physical Therapy by my neurologist's PA for rotator cuffs and neck.  I first had to check in with the front desk as they had already gotten my insurance information over the phone from me and called my insurance for my benefits.  When I went up to the front desk, they told me that I had already met my deductible and that my payments would be 18.00 each visit. The first visit went pretty well, Lee evaluated me so that I could be put on a program.  The second visit was different.  The women therapists like to chat a lot.  They seem to be more involved in what each of them had done over the weekend than what was going on with the patient.  Even though a routine had been planned for me, they rarely followed it.  I would stand around in between exercises waiting for them to finish their conversations.  They acted like I should know everything and on what setting I should do every exercise after just the first visit.  They NEVER watched me do my exercises to make sure that I was doing them right.  I would have to tell them that it hurts and I can't do this.  This happened each and every week, 2 times a week.  One day they heard that the owner was coming.  Boy did they get busy then.  Lee decided that I wasn't making much progress and recommended that I allow him to adjust my neck.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  I told him that Dr. Fitzpatrick, the first neurologist that evaluated me, told me that I was never to have another adjustment of any kind because of the 5 deteriorated discs in my neck, C3, C4, C5, C6 and C7 as it could be very dangerous.  I brought my MRI for Lee to see.  I didn't feel that they took me very seriously, I guess they think they know better than Barrows.  I paid my 18.00 each visit thinking each time that it wasn't even worth that.  I stopped going after 11 visits.  Then I received a phone call from their billing department in Georgia?? telling me that my insurance did not pay as I had NOT met my deductible yet.  What???  They told me that I now owe over 600.00!!  Not for this unprofessional service!  18.00 was too much!  I have since had surgery on my right rotator cuff for torn rotator cuff, bicep tendon torn 90%, torn sub scapula tendon and two others that were torn.  I have every color twine, 2 titanium anchors and 2 plastic anchors in my shoulder.  My left shoulder is just as bad and I am scheduled for surgery on June 28th.  I guess that if they were watching me do my exercises, they have noticed!!!  After my surgery I went to Dynamic Rehab off of Higley Rd by Banner Hospital.  They are absolutely great!!  They are professional and they WATCH me!  They can tell when I am not carrying myself right and where the problem is.  Again they observe and help!  I cannot stress enough the unprofessionalism of Tobler Physical Therapy and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.  What a joke!  I told my neurologist Dr. Yeung and he said he wouldn't pay either.  If you want a good physical rehab, DON'T go here, you will be worse when they get done with you than you were when you went in like I was.They Horrible Service And Hospitality,  I Was Charged and Never Got Any Pictures Nor DVD. Because of the baby's position, and in order to reschedule I have to pay again, so I will be reporting them to the better business bureauI can't even give this business a 1 star even if I was feeling extra nice, but yelp forces you to at least give a one star so Rosati's on Power and Thomas can thank yelp for that one star. I am from the Chicago area and this place wouldn't survive a day in Chicago with the horrible food and customer service. I don't know who owns this business, but they should be ashamed of the people that represent them. Our order was screwed up once before and this time I drove 15 minutes from my own home to find that nothing changed. I asked for BAKED mostaccioli. I get there and all that was there was meat sauce and noodles and there is supposed to be cheese and when I ordered I even asked for the cheese to be well done and if she hadn't been in such a rush to take my order and talk over me she might have actually heard what I said. This is what happens when you hire children to run your business. The same girl who screwed up my order the first time did it again on 1/8/13. Then when I walk back into the place the manager who looks and acts like he is all of twelve years old says are you here to pick upand I told him what happened, what I actually ordered and that I wanted my money back and he cancels my transaction and to this date the money still hasn't been returned to my account. He never offered to fix the situation or do anything to try and at least make it somewhat better. I would never tell anyone to go to this establishment ever!!!! By the way the lasagna my daughter had was disgusting too and that was the only thing that wasn't screwed up!!!Went to the parts department to get a seal for my Dodge 4x4. It was Saturday around 1:00 on 02/08/14. There was only one middle aged guy behind the counter. He brings out the part and says that will be 32.80 plus tax. I gave him the money and asked, isn't it 17 something on your web site? He said, well everything is cheaper online and gave me my receipt and walked off. What an ass. Returned the part and will never do that again. 

Also, it is a little obvious that the positive reviews are from the sales peoples' friends. When they use their first and last name and write it like a mini commercial.I LOVE the idea of this place!  It is a very colorful interesting place.  The people that run it are poor business people and jerks.  

The website should be your first clue.  When you read about how they cannot accommodate people with gmail - run.  Then the way you register is almost archaic in this day and age - send an email???

After my free introductory class for my child where I felt absolutely unwanted - parents are NOT allowed to watch (WHAT??? How do I know what my child is learning so I can reinforce that in the kitchen at home???), the instructor was in a pissy mood (she actually said something to the effect of "if you older kids feel like this is too slow for you we have better classes, there are younger kids in here and I don't know why).  I sent an email to Chef Kathy to give her my feedback.  She defended everything that happened during our "introductory" class.  If I didn't believe in the value of teaching kids to cook then I would NEVER return.  And this is the class that is supposed to be the hook to get you to buy a membership???

Additionally, she uses groupon a lot.  The last groupon in april sold 2,111 spaces in the class.  It seems like they only have about  2 - 3 classes per day with about 10 students each.  That's only about 30 spaces per day, plus they have to accommodate their membership students.  So here it is the beginning of June and all of June's classes are still sold out.  Most of July's classes are sold out.  How are you ever supposed to get a space in this place at this rate???  Not to mention they are only getting about $5 for each of these students due to the price of the groupon so I wonder how much longer they can pay the bills.

I think someone who actually enjoys teaching children, cooking, believes in good customer service and has a GOOD business sense should open their own YCA.  After all, it is a franchise and I would definitely go there and leave this one in the dust.

I would also stay away from Chef Jo, I think she hates kids.Very disappointed!  Last 2 times I've been I was very unhappy. A while ago, we did the drive through and the  fried chicken was falling apart and bones inside were broken.  Almost like it was smacked around on the counter.  This last time, we had the grilled, and most of it was very dry andI thought they did a good job until I went to Foothills Sports Medicine.  I started getting a weird feeling when I kept getting calls to make visits when I didn't even need treatment anymore.  I went there again for a non injury but a soreness and somewhat trauma I've had for a while.  When I stopped going, I got calls again to come in.  My insurance isn't great and they knew that.  The worst part is the their billing, it's confusing and they don't even understand it.I come here because it's the closest spot to my house. The staff is awful, but the men who work there are much easier to deal with than the women. ANY TIME I have dealt with a female, I've walked out without finishing what I came to do. They are so unhelpful and RUDE! 

I walked in to pay a bill and only had $100.00 bill on me. Th lady who greeted me tried to send me to the kiosks and I told her, no I want to talk to a HUMAN. Then she said "I don't have change, but you can go to chili's and get change" at that point she was lucky I didn't slap her. Basically she was tellin me NO ONE paid with cash that day? I call bullshit. Had she been nicer I wouldn't be yelping my horrible experience but she got all snarky the minute I didn't want to use to kiosks. I guess doing a job you get paid to is too hard to manage. I didn't get her name but I will be getting it!

You would think that since Verizon is the most expensive service, they would have better representatives, but they have like the worst customer service which is just not worth renewing my contract for.HUGE COCKROACH IN BATHROOM OF OUR ROOM!!!! 
Let me begin by saying how excited my husband and I were for this trip, and especially to stay at The Cosmopolitan - the newest, hottest hotel on the strip. We've stayed at 5 different other 5 star hotels so far in previous visits, but were sure this one looked even better. We've had this trip planned for over a year and met friends out there whom we hadn't seen for just as long. We arrived Thursday night, and were immediately blown away by the lobby. We looked at each other as we stood in line to to check-in, "Oh yes, this has got to be the nicest hotel built in Vegas yet." Excitedly we went up to our room in the East tower. I found it cute when the woman who checked us in said, "I put you guys in the East tower because it looks like you want to have fun." We rode up to the 22nd floor - headed to room 2288. The 1 bedroom suite was seemingly a dream suite for a 4 night stay in Vegas! Spacious with a jacuzzi overlooking our balcony, and a good sized kitchen area! I took pictures and proudly showed off where we were staying on facebook right away - with the caption "By far the best rooms in Vegas to stay in - better than Encore even!" We quickly unpacked all of our things into the drawers of the bathroom, and hung all of our nice clothing. We had already grabbed drinks and snacks from Walgreens across the street, so our little mini fridge was set to go as well. We were settled in nicely, waiting for our friends to arrive from across the country. Now is where the tables turned fast about this place. I opened the door to the toilet (small room that is sectioned off from the bathroom), and had already started to crouch and sit my behind down when there it was - fast and bright copper, about the size of the width of a credit card, was a COCKROACH - right on top of the toilet, crawling on the spare roll that the hotel has wrapped in blue silk. I've never jumped and screamed so fast in my life out of that room, straight onto the couch where my hands met my face in immediate tears. My husband looked at me in horror asking what happened. I told him in panic as I checked my skin over and over for creepy crawlers. He went and checked, (admitted to not believing me when I first said it to him), and came out smiling , "Wow you're right. And he's a big boy too." The first thing he did was get a good picture of it too. I screamed at him in more tears, "It's not funny!! Grab all of our stuff right now! We need to leave!"He told me to calm down and call the front desk. I did just that, and a woman answered. I hurriedly told her what we just found in our room, and her immediate calm response was, "Oh alright, would you like me to put in an order to maintenance, to have someone come up there and get it for you?" !!!!! "Excuse me?!! Get a maintenance guy is your response to this?! YES! & while we pack all of our stuff up, we cannot stay here! What can you do about this ma'am? I am horrified!" in more tears. "I'm sorry but we're fully booked, it's a holiday weekend." I immediately demanded a manager, knowing I'm bound to get some sort of immediate solution and/or relief from whoever was to pick up the phone next. As a business owner myself, and manager, I would be furious with an employee who took such a coy approach to the disaster unfolding. Jeff, the night manager gets on the phone. I quickly get him up to speed, although I soon realize he was already prepared with what he said next. It was at least 3 minutes before I was put through to him, which felt like an eternity as I'm standing there, scratching my legs, arms and my eyes are scanning every inch of the room. He immediately takes the "friend" approach with me and asks if it's ok to call me by my first name. "Rochelle, what would you like us to do about it? Don't worry, she already put in the order for it to be removed from your room. I don't know how long it will be though, we are very busy. I realize this is an unpleasant thing to find in your room, but I really can't move you anywhere else. We're booked solid, I'm sorry." In horror, and almost a squeal I said "JEFF, maybe you didn't hear me correctly, but I FOUND A MASSIVE COCKROACH in my room that I paid a lot of money for!! This is a 5 star hotel that I booked based off of great reviews and reputation. This is not OK, and whether there is an infestation of roaches on this floor or just one, its enough to make my skin crawl and feel absolutely filthy and paranoid obviously. I cannot stay here, especially not in this room or floor for that matter. Put yourself in my shoes! " Manager Jeff continues, "I understand they're not a fun bug to look at, but I can assure you the whole time I've worked here no ones found one. They're like the moths that fly in guests' rooms sometimes, sometimes they're there. Nothing you can do but get used to the idea that you might find one from time to time. Hey Rochelle, I'm from Florida - they are everywhere there and it's the norm. He Chuckled.After seven months of e-mails and proof of a rip-off, management decided to do nothing. While in Vegas last September, three of us decided to park at the hotel's bar from 10:00 to 1:00 AM. The next day, my business partner had indicated that he had cover the bar bill for $200.00, he left at 12:00 midnight. In looking in my wallet, I too had basically the same bar bill, but showed my bill being paid at 1:00 AM. We all had different drinks, rum and coke, double rum and coke, and margarita. To show the management, that I agree the first bill. However, my bill had the same drinks plus, the few drinks we added from midnight to 1:00. Bill should have been $250.00 total. Not $400!
As a result of this "SCAM" I am giving the hotel bar 1! Even though it could have been an oversight on the bar tender and the waitress,accounting decided to ignor my many request!Car was dirty, desk person told me I was not a U.S. Citizen and therefore could not rent a car, regardless of the fact that I had not only rented from them a year ago and the fact that I had my DL out in front of him.  Took 15 minutes of arguing with this idiot before a co-worker (whom had been listening and not busy, but obviously ignoring the situation) came over and showed this guy how to work his mouse!  Literally the guy could not use the computer.  Then when I tried to return the car the people who worked the washers could not tell me where the booth person was...even though I had been waiting for 30 minutes.  They just kept telling me to wait "over there" and they all pointed in different directions.  I finally had to go inside and get assistance.  The same computer savvy guy was there and told me he could not help me (what a surprise), and to go wait outside again.  I told him I wanted to see a manager immediately and (what a surprise) he came outside all the while acting put-out that he had to leave the job he knows so well.  NEVER AGAIN!

P.S. they will charge unsuspecting renters an airport fee.  THEY ARE NO WHERE NEAR THE AIRPORT and I am a local.  And a shuttle fee as well, even if you did not take the shuttle.Capriottis is good...don't get me wrong but what gets me going back to a place is the staff and the service they give.  
Once in a while I crave the SLAW BEJO and the BOBBIE.  This particular place is nearby my home and makes it convenient to order here and take my goody home to enjoy in front of the telly.
When it first opened, I remember the guy that helped me.....tall, goatee...and I don't know if he has teeth cuz he never smiles.  (lol jk).
I remember now that he was not friendly and I didn't want to go there again.  
Well.....it's been a while and I guess I forgot how sucky the customer service is there.  
Went there again and for the last time.  The same guy was still working there and still no smile...trying to rush me when I was trying to decide what to order.  When he was finished....rang up my stuff...NOT A THANK YOU....I was signing the receipt and he practically yanked it from me cuz I was trying to figure out which receipt to keep and which to give.  I should have said right there and then I wanted my $$$ back.  I should have gotten his name also.  But I will not forget his face that's for sure.  --and I will remember to NOT PATRONIZE this one sandwich shop.  I will take the time to drive somewhere farther for GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE and a smile.  
For those who do not care.....this is the place to go for SUCKY SERVICE.First I get a coupon on my newspaper that says $13.99 for a smog check. I arrived at the location waiting almost 10 minutes for the owner to come over and I handed him the coupon and he says oh for that you must buy car wash. I replied that it does not say that on here, he got extremely rude and said sorry not my problem.  So fine I am there I need it done so I get a car wash that was on special that included an interior & exterior wash. 

They drove my car through a machine available anywhere for like half the price, my wheels were left filthy and they left spots on all the windows. One of the workers stepped into my car to vacuum it and now I have a huge grease stained footprint in the back of my car. I had a to do list & my grocery list on my front seat that they proceeded to throw away!

I will never go back there again, and I will tell everyone I know to stear clear. Their ads are full of false advertisements, they charge extra for everything, and they were rude to me on top of it. This is not how you run a business or treat people!Did a lot of business with this company decided to have an order done somewhere else asked for the artwork that I paid for been getting the runaround for a week now wasn't thrilled with the product that I got originally but the people were nice and planned on doing future business with them based on the hassles and trying to get my own property back from them May have to rethink that

 Will update good or bad.

Finally got my artwork after owner talking all kinds of crap to my partner about me because I'd ask for a price and didn't move forward with an order guys a jerk don't recommend doing business with themWorst service I've ever had. Lupe at the drive-thru has to have THEE worst customer service EVER. She didn't repeat the order, she charged my card, AND got it all wrong. She even felt the need to be rude and have an attitude about it.  Learn some manners and BASIC service skills Lupe.I've never went through Labcorp before. Have always gone through Quest Diagnostics. After driving to 2 different places, I finally ended up here as it was closer to work. 

The 2 ladies in the front did not seem very nice. The black lady only seemed to be nicer towards her kind. The asian lady, I can barely hear what she was saying. She asked for a credit card and didn't explain why. I told her that I dont want anything charged onto this cause it was my debit card not a credit card but she said oh nothing will be charged. After everything was done she said you need to stay here for 2 hours and told me why...I was a bit upset because I wasn't aware the test my dr ordered I had to be there for 2hrs but it wasn't their fault so whatever. She also had me sign something then said, whatever the insurance doesn't pay, it will get charged to your card and I'm like but what if I don't have enough? It's a freakin debit card! And she was like well you should've told me, I already processed it! How can I tell you, if you didn't tell me before hand what was going on?

All in all, the people there I do no like. You have one that talks so low and you can't hear shit. The other one is just rude as hell. I don't think I'll ever come to this location ever again.If i could give 0 stars i would.  I just left here with some coworkers and not one of us was happy with our pizza.  3 of us purchased the thai chicken pizza.  The pizza had so much cilantro you could barely taste anything else.  

To top everything off , when i bit into my second slice of pizza the chicken still had a decent sized bone , STILL IN IT.   To give them credit , they did comp my pizza and did keep the ice tea flowing , but honestly i will never visit this location again.  

Ive had way better "upscale" pizza at CPK ( California Pizza Kitchen)

Ambiance 4\5
Server 3\5
Food 0\5
Cost 0\5.

Ive chewed 2 pieces of gum and still taste cilantro & 
free choking hazard with every purchase act now !I wanted to drop Yelp a line again about Mold Eliminators and how things have recently changed in my opinion.

Shortly after my first yelp review I was contacted by Ben Caine from Mold Eliminators and forgive me I don't exactly remember his title with the company, but my interaction with Ben was professional, articulate and intelligent.

Ben apologized for Bill and Craig's extreme lack of business acumen and was completely willing to speak with me to hear about the problems and stated he wanted to learn from them and better his company.

Ben was a breath of fresh air and all I could ask for. He was genuine in his concern for the clients and equally as genuine in wanting to better the crew to make sure the next client didn't have my experience.

Ben held meetings with his staff and even implemented measures to improve communication between the company and client.

Ben made a horrific experience palatable and even took monetary steps to make things better.

Bravo to Ben, job well done.Horrible, got the most painful fill of my life!! Super glue under nails, sore around cuticlesNever, ever, ever will I come back to this place! The reception on the phone should have warned me. Upon arrival that same person who had answered the phone, Stacey was very standoffish and unwelcoming and borderline rude.  It's kinda dark with a nice display of items for sale but as they saying goes "everything shiny isn't gold" I've never been to a "dog spa" where my poor four-legged baby was so traumatized where she literally ran for the door when I put her down to put her leash on.  Her grooming service was mediocre at best! Her nails weren't filed and her anal glads weren't expressed. She was so exhausted and traumatized that she came home and had a nervous stomach which caused her a bout of diarrhea. Protect you babies. Beware.I purchased an LG Beacon phone from the Siena store in Henderson Nevada on July 8, 2012. I even paid for the "Metroguard insurance" that was an extra $5 per month. Everything was fine in July. In August I had charged my phone as usual and couldn't get the phone to turn on. Took it in the store and they removed the battery and voila the phone worked, Ok. So today a month later same thing happens. Take the phone back to them and tell them this is the second time in two months this has happened. They (Rob) tried to tell me that I had placed the phone near a heat source and thats why it was doing this. Impossible. So I said, "show me on the cover where there is any evidence of that. My phone is charged on a nightstand with nothing that generates heat. They wouldn't do anything to help. I called the warranty dept when I got home and told them what had transpired, and they told me that for $20 they would send me a "refurbished" phone. My phone is two months old, why should I have to settle for a so called refurbished phone? I paid full retail for my phone. There is no more customer service anymore and the sales guy "Rob" was rude and was so quick to try to blame me when this was the second time this happened in two months. BEWARE of this company, even with a warranty it still costs you .I used "You Dirty Dog" for about a year.  While there were some great groomers, the way they ran their business wasn't good.  The way they booked appointments caused the groomers to be consistently late.  The final straw was an appointment where the groomer was 2+ hrs late, groomed only 1 1/2 (don't ask) of my 3 dogs and then the owner never bothered to return numerous emails or phone calls to reschedule.  I was FURIOUS!

I have since moved on to "Doggy a Go Go" and am thrilled with their service and groomers!!  Check 'em out!I went into Body Heat Tanning in mid January to prepare for my cruise on February 2. I explained to the employee that I only wanted to get tan for my cruise, and that I would not need to tan after my cruise. She told me that for one month of tanning it would be $36. I happily purchased the package, and she had me sign an electronic tablet for what she said was "liability release from harm for using the machines" I though nothing of it and signed. My last tanning session was January 30. Well on February 4 I was charged $38.37. I did not notice on my checking account because I was on the cruise. Then on March 2 I was charged another $38.37. I noticed this time. I immediately tried to call, and got no answer. A few days later I called again and was told that what I signed was a month-to-month contract. I explained that I was never told that I was entering into a contract and I asked for a refund. They explained that they could not process a refund, and they would pass my information on to the corporate billing department. a week went by, no call back. I called again and was told that Melissa in billing was not available and she would call me tomorrow. Then I had sinus surgery and was out of it for about a week. I called again on Mar 25 and spoke with Cheyenne. She apologized and promised that Melissa would call me the next day, because Melissa is "the only person in our company that can process refunds". No call the next day. I called and left a voicemail. No call back. I called again today and actually spoke with Melissa, who informed me that she cannot process refunds, which is a contradiction to what Cheyenne told me, but Cheyenne never passed on my information to Melissa, so I guess I shouldn't believe anything she says anyway. Melissa explains to me that "many companies are now using digital signature pads and it is your responsibility to ask for a copy." Granted, I should have asked for a copy of what I was signing. My bad. So now I am waiting to hear back from Melissa who is waiting to hear back from Corporate (if she even sent my info to them) about my refund for $76.74. I will never go back to Body Heat, nor will I ever recommend anyone to them.Came in and asked for a certain shoe in size 6 - 7 1/2. The girl working there today responded "We only have ADULT sizes". I have never been so insulted in my life.If ZERO stars were possible this gym would be getting that from me. My husband went to this gym today with the 14 pass and at the end of his workout inquired about membership. The lady he spoke to was extremely rude. She told him that he should not have come in without checking with someone first ( mind you that the staff does not show up till 9am and he began his workout at 7am). After scolding him for being at the gym she asked him to leave and said that they were very selective in the people whom the allowed to join their gym. I'm not the type to write reviews but obvious racism is a very good reason for me to break a habit. The lady was very condescending. She is Caucasian and my husband is Latino.People, I am kicking myself in the rear for not reading all these negative reviews on Google and Yelp because, if I had, I WOULD OF NEVERRRRRRR brought my car here.
The so-called co-owner needs to go to anger management classes because if you question him on work performed, he turns into a raving lunatic.
I bring my car in for repair all nice and sweet.  I question the work that was done and like a JEKYLL AND HYDE.   
I know they did things on my car that DID NOT NEED to be done because they were just done.  Besides that they totally ripped me off...labor....ridiculous...warranty they give IS A JOKE...Tells me that they never should of let me take withe car with brakes less than 50%...it's a law...I HAVE THE PROOF THAT THEY PUT ON NEW PADS BEFORE I GOT IT.  
RIPPING PEOPLE OFF IS A CRIME.......
SAVE YOUR MONEY....IF THEY TELL YOU SOMETHING IS WRONG, GET ANOTHER OPINION.
YOU WILL BE HAPPY YOU DID.
This place works on foreign cars, ie Mercedes...BMW' etc...They think because people have these cars they can afford to be ripped off...
Well, I am not standing for it.Don't come durning spring training. They don't take reservations and you will wait for bad service and marginal food :-(Note:  This review is location-sensitive.
I called the wrong location (Sun Prairie) when I needed delivery to east Madison. To THEIR credit, the girl there was incredibly nice and gave me the new number of the east side location. 

Rude employee, Bad food, Bad service. Will never order from them again.
However, when I called the Commercial Street location, a gentleman answered, with incredibly loud music in the background causing me to barely understand the questions I expected. He asked for the necessary delivery info and what I wanted. I asked him which would be easier for him, the numbers or titles of what I wanted (given that I looked online prior to calling) and he replied with 'whatever, no both'. I started my order and he corrected me rudely telling me I wasn't referring to the correct numbers, that they belonged to another store (there's only one website). After taking my order, he took my card number, said it would be 45 minutes, and hung up.
The delivery man was very cordial, however, the food was the worst Chinese I've ever had (Order: Crab Rangoon, Chicken Fried Rice, Pork Egg Roll, General Tso's Chicken) - the chicken and rice was dry, the general tso's was mostly fried dough, the crab rangoon had overpowering green onions and the fortune cookie stale.
I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.I'm on the hated-it scale of the Honey Bear love fest.  

We ordered the bbq ribs and a beef sandwich with cole slaw and cowbro beans on the side.  Thought the meal was on the below average scale for tastiness...the beef sandwich meat suffered from not being marinated, and it was bone dry...the bbq rib was more of the same...so this would have been a 2 star review...BUT what pushed it down to 1 star for me was that my ribs were "bloody"...No not pink, but actually bloody with the jelly-like texture of raw meat...great when I'm eating sushi, but not so much for bbq pork

I actually returned the bloody thing to the counter person who agreed that it was bloody and made me a new plate...unfortunately, it was a new plate of the same bloody ribs, I gave up and just trashed the bloody plate....so no, I won't be back for another try

If you're looking for tasty bbq sandwich...try TEXAZ for lunch...that's where I'd be the next time I have a cravingI have no hesitation in giving this review one star.  I wanted a Frosty, but left without anything.  The patron two cars in front of me apparently thought she was ordering at a fine dining establishment.  It's Wendys not a fancy steakhouse. While waiting for this person to finish ordering her lenghtly and detailed order, a bum tried to ask me for change.  I promptly told him to get the F*** out of here.  I took my own advice and did the same.  Will not be back to this location.I've been taking my BMW and Nissan here for about 3 years.  In the past year, business seems to have gone up to the point that they CANNOT MAINTAIN PREVIOUS LEVELS OF GOOD OLD FASHIONED "MOM AND POP" CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Maybe the perfect 5 star rating here has something to do with that, causing business to explode.  However, when this happens a business either expands, or customer service declines.  Precision imports does not seem to desire expansion, and their customer service has become inconsistent and disorganized.  

Trust is vital with your mechanic, and Frank/Al broke trust with me in a few areas.  I trusted them up until the past year.  Earlier this year Al diagnosed my Nissan with a "pinhole oil lead causing oil to pool in the back of my engine, replacement required around $500.  It's a very common problem in this model."  I have not seen any oil leaking from the Nissan, but they assured me "just wait it's going to leak."  

Later this year, the service engine light came on in my BMW.  I trusted that Precision Imports would run appropriate diagnostics.  They did not.  Instead, they insisted that I had "run my car too low on gas, which caused the light to come on" and rebuked me not do let the gas run too low in the future.  (I had not recently let my tank get too low, and it had been low in the past but never caused problems with the service engine light). They got the service engine light off, and charged me $45.  

A few days later, the service engine light came back on.  I thought, ok, the problem must be more serious or a new problem.  I brought my car in.  After several days of waiting, I called to a rude response that they were "extremely busy and just hold on we'll call you when it's ready!"  I let it go, and let a few more days go by.  I called back again, and was returned "It's been ready come and get your car!"  When I pointed out the poor customer service politely, I was returned with "Sorry we've been swamped."

When I came to pick my car up, the reason given as to why the light was on astonished me: "pinhole oil lead causing oil to pool in the back of my engine, replacement required around $500.  It's a very common problem in this model."  SAME SUPPOSED "COMMON" PROBLEM AS MY NISSAN WORD FOR WORD!  AND, they were unable to switch off my service engine light.  I just stared at him.  My read: FULL OF BS.  I said nothing regarding this diagnosis, paid, and left.

I have googled this problem in both cars, and asked around a little.  Neither is a common problem in either car from what I"ve found.  I was even told they have patch kits for the problem, which was never offered to me as an option.

I should add that I also have had 2 "underquotes" on mechanical problems here.  I mean, quoted by phone at one cost, then when I go to pay it was higher.  When I've asked about the higher cost, i feel I was given lines of BS.

WHY DOES A SECOND OPINION MATTER?

The next day I was driving my BMW.  Now call me a jackass for not opening my engine and checking the coolant, but the car was JUST serviced (including oil change, etc) at Precision Imports!  My car started smoking like crazy, and died on busy Bell road.  I was able to get the car into another auto shop.  They found out THE COOLANT WAS EMPTY.  THIS IS WHY THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  The charge was $10.  PROBLEM SOLVED, smooth sailing since.  

I have now taken both cars to 2 different mechanics.  Nothing has been discovered in the area of "pinhole oil leak" on either car.

It used to be that Frank always overstated the price a little, went above and beyond with communication, and took care of me.  He came across as an honest old school guy to me.  It's different now.  Frank's more detached.  I get the feeling Frank is eying retirement, and would prefer working on a much much lower volume of cars.  No comment on the younger guy Al.  Earlier this year when I brought my car in Frank said "make sure you deal with me."  I didn't make much of it, but this could have indicated some other issue going on at the shop.  I did attempt to deal only with Frank this year, but his availability has been very low and he had to route me to Al and others.

I saw a few guys in the shop with a lot of signs pointing to "previously convicted felon."  I'm all about turning it around and 2nd chances, and I realize this can be a staple of many mechanic shops.   But, business is business and I didn't get a good feeling about a few of the newer mechanics in the shop.

I gave them several second chances, and communicated my concerns honestly and appropriately.  But that's it for me.  They lost me as a customer.  I'm hoping that they can turn it around, but for starters they are going to need to lose more customers and reduce the extreme volume or expand to a new location.  

If you're going to use Precision Imports, MAKE SURE THE COST IS DEFINED BEFORE REPAIRS ARE MADE.  ON MAJOR ISSUES GET A SECOND OPINION.Are you serious!!! Stop putting sugar in the gravy!!!! Cali can't do pizza!!!! Nasty!!I recently moved to Phoenix from Las Vegas. I live across from Cheesecake Factory on Camelback Rd. I was hungry one night and stopped in for a quick bite on December 4th. I've always enjoyed their pineapple Mojitos  and the menu variety . I sat at a small table in the bar area. It was literally 5 mins before I was even acknowledged (I timed it)! Then menus were haphazardly dropped on the table. I wasn't offered water and warm bread came out 5 mins later. Meanwhile, the servers were congregating, laughing and joking in the back station, which was clearly visible from my table. I finally ordered a chicken Marsala and that took another 20 mins (I also timed that), to which I jokingly replied to my server (a young, bald AfricanAmerican server with large diamond earrings) "I thought that you forgot about me?" His curt reply was "It's gotta cook!"....I probably won't go back to Cheesecake Factory based on this last visit, even though it is across from where I live, even if I am craving a pineapple Mojito. I am discovering that there are many other options in close proximity to me.....You NEVER know who your customers are! I've been in the restaurant business for over 30 years in New York, Paris and Las Vegas and have moved to PHX, to live and open a restaurant here....Oh, yeah, and I happen to be one of the Top Chefs in America:-)

HerbThe Wrigley Mansion is one of a few historical venues in a city that does not value its past and history. That said, you would think that fact would guarantee a top quality meal and fine dining experience at Geordie's Restaurant. Regrettably, Geordie's turned out to be no better than any other overly-hyped but underwhelming restaurant one would find at a 4- or 5-star resort.

I have lived in the Valley for nearly 10 years, and last night was the first time I had ever visited the Wrigley Mansion. I always felt somewhat guilty for never have visited, but I can say with near 100% certainty that my first visit is also my last. The service and wait staff performed well, but the food was the equivalent of one might get at Applebee's, and certainly not worth what I paid.

I started off with the carpaccio, which was probably the most disappointing part of the meal. I have had some mediocre carpaccio before, but never this poorly prepared. I suspect a bad cut of beef. I also ordered a side of their white truffle fries that arrived with excessive garlic. The fries themselves were overcooked and tasted like Jack In The Box fries. Generous amounts of catsup were required to make them somewhat edible. For the entrée I tried the server-recommended lamb chop, which I requested to be prepared medium. When it arrived, it was clearly not medium. The meat was tough and lacked any flavor, and the au jus was entirely too salty.

The beverage service was quite prompt, however I think the bartender should go back to mixology school. The Manhattan I ordered had too much vermouth and hardly any bitters, while the lemon drop was neither sweet or bitter.

The purpose of the evening was to celebrate a friends birthday, so our dinner party had a whole room to ourselves. Given the size of the party, the wait staff did do an excellent job of making sure we were well served. Our glasses were never empty and the food did arrive promptly. Unfortunately, that alone could not make up for the poor food quality and exorbitant price.Not the Dunkin Donuts that everyone remembers.

Two tiny shelves of stale donuts...I guess when the grocer is selling your way overpriced coffee like gangbusters, you can forget what got you there in the first place.This place sucks. Food was average and we had to wait an hour even though we had a reservation. My americano tasted like warm soy sauce and they blamed it on the RO system. The owner made all sorts of excuses and took a whopping $50 off our $1100 bill. We won't be back!I have been to Different Pointe of View with my family for Easter years ago.  Last night was my first time back to the restaurant and could not have been more disappointed.  In walking into the restaurant you are greeted by a very musty, nasty smell.  The upkeep of the interior could use some work.  The view, as always, is beautiful but that is about it.  The food was mediocre but priced at fine dining prices.  Would not go back. Almost forgot, while waiting for our car I noticed the menu posted in a case outside.  The case had a Yelp sticker on it.  How tacky for a fine dining restaurant.Don't waste your money this was the worst Chinese I've ever had.  Absolutely bland flavorless food I think they keep there costs down be removing all the ingredients from there dishes.Surly old lady working the counter on my day and believe me, I caught the vibe quite clearly and won't be back.  Ice cream didn't taste quite right, and the Blizzard ingredients seemed stale and unchewable.  Yuck.  Tummy gurgles for an hour after consumption.  Not good.Upon moving to Arizona I had been using Frist Credit Union to do my banking because they offer shared banking with my credit union in Nebraska.  The process was easy to just go in and deposit money into my Nebraska account.  After awhile I decided I should open an account here in Arizona.  I went in and opened my account and everything was good for a short time.  I would bring in my checks and be able to have my funds available right away.  One Friday I brought my paycheck in and they said they had to verify my employment in order to put the check in my account.  Weird since they did that the first day I opened my account and weird since they had already cashed a couple of my paychecks.  Also, the company I work for is a huge company and has been in business since 1974.  So they called my work, verified my employment, deposited the check and the funds were available.  Next payday I go in and the same thing happens, they say they have to verify my employment...I am a little over it at this point.  They call and do their thing and deposit the check.  Next payday, same thing.  At this point I am getting upset because there is no reason to keep having to verify my employment.  I have worked there for 7 years!  I ask about this and tell them I am getting upset by this and the acted as though they really didn't care.  I needed my money so she calls, verifys my employment and comes back tells me there will  be a 10 day hold on my check. Seriously???  They have been cashing my checks since day 1 with no problems.  I put up a fuss and she tells me she will cut it down to a 4 day hold.  What???  So she can just make her own rules???  I told her to forget it and deposit it in my shared account in Nebraska.  She got really rude with me and told me they would put a hold on it also.  I looked her in the eye and told her to do it and I assured her they would never put a hold on any deposit in my account.    She deposited the money and guess what??? The money was immediatly available.  I told her to close my account because I was so pissed off.  She then told me I would be charged $35 to close it!!!  What???  She said it was stated in the paperwork I got when I opened my account... I looked through it all and I have nothing that states this.  To sum this up, DO NOT GIVE THIS CREDIT UNION YOUR MONEY!  They seem to have forgotten that they need our money, we don't need them.  There are a lot of  banks out there that are happy to have your money.You can't put lipstick on a pig to make her pretty. Same goes for this Walmart. It might have been remodeled but the people they employ has not changed. What a bunch of slackers! My son and I stood at the bakery for a good 10 mins while the ladies working there were looking through a book. I said, "excuse me" several times but was ignored. We finally gave up.

Went to the electronics department looking for printer ink and was completely ignored. I was told by several associates they would be right back....never came back.

Made my way over to the clearance on Christmas paper etc.. It was busy (duh!), but there were associates pushing through people to stock merchandise on the shelves. I get they need to restock, but the shelves were full! Not to mention packed with people. Then they would sit there and huff and puff that they couldn't get their job done. 

Finally get to the register (there were 3 open, the day after xmas). Was able to pay fairly quickly considering the cashier was also a manager that was getting called away every 5 seconds.

I HATE this Walmart and I would rather pay double somewhere else.I took my car to Cobblestone for an oil change and car wash combo because I had a coupon to save a couple bucks.

The moment I pulled up to the service center the employees started to try to pressure me into additional (expensive) add-ons.  No man, I don't want to buy an $80 pre-paid card to get my car detailed, I just want it friggin' washed and I want to go home.

I talk to the guy in the shop and he tried to sell me crap to go along with my oil change too.  I say no, I don't want to get my coolant system flushed today, so he offers to knock $10 off the price.  That just makes me realize how much he was overcharging me to begin with.

Let me be clear, the car wash service was excellent!  I got what I paid for, but it wasn't worth the hassle.

------------------------
EDIT:
I go to this place to get gasoline because it's near the house.  The other day, while I was filling up, I watched as Cobblestone employees took gas from the pump, dumped it on the ground and lit it on fire.  
My god!  Fire and gas stations DON'T MIX!  I hope they all explode and remove themselves from the gene pool!omg. worst mexican "food" ever.

looking for a mexican food place on the way home from the cave creek area, we happened upon this place's relatively good reviews and decided to give it a shot. i ordered the chile relleno plate and my date ordered a chicken quesadilla. apparently the chicken quesadilla wasn't bad. but of my two chile rellenos, only one of them found it's way to the microwave, since the bottom was cold, and the cheese was hard. the beans were gray they had so much lard in them. this plate was hard to look at, let alone eat. i will not be coming back here again.Bought a set of Titleist golf clubs here about 6 months ago.  They just didn't work for me so decided to sell them to a broker.  Turns out the clubs were COUNTERFEIT.  Attempted to bring them into the store to get a refund but was only offered store credit.  Employee informed me that he is also losing on the deal since he has to know dispose of them.  I don't see how that would be a customer's issue, but my protests didn't matter.   I realize that they aren't a Titleist retailer, but it seems pretty unfair not to refund someone's money on counterfeit merchandise.  If they can't identify authentic equipment, I'd be extra cautious about buying any golf equipment from them (even with a store credit).The other reviews are pretty accurate.  These guys don't take the time to do anything more than push the dirt around.  Definitely won't be going back here.This restaurant is off my list for good. There was a time in different states that I would have considered them pretty good. Things have changed and it appears to be nationwide. The service was terrible...we received the "what do you want, your bothering me" attitude from our young female server on an early Saturday night last weekend. Our biggest clue should have been the now hiring sign that we joked about in the parking lot hoping it wasn't cooks. Our order was incorrect and I'm fairly positive the chicken in my 3 sauce burrito was frozen. It was perfectly cubed and had a squishy consistency. My friends veggie burrito came with chunks of partially cooked zucchini, squash and red peppers. The rice was just as bad.
The only thing I found appealing were the re fried beans. 
Add a $5 draft beer and voila, unhappy customer.Bad business practice. Poor management. They do not back up their employees mistakes. Be aware of their cancellation policy upfront. If an employee says something to you, you may want to get it in writing, video taped and notarized as they do NOT own up to their mistakes. My problem was partially resolved which still unacceptable to me. Our family will NOT look at LA Fitness for gym needs in the future. 

Facility- this particular location at night is mainly frequented by muscle head male members. It was a little uncomfortable to me being the only women in the place most nights I came in. I did not come in during the day. Some nights smelled funny and others smelled of tons of chemicals. I did not use this facility enough to comment on the equipment or anything else. I never interacted with the staff, only the front door person. 

The sales people I interacted with is very pushy and annoying. They will not stop calling you. LA Fitness is about numbers not retention or quality service.The only positive and knowledgeable person at this store is Chris (male) not the female Manager Chris. I truly wonder how this location survives due to all the inconsistencies an lack of communication. I had to file a claim due to their lack of properly packaging my gift item and now a month later its still no where. I will now start to using the Ray Road location. STAY AWARE FROM CHANDLER LOCATION! Chris (male) transfer to a different location it will benefit you tremendously!!!We've moved away from chain restaurants due to the lack of service we typically receive.  I almost felt judged by the server because we weren't dressed up.  I mean, we were in jeans and t-shirts, but didn't look like bums.  The food was terrible too.  The server seemed annoyed that he had to bring us extra calamari sauce and was difficult to find.  They claim their pasta is homemade and "al dente", but really it was just undercooked.  I've had fresh pasta before and never had it served so hard, or sticking together.  I doubt we'll ever come back.Used to be the best pizza in Arizona, until the new owners took over.  Everything changed and it's terrible now.  Not only was the food bad (greasy and think crust) but I bought a Groupon coupon and when I went to use it they said they wouldn't honor it.  So I lost out on that deal.  Last time I'll be going there.I thought I did enough research before I had Lodi install my garage doors.  The sales part of it was pretty good. I guess i assumed too much ,  in thinking that my sales rep would at least try and match the door to the color of my entire house.... Installation was ok too....  although the auto door opener was mounted on the wall...and wired to the motor in a very "elementary " fashion to say the least....just sort of wrapped the wire around piping and draped across the ceiling.   No biggie. But I had problems with the keypad mounted outside...will not take the programming.  I had the repair rep out....  could not make it work ....he said it was a discontinued model, ( or something like that?)  He would look into it?  After hearing nothing I called back again...they want $85.00 for a service call?????  I explained the situation to the guy that answered....he said" $85.00 and we will come look at it.   No wonder they gave me a "good price" on the door opener that i bought?????  So NO outside keypad i guess.    I will NOT have them back !!!Last night for dinner my Texas T-bone was under cooked and tough. Returned and was brought another T-bone under cooked and tough. Half rack of ribs were old and dry, sirloin overcooked. I ordered Mug a Rita (margarita in a mug) advertised in the lobby for $2.49. Paid my bill and at home realized they charged my $12 for my two Mug a Rita's. Server great, noise, food sucked, won't be back. Best steaks are from a meat market and grilled at home on my Weber. Wish I had my $100 back. Oh, get rid of the cinnamon butter. Yuck!!horrible service, horrible spray tan both times I went. customer service from Courtney and Amanda are horrible. Courtney was telling Amanda what to say when I just called, I heard someone giving Amanda information to tell me what I should do, so I asked to speak to the person in the background. I could hear Courtney laughing and they covered the phone.  Then Courtney got on the phone and said the reason she didn't get on the phone was because she was off the clock and she usually doesn't talk on the phone off the clock. They keep telling me to call the corporate office to resolve my issues, when I call the corporate office it goes directly into voice mail.  I have called twice now with no call back so I called the original store back to have them refund my money.  They can't refund money at the local stores only corporate can do that.  Do not ever go here ever for your spray tan. I have had beautiful spray tans from other locations and wanted to try out Celebrity Tanning because they are right around the corner from me.  To top if all off I have a movie premier tonight that I will be speaking at and I look like an ooompa loompa, with drip stains and horrible spots on hands and back.  Its like their bottles of spray are clumpy and spray too much solution out at different time.Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. In every way this place is a hell-hole and it's terrible. Do not buy meat or produce from here. Take my word for it, you will be sorry. Customer service is non-existent. Cheap prices but it is never an easy in & out at this place. Over crowded with trashy people. I'm so sick of this place I just cannot go back. I've been to other Wal-Marts that are not this terrible.About ten years ago a group of handicapped students from Apache Junction had semi-monthly, scheduled visits to Mesa East Bowl that served both as recreation and a chance to practice independent community skills. One day they show up at their reserved time and day to find all the lanes are taken. When they ask why no lanes are available, they are told a league had taken their place. No advance warning, no apology. The kids were terribly disappointed. I will NEVER give  EMB business, NEVER!Started out pretty well, they seemed honest and competent. After spending hundreds of dollars and not getting my spa working completely now I'm getting the run around. Also when I was told this repair would cost "not a lot maybe $40" they finally came back and had all these excuses for the cost of $160!!  That's FOUR TIMES THE ESTIMATE!!! To me that's not a trivial amount of $. There was also no crediting of that initial (almost $100) fee towards the repair, which I specifically asked how they handle that "diagnosis fee". So... Be careful when SpaBuster's tells you a price, notice it's never concrete & given the chance their slippery nature surfaces.  Make sure you get everything in writing with these guys so if you get screwed big time you can take them to court. Wish I had gone with a different company. Ill be going that way from now on.I send flowers every week and I wanted to make sure this flower shop could accommodate.  I called the store to speak with the manager and he was out to lunch. I was told by the girl working there that he would call me back when he returned.  He never returned my call. 

A couple days later I sent an email and no response.

If this is what they call customer service,  they are not worth my money.I brought my son and grandkids for lunch and we were very disappointed.  Said the outside wasn't open yet; it was 1PM...the pizza and Stromboli's were burnt!  I don't think I will be back; maybe the first two times I went was the flook and this is the for real.The owner  was extremely unprofessional, belligerent and rude! When I tried make a return, the owner first refused to give me my money back because it was longer than 30 days from date of purchase.  After some discussion, he said he would give me a refund but with a 20% restocking fee.  What!?!  a restocking fee?  Why?  His response was because "I am a small business"   You mean you are going to charge me to walk 5 feet and put something back on the shelf.   When I initially purchased my items, I specifically asked what the return policy was in case I needed to return them.  He said "You can return, no problem"  He said nothing about a 30 day policy and certainly nothing about 20% restocking fee.  I don't have a problem with a 30 day policy but it was not disclosed to me.  Had I known this I would have returned my item in this time frame.  I told him this policy was not told to me and no where was it posted in the store.  His response was he was again "I am a small business and I have nowhere to display this".  Really!?!  Like not on or by the register for people to read before they make a purchase?  When I moved something on the counter he then accused my of "breaking things in his store" and said he would call the police and have me kicked out of his store.  When I responded, he told me to stop talking.  I reminded him that this is a America and we have something called freedom of speech and that if he wants to continue in business he should operate in a responsible and professional way.  I will never give this store my business again.2 things that get me riled up against mom and pop restaurants is 1) Serving stale and potentially harmful food 2)Serving food that does not correspond to the definition in the menu.

Yangtse does this in abundance. I tried the wonton soup and the Szechuan style Dumplings. Firstly the second dish contained wontons not dumplings (I know not much difference in theory) but the wontons and the dumplings were the same. 
The hot sauce (which I asked if it was Ma La) had nothing to do with authentic "Ma La". Where is my szechuan peppercorns infused yumminess .. dude..!!

 
The pork in the wontons/dumplings were rancid, indicating frozen for ages, reheating in the morning and serving in the evening kind of food.

Do I have to be dissuaded everytime to ever try Chinese cuisine in the valley!! Sigh...I met eric and was not impressed with his insulting comments regarding me purchasing a platinum ring. Which my finance already has. He seemed to attempt to make me,regret for buying a metal 3 times the worth and more rare than gold. 
He said I will regret buying this ring and everyone regrets platinum. Knowing I had already purchased it and more competitive than he could ever match. He's a typical shyster 
I walked out of his store regretting something I worked so hard to purchase for my future wife. 
The purest metal he compares to a painted metal.Filthy. Watched the bus person "clean" the table with food still left beneath seat from guest before us. Menu left on the ground next to that food. Table top dirty, silverware filthy.
This place is about turning tables, not experience. Never again.I went in to Dr Lines for a skin cancer screening on June 6th and he found two pre-cancer spots and froze them off, one on my arm and one under my left eye. The spot on my left eye cause swelling so I stayed home from work the following day. Because I drive a commercial truck, I needed a doctors note to return to work after the swelling went down. When I called Dr Lines on the phone afterwards for a return to work note, he stated that if he had to write doctor notes for all his patients that that's all he'd been doing. He was rude and uncooperative for a simple doctor note for my work. I'll be looking for a different dermatologist.Mmmmmk so I went to Shane Co 

Staff are stuck up and to busy to help you. Will I go back nope no noppie.Very bad customer service.  I called them to inquire about purchasing a floral arrangement for a funeral. Granted it was a holiday weekend but the holiday schedule on their website indicated they were open on that day. 

The women whom I spoke to, told me they were not open on that Sunday and also, rather smugly told me the mortuary would not accept deliveries on that day.  She told them I had to pick up the flowers today (friday), before they closed at 3pm and hold them on my own until the funeral.  When I explained to her I was not from the area and apologetically asked her if there were other florists in the area she might recommend I try given the situation, she didn't even bother to make a suggestion. Instead, she rudely told me that there probably weren't any that would be open, that their store had the most extensive hours in the city vs. other florists and besides that the mortuary would not accept delivery on Sundays.  

Regarding her last comment.  I contacted the mortuary and they confirmed that they were accepting deliveries that day.  They too seemed surprised by Cactus Flower's attitude.

Perhaps Cactus Flower's other locations are more professional or maybe I just caught this person on a bad day (she probably shouldn't have even bothered showing up for work today).  The person I spoke to obviously didn't want any business that weekend.  I agree, save your time and find another florists.  

Another florist worth trying because they were much more helpful:  Enchanted Florist.Had dinner there Sunday evening.  I have been in the valley 12 years, and this is the worst food that I have ever been served.  A piece of veal that was most  likely left over from Friday or Satuday night.  They probably put it in the microwave.  It could not be cut with a knife, dried out, a grease ball.  They should not serve dreck like that, and charge you for it.  The waiter looked, as far as clean hands, like he just finished doing the yard work there.  A shame that we wasted so much money on a horrible dinner.  Even the pasta they served on the side was total grease.  They took away the large salad we ordered that was half eaten without even asking.   That was rude.

I realize it was a Sunday evening, but, please, do not serve such inferior food, and please wear a clean outfit if you are going to serve the public food.  I will never go back there, and will let my friends know what a horrible experience we had.I scheduled an appointment with the Dr. He never came in. The PA came in for 5 minutes. He barely did a physical exam. Never even tested for reflexes! Complained to the office manager. Had to track her down and keep calling to reach her. Horrible practicioners and patient service. I found another Dr. Complete different attitude. She did a complete physical exam and spent time with me. Never go to AZ Center for Pain!!!I also purchased a Groupon for this place a few months ago and it is set to expire this week.  So I called up a friend to meet me for breakfast today, a Saturday, and started on the 41.9 mile drive from Litchfield Park.  I was on their website yesterday and no where did it say anything about them being closed today, but when I got there all I found was a sign saying they were closed today, but would be open again Sunday.  That didn't really help me since I was so far from home and the Groupon wasn't good on Sundays.  Of course the sign was posted just to the side of the sign on the window that says they are open everyday...except today, I guess.  They also had signs saying they no longer accept Entertainment Book coupons, but if they put themselves in the book, they should honor it.  A third sign states that if you use your credit card for less than $10, they would charge you an extra $1 which is quite a bit more than the percentage they would be charged for a purchase so small.  From what I saw this place is on the fast track to shutting down for good...save your money.  However, The Joyful Chinese place in the same complex was delicious and a great deal for the money.We picked this place thinking that it would be similar to our Marriott Canyon Villa. We had a lock-off available so we booked this place..WOW what a disappointment. Converted apartment complex, old furnishing, no internet, no elevators. Dirty couches, extremely old bathroom. A very depressing place, which we only stayed a few days and book the rest of our week at the Canyon Villas...I will never book a week at a Diamond Resort again.  This is the second time we stayed at one and it was disgusting.  We did spend a couple nights in the Desert Oasis, a brand new unit absolutely beautiful... So if you like old, crappy units this one is for you.Pushy sales person - he kept asking WHY we did not want to pay more for tires!  He claimed the affordable tires were "not in stock" - he did not refer us to another store or attempt to order them - he kept insisting that we buy the more expensive tires.  They did not get our business!  Very offensive, intrusive, and unprofessional experience-  I do not recommend this location or company.I'll have to find another option. The quality of my pedicure was great and the nail technicians were like robots; there's no enjoyment there at all.The drive-thru at this location is not unlike the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway.

*The Apapa-Oshodi Expressway, the gateway to Nigeria's two busiest seaports, Apapa and Tin Can Island, is home to the worst chronic gridlock in the world.Too inconsistent for me.  Crust tends to be overcooked so if like that, this is the place.  Ingredients are fine, especially the sausage.  NYC atmosphere is interesting and seating area small but adequate.How do restaurants like Joe's Crab Shack thrive?  Let me tell you a little story.  It might sound like I'm complaining about my (future) in-laws, but I'm not.  I promise.

My fiance's parents love the Crab Shack.  Every year, we all spend a week in Coronado, California for a much-needed escape from the desert.  Every year, we find ourselves driving across the bridge into San Diego in search of a crappy seafood dinner courtesy of Joe and his under-motivated teenage staff.  Every year, my meal both amazes and disappoints me.  How awful is a restaurant when it just keeps getting worse?  I am totally certain that the kitchen contains nothing but enormous bags of frozen seafood and deep-fryers the size of swimming pools.

One time, we had a waiter that kept calling all the men "bro."  I am not your bro.  I am paying for and eating food that would get even a Red Lobster cook fired and, as such, am entitled to no less than five-star treatment.

If there is anything positive to say, it is that the bibs they hand out to people eating crab are HILARIOUS.  I've got the pictures to prove it.

I'll visit the Shack once per year out of obligation.  I'll even be (sort of) happy to do it, considering those close to me seem to love it and I'm not going to rain on their parade.  You will never ever ever ever ever ever find me at one in Arizona, however.  Ever!Probably the worst Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. The food didn't even taste like Chinese food. The service is atrocious as well, the guy behind the counter even called me a dick as I walked out. Never going back there!This place was AWFUL. I was using the groupon so I had to call to make a reservation for my friend and I. As soon as I told the receptionist that I would be using the groupon, she tried to hang up on me. I told her she hadn't asked for my name yet, and she hurriedly asked what it was and hung up. 

Fast forward 2 weeks later and big surprise, she had not written my name or my friend's name down for our reservation. Luckily, it wasn't too busy and she had my friend and I sit in her chairs. Worst mistake ever. She started off very friendly; however, I noticed after 2 coats of white gel nail polish that the color on my nails did not resemble the color that i had picked that was on the sample nail set. As soon as I told her this, she told me that the sample nails were already white and that's why the nail polish did not look the same on my nails. False advertising much? She then tried to talk me out of having white nails because it would "look bad". After trying to convince her that I indeed wanted white nails, she hurriedly slapped on a few coats of white nail polish and went on to do my friend's nails. Worst quality ever. There were bubbles in my polish and a piece of random hair got stuck in the polish. She seemed very annoyed that I asked her to take the random hair out and fix my nail. 

When she asked my friend what color she wanted for her nails, my friend chose a white gel polish with sparkles, but asked the lady if the color was going to look the same as the sample (not wanting to go through the same hassle I went through). The lady responded by telling her that it was my fault that I wasn't satisfied with the color on my nails originally and that I was wrong. She then proceeded to wrap my friend's nails in foil and use the electric nail filer to take my friend's old nail polish off. She said she would have to CHARGE HER $3 FOR REMOVING HER NAIL POLISH. Her nail polish wasn't even gel or shellac, it was REGULAR NAIL POLISH for goodness sakes! As she was doing her nails, this lady kept muttering, "Oh my God" underneath her breath and did the WORST JOB EVER on both of our nails. We would have just gotten up and walked out except we had already purchased our groupon. This was the worst nail experience I've ever had. DO NOT GO TO MAGEN NAIL.Gorgeous views, that's about it. Service was beyond slow. Had reservation for table of 6 took 25 mins for drinks, 35 mins for our salads to come. Salads, not main course. No apology, nothing. If you are spending $50+ a head you want a certain level of service and it definitely was not provided at this place. 1 star for the view as it is awesome. Would never come back here again and would not recommend any friends to come here to eat due to horrendous service.Do not go here for a manicure/pedicure.  I was seduced by a $20 off coupon and am still regretting it.  Although the staff greets you with a smile and offer of a beverage it quickly went downhill from there.

This is not a relaxing atmosphere; it's very noisy from the large opening into the lobby and floors above. It did seem clean, I'll give them that.

The nail tech has been doing this reportedly for a year.  I left with a sub-par manicure and more importantly a blister and raw skin on my heel from over aggressive filing.  
I actually pulled my foot back purely by reaction to her rough work....after already asking her to be more gentle. 

I received a request for a review directly from Life Spa and reported the above mentioned and have yet to hear from them.....not cool!

I would not recommend this salon.  The prices warrant a much better experience and qualified technician.Every time we go here it gets worse and worse. Dirty, rude employees, and less and less flavor. All three of ours were white snow at the bottom. Worst location! Clean it up and treat people well!I really dislike this entire chain.  I have eaten a few and have not been impressed.  They make these burritos look huge by packing them in flavorless overcooked rice then put a few ingredients on.  They have additional items that you can buy a la carte to put on your burrito to add flavor, but you'd think they would be included.  This is Tex-Mex cafeteria food.I recently moved to Phoenix and looked up hair cut salons close to my house to get a cut. Based on the reviews, I thought I would try this place out. That was a mistake. I had a #1 fade done and was not impressed at all with the outcome. Luckily for me, my hair grows back fairly quickly, but it is even growing out weird due to the cut. Needless to say, I will not be going back here.Very rude customer service. I had came to drop off and pick up a prescription for my son and noticed three boxes of diapers for 18.99 each. I go to pay and the rude man says it's 28.99. I go back to show him that there was more then one and it showed the price for 18.99. He replies "that's for another brand and I'm not giving it to you for that price" Could he have been any more ruder. I mean I know it was close to midnight and he might have been moody and tired but this will be the last time I step into this Walgreens.had a business casual lunch planned at the stir fry which was next door to Carambas (was as the stir fry is now closed)  We decided to go to Carambas and it was disgusting. I had two carne asada tacos and a side of rice. The meat tasted spoiled and the rice was sick.  If this was not bad enough there was a fly that kept buzzing both of us- most likely could not resist the bad meat that sat on my plate. Stay away from this place and save your money.I simply called to get some info about t-moble. And curious about the data plan and the process. And the mister i was talking over the phone was an AssHole very rude, and doesn't give a shit about new costumers.I have liked this place in the past, but it all went downhill today.  Our school's PTSA set up a fundraiser "Spirit Day" two months ago with the owner, Nick.  Today, I took my boys and their friend for lunch right after getting out of their last day of school at 12:20pm.  The boys each ordered two slices of pizza and a drink.  I let the cashier know that we were from West Wing and he looked at me very puzzled.  I told him we were from West Wing School, you know the fundraiser?  He asked if I had a flyer and I said know, but we were told it was okay to just say we were from West Wing.  So, I contacted our Spirit Dinner Nights Chair person and she spoke with him.  When he got off the phone with her, he said "Everything is all good, I've had four fundraisers this week."  No apologies, but I was happy that he said everything was good.  I talked to the Chair person and she said he would accept people saying they were from West Wing and if they had a flyer.
Six slices of pizza took 40 minutes and they were soggy, dripping grease. :(  But, we still were having a good time and the pizza crust was good.
We left Brothers Pizza and not even 15 minutes later I get a call from the Spirit Dinner Nights Chair and she tells me a family from West Wing just went into Brother's Pizza and told them they were from West Wing, the cashier asked if they had a flyer and they said the did not have one.  The cashier said then no money will go to West Wing from your order.  So that family walked out!
Wow, I cannot believe a business would let people just walk out.  I cannot believe the owner, Nick, lied to my face and lied to my Chair person over the phone!
I can promise you this, I will not go back to Brother's Pizza, nor recommend it.  Bad business, bad customer service.The food was awful, the service was worse and I was sorry that out of all the places to go in that area we chose this one.  It was not my choice and will never be the choice of anyone in our family again.  The food was overcooked, not what was ordered or cold..take your pick!  The waitress that did finally show up to take our order never showed up again but we got two other waitresses that refilled our drinks all wrong and one looked at me crazy when I told her we ordred fries instead of this big mushroom cap with spinach on top!  So the plate comes back with cold fries AND the mushroom!  Yuck.  The steaks were over cooked and oh so small.  The portions have shrunk but the prices have gone up.My first time eating here... Oh my goodness... why would anyone eat here food is gross.  worst chicken  ever, it was like rubber.This place is packed in tight. Always looks liked it has been ransacked. I have been in there two different occasions to get the Ulta brand mineral make-up and both times they only had two shades available. I only go in when necessary.Just go to Tokyo Lobby on 59th and bell. Better prices, happy hour, and by far better food. I was only going to Ah So cause it was cheap and all I knew about.I've been boycotting this store since 2009.  One afternoon after browsing for a while with my kids, I allowed my 10yo and 8yo to stay in the children's section to pick out a book to spend their allowance money on while I ran next door to TJ Maxx to buy the toddler a pair of shoes.  I'd been gone 30 minutes when I returned to find the horrid lady in the children's section had called the police on us.  She never asked the kids  their ages and didn't ask if they had a way to reach me (they did).  The police talked to them, realized they were perfectly well behaved consumers, and assured me I'd done nothing illegal.  Avoid like the plague.This is the second time I have been here and both times I encountered doctors who really short with me and acted bothered that they had to explain things to me. Today though, the woman who helps the doctor (I'm not really sure what her title is) was completely unprofessional. She stood outside the door of the room I was in and complained to the doctor about me saying she didn't know why I came back to the office if I didn't like the prescription I was given last time. Completely rude! I guess she got her wish though because I certainly won't be going back there.Avoid this place. They are just trying to hustle you for more services that you don't really need. 
You don't really need an engine flush unless you spilled contaminants in the engine. Every customer walking in, they are just trying to scam them. 
I really wish to save any more people from falling into their trap.Bleech. Welcome to the chain that Sysco loves. If you love uninspired, bland, boring food that helps give chain restaurants their hated reputation you've found the right place. If you like waits due to slow or no service this is your place. If you really want to see someone try and create a faux New Orleans environment and come up woefully short at the feeble attempt, this is your place. About the closest this would come to New Orleans would be Slidell, LA style. Slidell is a small city just North of Lake Pontchartrain and I'll just leave that slam hanging...

I would much rather eat late 1970's high school cafeteria food than be forced to choke down what is served here. And if you want a "New Orleans" experience with your food you're better off finding your closest Popeye's Chicken for something that's Louisiana fast vs. the stuff they bring to your table, which in the case of this Henderson location is usually: A: Cold  B: Not what you ordered C: Overpriced for what you get. Pick 2 of those choices on almost every visit. 

How this chain has proliferated is a testament to Sysco's ability to keep bulk food prices down, and for people to tolerate crappy food and even crappier service. 

In short, you would be better off scouring Yelp for the absolute worst Las Vegas casino buffet and going there vs. eating here. At least there's Walgreens and CVS's close by for the Pepto and Tagamet you'll need after the fact. And as I'm writing this I realized it's not far from the Mongolian grill that made me sick too. Is there something about the East side of Stephanie, just South of Sunset that is destined to have crappy food? I'm beginning to wonder.Stepping through the door is like going back in time and not in a good way! Waited nearly 10 min to be acknowledged by a server then when prompted she only knew one of the multiple specials on at the time. Also as a brewery I'd highly suggest training your staff on styles of beer. Dark is not an adequate description and all beers are not lagers. I'm sure the food menu hasn't changed since the doors first opened so we didn't have the guts to order what surely would be frozen food microwaved to half life.I do realize places like this have to manage the product closely to make the bottom line, but in this case it works against them. I think the public is aware of this because they were not getting the turn over to move the food of the counter. So in summary the food tastes old. My family came into this location at 4:00 pm.  Was it too far away from lunch and dinner rush? What ever the answer maybe... I can't recommend this location.One star is for great service...but

The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.

The definition of dining insanity is going to the same restaurant after you swore you would never go there again and expecting the food to be good!

On TV I saw... "Fried Lobster Bites" which are two things I love: lobster and a light crispy breading (or so the picture on the TV represented them as "lightly coated nuggets of wonder").   Shame on me... what I got were overcooked erasers with a breading that was so thick it could have doubled as arctic parkas for tiny Eskimos.  The sauce had broken down, the corn on the cobb was dry, and gritts like paste. 

I will now stop the insanity.Stopped in for lunch with the wife. The place was deserted. 

We ordered the 2 for $20 deal, which is an appetizer to share and 2 entrees. We had our drink order taken immediately and we were served our drinks quickly. 

We waited about 35 or 40 minutes after getting our drinks with no food. I asked the server where the food was and she went into the back. When she didn't return after another 5 minutes, I saw the manager. I asked her if the kitchen was actually open or not. She looked surprised. I let her know that we had been waiting 40 minutes by that point. She promised a resolution and went into the kitchen.

After about 8 minutes, they delivered an order of Mozzarella Sticks to our table as our appetizer. The problem was that we didn't order that. We had ordered chicken wings. They left the Mozz sticks anyways and then went back into the kitchen. 

It was about 60 minutes from the time we were seated to when the appetizer and entrees we had ordered actually appeared at our table.

The manager came by to apologize. There was no explanation offered. And we got $5 taken off the check.

There are at least 20-30 other places for lunch within 3 miles of this place. I'd make this your last choice of all of them. Try the Spicy Pickle on Eastern and St Rose instead. There's also a Five Guys Burgers and a Chipotle.Pho Kim Long is Pho Kim WRONG. 
I didn't come for the Pho. We had the orange chicken and the black bean beef. Both orders including the rice disappointed.

The black bean beef was the better of the two dishes. The meat was chewy which I do not enjoy. There was about 5 tablespoons of oil at the bottom of the plate. Too greasy for me. 

The orange chicken looks delicious until you try to eat it. Some of the pieces of chicken had a really consistency. It's hard to describe. I'm scared it wasn't chicken at all. It was like no chicken I've ever had. Maybe it was old or frost bitten. The texture was not chicken. I could not get my around eating it at all. 

Rice. How do you mess up rice?  The white rice was over cooked and somewhat mushy. The brown rice was undercooked and hard. 

Service was initially very fast but we had to wait forever for our bill.   I was there on a Saturday night around 12a and the wait was short. 

With all the places Vegas has to offer. I would never go back to this dump.The first time that we went there it was awesome, since then we have been there three of four more times and it was more disappointing each time (and no we are not bad tippers).  The food is great and I really like the menu but the service is so terrible it ruins the entire experience.  They have a team service approach where any of the waiters can wait on you, but instead of the service being excellent they are just trying to push you out the door and you do not receive attentive service at all.  When I am paying $200 for dinner I expect the food to be excellent and the service to be professional.  The last time that we went there after we had been seated for about 15 minutes and a busser had brought us water a waiter came up to our table smacking gum, leaned on the table, clicked his pen and said "are you ready to order?"  WHAT!!!!!  This is something that I would expect at a Denny's not at a high end steak house.  I was actually mad that the waiter was so abrupt and I thought the gum chewing was DISGUSTING.  

We explained that we were not ready to order quite yet and he just turned and walked away.  A couple minutes later another waiter comes up and says "are you ready to order?  There was no introduction, didn't ask us if we had been there before and did not discuss the menu at all.  We finally ordered and another waiter brought our food out.  There was an issue with how the steak was cooked but we had to sit there waiting trying to catch a waiter's attention.  After sitting there for about 10 minutes not eating a waiter finally came over and asked if everything was OK (a different waiter).  We explained that there was an issue and he took the steak back.  

I am actually sorry that the service is so bad because I like the restaurant, but when waiters are unprofessional and discourteous it ruins the experience for me.  The prices are commensurate with high-end steak houses on the strip but the service is not.No coffee ready at 5 am? Really. Nothing much else to say.Overpriced, poor, poor communication, and last minute preparation during the wedding ceremony left us VERY disappointed with this highly rated florist. 
Confusing estimate, which turned out to be higher at the last minute. 

In addition, the threats to not take anything or additional charges would be incurred was uncomfortable for the bride and groom.I came into the shop right when they opened to grab some pastries and pork buns for a quick breakfast. When I entered, there was no one attending. The cashier, or whoever, was in the back doing something so I couldn't ask questions. When the cashier finally came some out, she seemed like she woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I don't know if it was just me or what, but she was so rude. I asked to microwave the pork buns and so at first she didn't want to, then she took it and when she came back with it heated, she just threw the pork buns at me and my bf. Also, she was rude letting us know that there was a limit of $10 to use debit/credit.

Anyway, I ended up getting the pork buns and it was okay. It wasn't the steamed pork buns that I usually get at a different bakery, but it wasn't bad.

I also got the coconut macaroons and that.. I loved! I love coconut macaroons and it tasted so fresh and it was made that day! 

If the cashier wasn't so rude, I would have given this place maybe 4 stars because of their coconut macaroons! Other than that, I wouldn't really come back.SLOWEST SERVICE EVER..... 3 years later and i finally get to order.

Employee doesn't speak english that well....

EXPENSIVE $7 Large Milk tea... 

Luckily SJ only cost about $4 for a large to please my ADDICTION!This store focuses on store policies than customer service.I Love classic coke, but was sadly disappointed when I had a coke from the McDonald's at 1343 Silverado Ranch blvd in Las Vegas. This is the third time I've tasted poorly mixed Co2 and syrup at this location. Are they trying to cut cost by dispensing more Co2 then syrup? I would have returned to the store to complain, but I had driven off by the time I took my first taste. Someone or the Coca Cola Rep please change the bag in the box or balance the mix so I can taste a true coke, I would hate to cross over to another brand over this continued issue at this McDonald location. I expect my coca cola experience to be excellent with each drink I consume.Listen up! Just because the pizza restaurant people are from New York don't always expect the pizza will be good. There are plenty of awful pizza restaurants in New York. I know, I lived there most of my life. This place is just mediocre and I don't eat there any more.I too really liked him at first. 

I am recently relocated and was searching for an og/gyn for general care.  He was very personable and pleasant in our first meeting.  Interested in my history and attentive to what I was telling him.

But when I had to have an ultrasound, trying to follow up to find out the results (or when they might get the results) was impossible.  I called multiple times over several days before anyone returned my calls. I tried to relay that I had had an upsetting experience with the ultrasound (which is not the ob/gyn's fault in any way) that made me anxious to hear results. 

When the Dr called me with the results a week later, he was very aloof and different.  He did not mention that he was aware I had been trying to find out the results.  And when I brought it up, trying to relay that I might be dissatisfied (in case he didn't even know) he got angry with me.  I was actually waiting for him to hang up on me.  

My basic common courtesy expectation that my call(s) be returned in somewhat timely fashion (within 24hrs) by anyone in his office , if only to let me know that they had not yet received results, apparently was unreasonable according to him.  He actually told me "he is a busy man" and if I wanted that kind of attention he could put a note in my chart.  I cannot believe that sort of basic service requires special notation in a chart.

I will not be seeing this Dr again.Worst customer service you can come across!  Stood at the front desk for atleast 3 minutes while 2 employees finished up their personal conversation.  I was there to buy a galaxy tab so she took my name and told me it would be 15 to 20 minutes.  I kind of lost time because I was sending texts and emails while I waited.  I noticed a lot of people started to complain so I looked at the time since my first text message was sent and it had been 45 minutes!  I went to the counter and asked where I was on the list,  she told me it would be 15 to 20 minutes!  When I told her she said that 45 minutes ago she snaps back and says "sir these are estimates only" which at that point I turned around and walked out.  I wasted almost an hour of my time and they could care less.  I work in an industry where we have long wait times as well so I get it but it's all about how you come off to customers which most of the time you can turn a negative experience into a positive one.  I've never been to this store before and I won't be back.  I recently switched from at&t to sprint and have been very happy with sprint's service.  Corporate should really take a long look at this horrendous store and realize they are jepordizing their brand with stores like this one! I ended up going to best buy and was in and out in 15 minutes including activating my service.  Like I said I'm happy with sprint an will continue to support them its just a shame on how bad the retail store is!This place was horrrrrible! I worked there for a while and saw things that I  didn't see at other NORMAL day cares. They yell at the kids and the kids are always sick! They got me sick a bunch of times.Poor employee treatment. They don't pay for MANDATORY meetings. I got written up for not attending a meeting. Also, make you wait for ever to clock in. Many of the employees don't want to be there and you can tell by how they treat the kids. One kid got in trouble for not eating all the food when I specifically told them she didn't like Ranch. 

Sometimeswas left with an uneven ratio.  Kid's would grab eachothers foodLet me first say that I've eaten at every Super-Mex restaurant in Calif. since 1982. I love the food and service at all of them from Long Beach to Riverside so when we moved to Vegas we expected the same food but that didn't happen. They changed the menu for the worse, raised their prices and shrank the plate size. The Machaca and eggs was burnt one time I went. Another time I ordered the Chile Verde burrito and got 3 pieces of meat in the whole thing. A third time I got the two tacos plate and there was hardly any meat in the tacos. The rice tasted burnt and the beans were really bland. Not sure what happened but I won't ever go back to locations in NV. I'll wait till I'm back in Lakewood, CA whrere they know how to cook.This place has given me one of my best cross cultural misunderstandings. And I don't mean that in a good way. What a flop, Mr. Chop Chop. 

My wife and I went there for lunch recently and when we walked in there on a table off to the side was this amazing dish sitting there beckoning to us. It had this whole fried fish and was surrounded by bok choy and beautiful steamed vegetables. It gave off this spicy, rich aroma. I thought it was an offering table. 

So I say to the gal, I want some of that. She replied, Oh, that's not on the menu. I said, Oh, too bad, are you sure? To which she says that's a special table. Ahhhhhh. So we order some items we think will be close to as good as that smell. 

What we got was Won Ton soup. It was a disappointment. It was gummy, the meat was hardened, the broth tasteless. We also got some dish that was so unmemorable that all I remember is that is was dry, flat tasting, and the rice crunchy. I was getting really put off at that point, then the kicker, the chef and all the workers sat down at the beautifully decorated table and proceeded to consume the fish dish with gusto and relish. 

But, we, the customer, were succinctly ignored, and feed what amounted to a Rice Bowl To Go serving that was overpriced, horribly cooked, and poorly served. Way to go, Mr. Chop Chop. 

Not only did I feel cheated on what you served, but you saved the best for yourself, right in front of paying customers and myself. Tells me what you think of your business and the rest of your food. 

The best I can say is you Suck, Suck, Mr. Chop Chop.It was such a nice day I wanted to find a patio to sit on and drink a margarita. I was a little fooled by a review that mentioned "outdoor" seating. I guess I still can't wrap my head around all the fake b.s. that makes up this weird town. Yeah, no outdoors to be had. So I walk in and head for the bar.

Margaritas - boring and watered down. Nothing exciting and really I can't believe that a casino would make something so ridiculously weak. They were fairly cheap though so that was ok.

Chips and Salsa - Boring again. The bean dip and salsa had no flavor. The chips were kinda stale. I kept wishing there was flavor. None to be had.

Fajitas - Seriously, even Casa Bonita does a better job. God were they ho hum. I mean at least TRY to put a little flavor in there. 

Service - The guy was nice enough but it seemed like he was tired and burned out. He was trying to be nice but you can tell he's been in Las Vegas too long.

Atmosphere - It would have been ok but then some horrible music started up. Apparently, yet another cheesy, mouth breather "light show." The blaring sound of "Cotton Eyed Joe" had me practically running out the door. 

No, I won't be back. This is the first time I've been in Sam's Town and see NO REASON AT ALL to ever make it a second time. Place was just sad. I drove back home wondering if real Mexicans get irate at the insulting bastardization of their food. I KNOW this crap isn't what they eat. Save your money and go elsewhere. Anyone who has given this place a good review should stop reviewing anything because you CLEARLY have poor taste.I am so disappointed with Big O here.  They want my money, and do services that are totally unnecessary.  They have hidden charges, called fees, which are unneeded.  They wanted to do services that were not needed.. I just had some of the services they suggested just a few months ago.  And their prices are certainly not firm.  I would say that if you need car work, go elsewhere.  They lack a certain(any) amount of honesty.Today was the first and last time I come here! I came in for a full set of pink and whites and a pedicure. I was taken right away and motioned into the pedicure chair. One person worked on my feet, while the other, HOLLY, worked on my hands. Holly was trying to take off the old set of nails and started with the right hand pinky. Right away, I felt my actual nail rip past the nailbed. When I told her she proceeded to work on my middle finger, then to my index finger, then back to my pinky, where she tugged at my already bleeding nail. I told her to stop because it hurt. I mentioned I was in no hurry and that I wouldn't mind if she soaked my nails in acetone to remove them. She said, 'its not that, it's because you have gel on, you have gel on, don't you?' Then she grabbed an emery board and filed the nail right off, exposing the damage she had done to my nail. I got up, feet wet and all, and walked out. The whole walk to the door all she was saying was 'its because of the gel' and then something in her native tongue (probably rude). I guess I do have to thank her, though...her incompetence led me to another nail shop which I do believe I'll be going to from now on.WHAT A SCAM!!!
Saw the weekly albertso s ad that listed "rib roast"4.97 lb.
But when i went there i was suprised to find that you have to buy 20 LBS TO GET THAT PRICE!
I was not alone there were other shoppers demanding to see the manager.
I WILL NEVER SHOP ALBERTSONS AGAIN!Don't bother dropping of things for store credit as they will give you next to nothing and tell you 90% of your items aren't acceptable but they will take them as a donation. Give me a break, I'll donate my stuff to needy kids not a greedy store.If you are used to a full Panda Express restaurant don't bother with this mini version. They didn't have the beef & broccoli & they didn't have the steamed vegetables that my wife & I wanted. There wasn't much else either - minimal selection.They told me they could fix my car, but when they were done, they found more wrong with it.  A fifth grader could have done better.Their service department needs a lot of retraining. To make a long story short, I don't think they know the difference between a pair of pliers and a screwdriver. Gave them three chances to fix a minor problem which turned into a break down and a tow in 100 degree heat. Didn't even call them back to fix it a 4th time...going elsewhere.I can't quite understand why so many people like Buffet at Asia. My wife and I tried the Rainbow location a year or so ago and it was absolutely revolting. The serving areas were messy, the food overly greasy and unappealing and it all just felt extremely cheap and low-end.

Perhaps I am picky because I come from Australia where we can get amazing Chinese food (sort of like how in the US you can get great Mexican due to the proximity to Mexico). The fact that I don't eat fish or seafood of any kind didn't help either - The place was VERY heavy on the seafood.  Vegetarians won't he happy either, unless you are one of those fake "vegetarians" that thinks fish are vegetables.

The final nail in the coffin for us about this place where the signs on the walls saying that due to wastage, if you left any food on your plate you would be CHARGED EXTRA FOR IT! I mean -really- part of the beauty of a buffet is that you get to OWN the food and decide what to eat. I don't want to have to clean up my plate for fear of trouble with the management. I'd be interested to know if this ludicrous policy is still in place, but I have no desire to ever eat here again and will never know.Slow as Hell. 3 people working in the back and 2 customer in the lobby and me. Took forever to get my food. Not worth the wait.I came here when I first moved to Vegas needing a quick haircut. You get what you paid for is the lesson I learned. Service sucked the entire time. The hairdresser had this glub attitude about him. Avoid at all costs.Seriously?
Are these real reviews, brain-washed customers, zombies, sheep?
I suppose you have no clue what real gyros tastes like.
Stuck in Wisconsin forever?
This is absolute crap.
Do not waste your money.
Take a trip to Chicago if you want amazing gyros.
Pretty much anywhere you go, including the Kronos gyros in the various oasis off the highway. Hubs!
Even Milwaukee has better gyros.
People's Bakery in Madison has better gyros.As a native Madisonian I consider Porta Bella one of the cornerstone restaurants of city. It has been around forever and is part of the unique flavor of downtown. It has a really nice ambience and i used to enjoy going there in years past. That's why I was extremely disappointed  with my recent experience dining there. Basically the rating I've given is for a tasty salad & entree and mediocre dessert. The reason the rating is so low is because the service was HORRIBLE. We were seated promptly and from there the service went totally downhill. Our waitress was friendly but COMPLETELY clueless. What should have been a one-hour meal took THREE HOURS. The service was incredibly slow and the waitress put one of the entrees in completely wrong so the order had to be put in over again and one person had to wait for their food. But amazingly that didn't slow the dinner down as much as the waiting between courses. Our waitress clearly had no idea how to stay in touch with her tables, she disappeared for long periods of time. She would take simple requests for more water and would vanish for more than 10-15 minutes at a time. I would have thought this was a problem with the kitchen but just from watching our waitress i think the problem was her & not so much the kitchen. Although she was eventually apologetic about the wait I think she really was undertrained for her job and possibly the dumbest wait person I've ever encountered. She was friendly but just had no idea how to do things. It was pretty shocking. The service took so agonizingly long it was hard to enjoy the food, which was fairly good but didn't really blow our socks off. Overall, a very disappointing experience, especially since I consider Porta Bella a city landmark. I'm planning on contacting the management, which is something I've NEVER done before but I was THAT appalled by how bad our waitress was.I got a watch battery changed there about ten years ago, and service/price were fine.  However, walking down State Street today, I saw a sign saying "Your husband called...and said you can buy anything you want!  Yay!" and I will never shop there...even if this was a 'joke' or 'funny retro' it is still wildly inappropriate to suggest wives need their husbands' permission, or that a husband is needed to purchase jewelry (and no, I'm not a dried up spinster...yet).  It's 2012, Goodman's Jewelers.  Get with it.On Nov. 2, 2013, we ordered breakfast of various versions of scrambled eggs.  Oddly -- or cheaply -- Bluephies uses less-than-full-size plates, so our food covered the entire plate.  If you're looking for quantity, you'll be happy.  If you want just the average size portions, and like to mix up your scrambled eggs with some of your hash browns, these less-than-full-size-plates that it very hard to do.  Secondly, the service was not very good: I was not offered water (and I do appreciate restaurants that save water by not automatically giving it out, since not all patrons want water) and we had quite a time of it trying to flag our waitress to get some (finally got water from the bus boy).   I asked for more napkins and was given cocktail napkins rather than larger, more suited-to-the-task dining napkins.  Again, we had quite a time of it to get the attention of our waitress to ask her to exchange those puny cocktail napkins for properly-sized dining napkins.Average americanised Chinese.   My girlfriend and I have ordered take out numerous times.   This last time we both ordered the sesame chicken dinner special with an egg roll.   After about 8 hrs we both became violently ill.   I have had diagnosed food poisoning before and this was it.   My guess would be the egg rolls.   Again this was an isolated incident, but we will not be eating here again.Notice that all the 5 star ratings are older?  Something has changed with All Valley Electric.   We contacted All Valley on 11/13/2013 based on Yelp's ratings.  Tony came to the home and gave us an estimate the same day we called.  He talked a good story and was very amicable.  We authorized him to do the work the same day.  He was to arrive the following Saturday.   Won't bore you with explicit details, you have seen or heard it all before.  No shows, broken promises, hard to contact, lucky if you get a return call. Don't waste 3 months waiting on broken promises and hard luck stories.  Do yourself a favor and just bypass All Valley Electric for an estimate. You'll be glad you did.They were the only airlines that fly from PHX to Long Beach so I had to buy a ticket from US Airways.  I was so excited to go to CA for one of my BFFs wedding shower.  2 days before my flight out, I did not feel well.  I went to urgent care and found out I had bronchitis.  I called the airlines and they told me that the change fee is $150 for tickets that cost less than $140.  I mentioned to the agent that the change fee is more than my ticket, she said "OH it is cheaper for you to purchase a new ticket." and snickered.  WTF!  Really, snickering at a customer?Just flew US Airways from Charlotte to LAX (direct flight).  Was excited when I boarded the flight to find it was produced in 2012.  Once I took my seat I realized this plane had no entertainment center . . . Nothing.  One one think that when they were selecting the options of their new fleet, that an entertainment center would have been selected.Service was horrific. Don't expect courteous bar tenders. They must not be working for tips because they couldn't give an ef less about any thing other than playing their own video poker or having a smoke break. You're more of an inconvenience to them than a customer. I'm referring specifically to the older woman and her daughter. Once again, horrific service! Blatantly bad.Worst burger place ever. Felt like I was eating school cafeteria food at best. What kind of restaurant turns their shake machine off at 6 pm? Food was cold except for the zucchini which was also subpar. I would never eat at this sh**hole again. Yuck!!!The worse service.My suggestion: spend 3 or 4 quiet minutes looking around before you order. You can stand in one place. Notice the floor, the decorations, the fake plants, the ceiling. Take it all in. THEN decide if this is a place you want to eat food from. I should have taken the hint when I walked in and there were no other customers there on a Saturday during the noon hour. Unfortunately I was dead set on supporting a local rather than chain establishment that day. And with no one to slow me down, I ordered right away. Only after ordering did I take in the grimy scene. The place is disturbingly unclean looking.

The gyro was large but plain and average in flavor - a bit too greasy. Fries were overcooked, hardly any salt, and old tasting. 

The service was uninspired and actually slow despite no other customers being there. It seemed like we were a bother.

My two boys were okay later, but I had some intestinal distress during the window of time that would point to this meal.

I won't be back.BK: Are you checking up on your franchise holders? Probably the worst I've ever been to!When did Jiffy Lube become more than the dealer?   

The only good thing about these guys was the fact that they warned me about the price of an oil change for my vehicle because it requires synthetic oil.

$78. I pay 50 at the dealer. That is a 50% increase over the dealer.

Basically, they've given me a reason to never ever and I mean ever use Jiffy Lube again.

When I told him what I pay at the dealership, he just said okay, shrugged his shoulders and walked away like he could care less that he was losing the business.Did not deliver. Would not return deposit 

Paid deposit. Promised delivery came and went with no contact. Promised delivery again. Came and went with no contact. Promised to return deposit several times but did not. Filed BBB complaint. Again said would return deposit but did not. Filed ROC complaint and finally returned deposit. 7 months later.I just got off the phone with the receptionist and didn't even get past the inquiry before deciding this company was not for me.  I called to ask about their services.  She told me that the person in charge was in a meeting and she wanted to obtain some of my information.  We proceeded to go through how many bed/baths I have, square footage, number of stories in the home, kids, pets, and then she started repeating the same questions like she forgot she already asked them. I told her we already went over those questions and she continued to ask them. Obviously very disorganized and not a great first impression.  I won't trust a person who keeps saying "Duuuuh" over the phone with my house.
NO THANK YOU!!This place is a nightmare. I called 4 times to follow up on my refunds. It finally refunded me back the money after one month!
DO NOT buy from this place.Nothing but a place that steals your money.  First, it took so long for a simple order to ship/arrive that the patient died (really).  Trying to get these now-useless items returned was an email and phone nightmare.  The products were eventually picked up and, as of this date (6 months after the return), still no credit.

I used to get dozens of emails and banner ads.  After the sole my money, zip.  This simply indicates we are looking at a deliberate case of consumer fraud/theft.

Stay away!I called Central Towing last night because I had accidentally locked my keys inside my car. They said it was going to be about a 25 minute wait. After an hour I called several times... no answer. They didn't show up until an hour and a half later!TOOO Pricy!!!NOTE:  This was a 4-star review, but the food quality and ESPECIALLY customer service have gone down the tubes.  See update below.
Complaining I can't find a good meatball sub in Phoenix, I was referred to Santisi Brothers.  I was told that the meatballs are still made by the brothers' mother, so I was intrigued. 
Santisi Brothers did not disappoint.  That sub was so freaking good!!!  I got the 1/2 sandwich, which included two meatballs smothered under mozzarella and marinara on a toasted baguette-type roll.  Amazing.  The bread was soft inside with just the right crust, the meatballs were sizable (that's what she said!), and they did not scrimp on the mozzarella.  Since this is their only location in the valley, we will be sure to be back.  (It's right off I-17, close to the 101, so that's not hard.)
If you like sports, go!  This place has each wall covered in TVs - huge to 13", they don't spare a bit of viewing area.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the seating leaves a bit to be desired.  We sat at a hightop table with stools.  Next are a row of tables with nicer chairs (with backs), and the row closest to the TVs - who wants to sit there?  Music - we could hear each other, but agreed a table of four might have to shout.  Our server, Ariel, was very enjoyable, nice, and attentive.
Big beer and bar selection.  Husband's Kiltlifter was in a huge beer mug and he was happy to see a few IPAs.  I had a John Daly that was verrry tasty.  It's one of those sneaky super-yummy drinks...  Sweet iced tea, lemonade, and vodka - I'll be stealing that recipe this summer!
Husband had the turkey club, which was large enough to be funny to watch him eat, but he said it was unremarkable.  Side of fries were also really, really good.  Perfect amount of potato, crispiness, and salt.  We also had garlic knots, which are served with marinara and pretty tasty, but left me wishing there was a little ball of mozzarella in the middle.  House salads were... house salads.  Nothing special there.
To review: great for sports (I'm sure they can spare a TV for your game), may want to go early for good seats, good bar, and some great food.  EAT/DRINK:  Meatball sub, french fries, and a John Daly.  All wonderful.
PS - Kitchen is open till 11pm Sun-Thu, midnight Fri-Sat.so, as an auto owner, i've had nothing but good experiences with AAA, from Georgia to NM to California to Mass, and back home to AZ, never a problem. 

it's the travel department that nearly screwed us for our wedding. way back when, we looked into destination weddings with a AAA AZ branch. our rep always said "i'm looking into it, i'll call you tomorrow" and then a week later, i'd call to ask what the hold up was and was met by the same thing. a month passes by and we find out that rep was fired. 

so we've got plenty of time and decide to go to a different AAA AZ branch, the one on Glendale Ave. We were greeted with smiles and elations by their travel rep who said she had a great deal of experience with destination weddings and she would handle EVERYTHING to make our experience hassle free and a joy to remember. said she did the same trip (although not for a wedding) for a group of friends every year, so she "knew what she was doing". things went sour from there. 

we hardly EVER received return phone calls on time. all the guests we invited that were to book through this AAA branch never received phone calls back. so every-single-one of our guests did their own booking with the hotel and airlines....not just 1-2 guests, all of them. and when we pressed her about this, it was always "oh, my system crashed" or "oh, my phone wasn't working"....come on!

fast forward to a week before our trip departure...for our wedding and honeymoon. still no word from the AAA rep. Three days before, we FINALLY get confirmation. you want to see stressed? how about a bride and groom having to wait till the last minute to find out if all their rooms and flights were booked after paying everything up front?

but the proverbial icing on the cake? we were advised to have our invitees "donate" a wedding gift to our wedding through the AAA travel website. that way, those guest that couldn't attend could still give us something and at the end, we'd get a check. 

unfortunately, it wasn't that easy. at no point were we informed that 10% of "donations" would be kept by AAA. furthermore, my now wife has had to make numerous calls to the AAA office to actually get our wedding "donation" check. it was always "they're cutting the check today"...a week later...."they're cutting the check today", etc. 

to summarize, i'll keep my AAA for cars only. their travel department was probably one of the most unprofessional, unorganized, and untimely departments i've ever had to deal with. we would've saved ourselves a boat load of stress by doing it ourselves.Never seen such bad body work and lack of professionalism, and their mechanic is terrible. The only reason we took our car here was because of location, and have never regretted something with a vehicle so much. I would be here forever explaining the lack of work and everything else wrong with our experience here. Plan on it taking a lot longer than expected and if you're a woman that doesn't know about cars, definitely don't go here without someone who won't be bs'd. Plan on being on top of them asking questions or you won't know what's going on... no courtesy calls or updatesThis review is on one of the company drivers...For sure the customer service skills need some assistance. Their driver was behind me at a light today and because I didnt try to beat the green light for a left turn( which turns to a green arrow just following) honked repeatedly and was flipping me off...and my child was in the care with me to watch this guy yelling and flipping me the bird. And if the company reads these reviews the license plate was 059 YRJ- bald headed angry man needs a write up!Aw shit y'all done fucked up and let me in this bitch.   I hope there is some sort of Retweet-type function on Yelp and that every person that reads this RY's (Re-Yelps, hahha I fucking slay me) the fuck out of this review. I've never even patronized this place, so I'm sure true Yelpers are gonna find all sorts of wrong here, but I. don't. give. a. fuck.  

First, I have eaten at Julio's Too, but the one in Tempe on that street by the stadium, BEFORE IT WENT OUT OF BUSINESS.  While I was waiting for whatever the fuck shitty thing I ordered, I ate some of their shitty chips and salsa, and I'm not gonna spray a bunch of unnecessary expletives about it like all the sentences you've already read; it was simply terrible salsa.  I don't remember if my shitty entree was shitty or not, but I'm pretty sure it was shitty.  I never went back, and it was like two blocks from my dorm. 
So tonight, I pull into the Old Town area around 9 or so(I know, what the fuck was I doing in Old Town?!), and drive around a bit seeing if I can snag a street parking spot like I'm usually able to.  I'm no Chris Angel, David Blaine, David Copperfield, (just listed all magicians past and present that I am aware of), but most of the time I pull up right when some drunk ass is pulling out of their spot and I snag it, whilst talking shit to the person right behind me who no doubt then had to park in bumblefuck and then ride one of those pedi-cabs that always have strange motherufuggin drivers that like to talk about their collection of over 50 "My Buddy" and "Kid Sister" dolls each clothed in a time period of French History.  (the Kid Sister that lived in Versailles was kinda smokin).

But I digress.  I parked at Julio's Too at 9:00 p.m. on a Friday night in Old Town Scottsdale.  Yes, there was a sign posted in front of the spot that said: 

"Restricted Parking
Julio's Too
Vehicle Towed at Violator's Expense"

SUCK MY MOTHERFUCKING DICK.  You seriously are that full of yourself that you think your giant parking lot should be strictly reserved for patrons of your shit ass burrito joint, when you know good and well that 999 of 1000 cars that drive by your shit ass burrito joint on Friday night are full of people that are going to one of 15 places around your shit ass burrito joint that are not your shit ass burrito joint??

So you are.  And you towed my truck from your lot.  When I got back there, I understood because your lot was slammed and people were pouring into your shit ass burrito joint.  Wait, no, that doesn't seem right actually.  Now that I think of it, THERE WERE NO MOTHERFUCKING CARS IN THE ENTIRE FUCKING PARKING LOT.  Yet, you still thought it best to call the tow company, which you are clearly having sex with, to come tow my car out of the one occupied space in your entire lot.

So now, instead of enjoying my weekend being broke and staying home reading books on the first weekend of NFL football like a loser, I am going to embarrass myself by borrowing money to get my vehicle out of the impound LIKE A TOTAL FUCKING LOSER.  

Suck a dick Julio's Too.  And if you should arrive to find a brick thrown though your window with a note taped to it that reads: "FUCK YOU, YOU TOWED MY 2004 FORD F150 PICKUP THAT IS BLACK WITH TAN TRIM, AND HAS A SCRATCH ON THE FRONT RIGHT BUMPER FROM WHEN I "ACCIDENTALLY" HIT A BICYCLIST.", I can 99.999999% guarantee you that that note-brick was not tossed by my completely-content-after-writing-this-review hands.Absolute worst service I have ever experienced. They even tell you they don't serve tap water so that they can charge for bottled water. They are rude and inattentive. I  would never come back. Wish i could give less than 1 star.Old Town Tortilla Factory's patio and outdoor ambiance is beautifully romantic. On a perfect Arizona evening in the spring or fall, it's an excellent spot to enjoy the comfortable climate. One star awarded. 

But if you do anything besides sit on the patio, you will be disappointed. Four stars deducted.   

Our server took our order after we had been seated for about 10-15 minutes. Then it was like she completely forgot that she had to actually bring us our margaritas and food. Total space cadet. We asked for things, like waters, that never came. 

Call me crazy, as most people do, but I was also highly irritated by the fact that the chips and salsa here are not complimentary. That's something I expect from a Mexican dining destination. For the top shelf pricing, they could at least throw in a measly chip and salsa bowl on the house. Yeah, their tortillas with cubes of butter are supposed to replace the chips and salsa...... but tortillas and butter? Methinks not. Methinks that I'd much rather have chips and salsa!

The food is mild to bland, yet it costs a pretty peso. I ordered the "El Tesoro Del Mar" - a salad (consisting of mostly iceberg lettuce ick), spicy honey chipotle dressing (waaaaay too sugary with too little spice), pico de gallo, corn, black beans, tortilla strips and large gulf shrimp (only 4 shrimp!! and they were hardly large, more like small to medium sized!!). This disappointment of a dish cost about $15. Overrated. I can honestly say I've had a much tastier shrimp salad at Baja Fresh, for half the price and double the shrimp nonetheless. 

I tired some of the enchiladas that Matt ordered, and they tasted forgettable at best. I've had better enchilada sauce from a store bought can. And then my mother, who was in town visiting for the weekend, ordered the grilled salmon. She was so unimpressed by the meal that she didn't even finish it... and she always finishes her food. It takes a lot of skill to mess up something like a grilled salmon. 

As far as their margaritas go, they are good but with the $8.50 to $11 price tag I'm just not convinced that they are worth it. I've had better margaritas at places with better menus. I can honestly say that after eating here once, I have ZERO desire to ever go back.Went to the GAP event on Sunday and was extremely disappointed. Most of the restaurants were chains or mediocre places that weren't offering any good food. The lines were out of control and the place was so packed with people I was constantly getting bumped and having to dodge strollers and rampant kids. Even though it was only $10 to get in, the prices for food and drink were so high that we ended up spending way more than we would have if we had just gone barhopping in downtown Scottsdale... which is what we ended up doing when we left.  Ironically the best food I had there was from Los Taquitos, which isn't even in Scottsdale, it's in Ahwatukee.

Save your money.  Its not worth what you pay.Disregard this place.
Whereas  they were formerly at the forefront of culinary innovation, they have been swiftly bypassed by every other hotspot in town.
Check out: Pig and Pickle.... (These guys kill it.)Bleck! Stopped here Sunday morning for a quick breakfast. We waited about 20 minutes for 2 people (understandable its a sunday morning) but ended up waiting over 30 minutes for our food, that's 30 minutes of waiting after we ordered! There was nothing good about this breakfast at all. It took forever to get our food, when it finally came out the food was cold, everything was tasteless, the sausage was burnt, the toast was burnt, the hash browns had no taste and were completely dry, the eggs were not cooked how I asked and our waitress was in her own little world.... I know Denny's isn't a fantastic place or usually at the top of my list to eat at in the first place, but we had to pass it to go where we were going, we had not had it in quite sometime, its cheap and we thought it would be simple, easy and ok. But it wasn't even ok, it was just as I said earlier.... BLECK! I wont be going back here, I will drive further to hit up an IHOP or spend some more money and hit up a local spot!

Methinks not!I usually come here a couple of times a month and I absolutely adore this place. But today was a different story. Their Yelp indicates they are open until 3 pm. My boyfriend and I walked in the door at 1:27 and got taken to a table. We were already feeling rushed at this point. Then our food came out.... Quite fast may I add. My pancakes were outstanding, on the other hand my boyfriend's 49er flapjacks were soggy and not crispy how they should be. Again... Obviously rushed. Before we were done eating at 1:50 our rude server brought us the bill and said we needed to pay then because they were trying to finish up paperwork. Then proceeded to reach over us to clear an insignificant plate. I then attempted to inform her of the hour of operation displayed on their yelp said 3 pm and they might want to change it because we were misled and then felt rushed. She walked away from us as we tried to tell her this... Disrespect like this shouldn't have even gotten you a tip you rotten server. Great job guys  you lost loyal customers!My friend from out of town and I came here on her last night because i was recommended by an associate of mine. I was incredibly disappointed. It's a monday night, three tables in the dining room (as far as i could tell) the server never told us his name, and seemed frazzled from the get-go. That should have been our cue to leave, but we decided to stick around for a bit. The service was simply awful, and I'm pretty easy to please, as I've waited tables for over five years The food was mediocre at best, the caesar salad was probably the best thing that we ordered. 

i will not be returning.Just left the place, at home now waiting for a pizza as we left this place in disgust! Not only are we disgusted at the NASTY BUG! (see the last picture) in my friends salad but also at the attitude server Henry gave us as we pointed this out to him. He insisted in a rude manner that this was an anchovie. I'm pretty sure anchovies don't have legs and wings and look like a freaking BUG. I know he didn't want to make a scene for the parties around us, so he tried to make us look stupid. Well sorry Henry, the only stupid one here is you, especially for telling us to "just leave" after you failed to accept this mistake. That's the worst thing you can do to your costumers who have frequented this place. HORRID!

we figure this place stays busy and open because of its amazing location. that's all it has going for it.I would recommend you take your business elsewhere.

My fiance's engagement ring lost a small diamond, so I went to fast fix to see if they could fix it. I got there 10:30am, the person behind the counter couldn't even give me a quote for how much it would cost and said I needed to wait until 11am when the jeweler arrives. So I browsed the mall a little bit, came back at 11:10, still no jeweler, he was late. Finally at 11:20 he arrived, and said it would cost $100 to fix. Seemed expensive to me, but it was urgent so I agreed. I picked the ring up the next day.

Later, it lost another stone in a different place. This time I thought I would try a local jeweler instead and was amazed at the difference! The jeweler fixed the ring for $25, and I was in and out of the store, with the ring fixed, within 8 minutes, no joke. I felt so ripped off by fast fix that I decided to write this review.

I will never go back to fast fix, they are way more expensive, and slower, than other jewelers. A better name for this business would be Slow Expensive Fix Whose Jeweler Shows Up 20 Minutes Late.Why do stores like this exist? Does anyone in Arizona really need more brightly colored, tacky tchotchkes? It looks like Elton John threw up in here and then Liberace tried to cover it up by bedazzling everything.After 14 years as a faithful Jiffy Lube customer...This shop has done me in.

First time I visited---and knew what to expect (some upsell)....which is fine....

But, No means No....after 4 times....what don't you understand?

Sad that there is no local contact to express my concerns....VW has big ambitions for America. They want to significantly increase sales and produce the best mass-produced cars on American roads. Some have said they want to become the next Toyota (though that ambition now seems less austere). 

The reality is, however, that they have no chance of doing that if people receive the kind of poor service that my girlfriend received from the Chapman VW service department last November.

In short, there was a transmission problem and though this should have been covered under a VW 10yr/100K powertrain warranty for her 2000 Beetle, the dealership would not honor this, and instead claiming that the issue was not covered.

In the end, the dealership charged her $568.07 for a fix that took nearly two business weeks to complete, during which time my girlfriend was without car. All the while, the service advisor, Kevin Fore treated my girlfriend with the kind of contempt and disregard that should have gone out with the age of feminism. To top it off, the mechanics left grease on the yellow interior paintwork. Classy.

So in short, shitty customer service + poor service time + $120/hr labor= recipe for disaster. VW would best be served to cease business with this dealer immediately. Run, don't walk VW!Maybe they make good sandwiches but if you order something harder than that you might NOT get something OK to eat .

Not only did I wait 1/2 hour to get my salad after I ordered it but when it arrivered it was awful and mostly not edible.

I ordered the chicken pesto salad and it was smeared maybe bottleld pesto paste smeared sickenly thick on top of breaded chicken breast ....(AWFUL)

the salad could have been great but it wasn't because it was soaked in a fishy Oil that tasted like oil from anchovies it was a bowl of salad drowning in what tasted like oil from anchovies and covered with lots of grated cheese to make the fishy oil all over taste even worse .

Also a big splash of tomato sauce on my salad plate .

This salad was insaulting and disrespectal to anyone .

This truley was one of the worst meals I ever tried to eat .

I left my salad in full display of guest to see

I didn't even complain because I didn't trust them to make me anythingelse and I didn't want to wait another half hour .

I think even a teen at a drive threw would care and make better food I can never try this place again....no care here....I can't eat at a place that is this way .What a disappointment yesterday. We wanted to have a late dinner and drinks after the football game and that wasn't possible at the Tempe z-Tejas. I love the location in Scottsdale so we thought this would be a solid spot to patronize. 

We were seated in the corner like they didn't want us there. But this allowed for us to watch the timeline and activities in the area. They started filling in the tables and actually moved other patrons after they had been seated so they could accommodate another table?? Those folks were more polite, I felt this inconsiderate to their experience. On the subject of other patrons another table did better by getting their drinks from the bar. Our server was too busy standing at the server station, "looking busy". He wasn't, trust me, I was a server for years. Not a good habit when the computer is in guest view. 

The female server in the area was on top of things and folks who were sat after us had drinks, cornbread and soup. We had asked for lemons twice to no avail, because our server never came back to our table by that time. The one thing we managed to receive was the "hard day" margaritas. These were over poured with alcohol and didn't taste good. 

It came down to the unfortunate situation of snagging a manager from a runner. I informed him of the deplorable service and he offered to be our server. It was so long at that point I couldn't stay. It was insulting. The manager comp'd our drinks and said we were are free to go. Like we were being removed from prison. At this point I was so irritated I would have preferred a more professional phrase, such as I'm sorry for the poor service, etc. The server never introduced himself, never even looked us in the eye or took care of us and his other tables in the slightest. Here is your tip: do not work in a college town at a place where people will come late at night if you can't be polite. It's part of the job. Maybe find a job where you don't serve people because you are not good at that.I never want to go to this hospital again. Worst experience ever. I was stuck there for five days and all they did was make up more excuses to keep me there. Did every test imaginable and yet left sick and had to go to another hospital. I told them over and over the antibitocs was making me sick. They ignored me and came to find out I was allergic to it. They also have horrible TV service, wtf? The employees also were nice but they were to open in complaining on how they have budget cuts there. I am a patient, I dont want to hear how cheap they are. lol.
The food was the most disgusting food ever, I thought I was eating dog food. 
Go to another hospital if you can. This is a horrible one. I cringe just thinking about it.If I were to rate *only* the food then I would have given a 5-star rating since I find the food really good. But its not only the food that makes you come back or appreciate a place.

The service of this place is very poor. I believe the servers should be given some training on how to interact with guests, how to behave with them, how to serve them. But no, the owner doesn't care about it. It happens with me all the time, the servers "hands-me" the plates, bowls, curries, breads everytime without fail, insteading of keeping it on the table even when I am in the middle of my meal. 

And the most irritating thing, they always ask you to pay while you are eating. ALWAYS! Why can't they wait for me to finish and then let me ask for the cheque or if it can't be avoided, why can't they be courteous while asking for it. Last time when I went there, the same thing happened and instead of complying, I complained, asked the server that I wanted to speak to the manager. This really spoils *the* experience for me.

I keep going back to this place since it is walking distance from my place, but after the last time, never going back!DO NOT I repeat DO NOT go to this location! I usually go to the one on frank Lloyd wright because that's right around where I work,but I live near this one so I thought I'd try it out. First off the aesthetics of this one are quite displeasing and unfriendly. The retail here is a better selection but I would buy my lotions online if I were you. I got a mystic tan for the first time and it turned out a nightmare!! It was extremely streaky and a bit orange-y. It felt as if the machine was only spraying one side of me and sure enough it looks that way too. I also had to blot dry a couple of areas because it didn't dry while in the machine. Needless to say I'll be going back to versa. I definitely feel like the staff was unfriendly and like I was waisting their time just by being there. If I could give them 0 stars I would...They messed up my bacon egg cheese bagel and gave me a sausage egg and cheese bagel. They flipped the cooked egg in the plastic container on to the plastic table the place where all the other food Is prepared. That added a Some new taste.This location definitely needs a renovation. Mens locker room smells like human waste and BO, and the late night cleaning crews give off a creepy vibe every time. Treadmills are broken and in need of repair, and AC isn't always working. Get your act together 24 hour fitness!the best cat food in tempe!   i wish they would respect our privacy and right to 

not have them solicit our complex with taping ther adverts throughout our complex against our rules....This is by far the worst Chinese buffet/place that sells food that I have ever eaten in my whole life.  It does not even deserve the one star. 

I went there one day hungry with a friend and wanted to try this place out. I don't know why they are still open there was like a few other people. The food was VERY greasy, they didn't regularily change the food on the buffet and some of the food had turned cold. The place was mess. I literally took 2 bites and paid and left. 

I'll never go there again even if you paid me. Save yourself the money and go somewhere else.Has got to be the worse mcdonalds I have ever been too. I thought all the other reviews were just being mean, but they're right. I walked in at 1:20pm on a Thursday. There was one family waiting for ice cream cones but other than that, no one else was in line or near the counter. I watched as the cashier got the ice cream cones made and handed to the kids and even when she looked at me and I smiled at her, she still did not return the smile or greet me. There was another worker bagging drive thru food and another employee sweeping the floor. All of them looked directly at me. Not one of them greeted. 
I waited for 10 minutes WITH NO ONE ELSE IN LINE before I finally was asked what I wanted. They were all talking to each other and joking around with the cooks about nonsense. 
I finally got my drink, the soda was flat, and when I got my food, the buns were stale and the fried were old and cold. 
The seats were falling apart. The booth I sat in moved every time the teen on the other side of it moved. They then made it a game and continued to move it and laugh about it with their friends. One woman sat in another booth next to mine and the seat nearly collapsed to the ground because of how unstable it was. 
I was just looking for cheap dollar menu before work but this wasn't even worth the dollar.I usually take my pets to an old fashioned small family owned private practice. My older pet (11 years old) has been experiencing some problems so I called to make an appt. I needed to get in fairly quick. I spoke with Rebecca, who was very pleasant and stated she could be seen the very next morning.
I arrived at 8:30am, and checked-in. My appt time was at 8:40am, I was kept waiting until 9:10am before I was brought into a room. There are 6 rooms total from what I could see, there were TONS of vet techs walking around and they just seemed "too busy" to truly connect with me or my pet.

A vet tech came in to go over my concerns, it was brief, maybe 7 minutes maximum. Then the vet came in, she was very nice and courteous with my pet. She did a quick evaluation, again maybe 7 minutes maximum. About 5 minutes later the vet tech came back in with an estimate of $740 for blood work and xrays. 

I am happy to pay for my pets needs, as she is my family and she deserves the best. I unwillingly decided I would leave my pet there for testing. I returned later that day and was shown an xray of my dogs abdomen. I was told she could under-go an exploratory surgery to find out truly what the problem was, which she is old and I would never do that to her unless there is truly a purpose. I am not ok to surgically open up my elder dog for you to explore. No thanks.

I was told her spleen and/or liver could be problematic causing her symptoms. When I went to pick up my pet, all the staff told me how cooperative and sweet my pet was. And even allowed them to take samples (poking her with a needle without being numbed) with no response, just tried to bury her head next to them. 

I was told to wait for the lab work to come back before making any decisions, which at this point. They hadn't even given me a prognosis or any indication of what could be causing this swelling in her tummy. I paid $800 for blood work, a cytology test, 1 xray of her abdomen and 20 pills of medication. (Just to give you an idea of their pricing)

I was given a call today (one day later) and the person who called to check up called my pet by the wrong name. And then said we don't have the results yet, just wanted to check in on her. Nice gesture, but perhaps getting the name right & true genuine feeling behind your voice would be nice during this trauma.

Overall, they are generally nice but I will not continue to utilize this place for my pet  they currently saw, or my other pet. I prefer a place with more connection, genuine care, and heart-warming understanding that pets are not just pets but family.....at least to me. That is the reason for the low star review...strictly based on if I would take my pet back or recommend to others, and No..I would not.Nice people...bad food. We went for breakfast and got some things to share. Bacon, eggs and pancakes were way overcooked. Our 3 year old had biscuits and gravy which was pretty bland, even she dumped salt and ketchup all over it. Definitely did not hit the spot which sucks cause we were really in a b-fast mood and starving.I don't like to trash restaurants either but 2 times here was two times too many.  Dinner was forgettable at best (a plastic container with canned fruit cocktail?really?).  Breakfast was ever worse! Have they heard of HOT coffee? How many times do you have to ask for cream? When you order a bacon & cheese omelet, who the heck just lays 2 pieces of whole bacon in the omelet & just folds it over AND then doesn't bother to finish cooking the omelet?  Greasy overcooked hashbrowns, toast drowning in butter & that godawful fruit cocktail again. This place is a heartattack on a plate.  Service is HORRID! The over 75 crowd that frequents this place has obviously decided they don't deserve good, fresh & tasty food and has just given in to CHEAP.  How does a place like this stay in business?If you're ever shot in the parking lot of St. Rose Dominican, insist that the ambulance driver take you to a different hospital.

But if you want to be cared for by nurses who will forget to give you painkillers when you come out from under anesthesia after major surgery, and will expose you to infection by sending you home with a bag of drained blood dangling from the site of said surgery, then by all means, enjoy your stay.

I don't know if a language barrier contributes to the stunningly poor care from the nurses at St. Rose Dominican, but it's there.

What I witnessed here was an absolute nightmare.this place is a joke... I came in and ordered 2 smoothies and they made me wait 25 minutes for 2 drinks... they gave us a straw that had sticky substance on it... WTF. it was expensive for no reason and the smoothies weren't even tasty. NEVER COMING BACK.I ordered the french onion soup, 12oz strip steak med-rare with mushrooms/onions and extra broccoli.

The steak was almost flavorless, the broccoli was waaay overcooked and yet somehow served cold, and the french onion soup tasted like beef bullion with extra salt.

I had a 25$ giftcard so I paid $1.62 and I still feel ripped off.

When my son brings home those flyers from school where applebees donates a percentage of your bill to the school... I'm going to give his teacher 10$ and stay home for dinner.I wonder if anybody has decided to not go to vegas because of the reviews of McCarran Airport...."3 star avg? hell no, I'm going to fly to Midway International Airport instead."

It smells in here. A lot of drunk people who are either:

a) at the end of a weekend bender
b) just getting to vegas, took a ton of shots before boarding their plane, and got hit with drunkness on their flight over

Also, I hate the slot machines. The last thing I need while waiting for my delayed flight is to hear the bells, stupid music, and coins-falling-into-a-bin sound effect. 

If you're lucky you can catch a glimpse of a celebrity as they are en route to their limo. I didnt see one but I did see Paris Hilton's limo driver. I was star struck and offered my body. The limo driver turned me down. Blast.Wow not sure who the owner is, but this was the worse experience EVER! We were waiting for our pizza and the guy yelled at us and ask why we were waiting against the wall. The place was packed with no where to sit, where are we suppose to wait. We paid for our pizza and giving you out business. Never coming back here again.The 11.99 steak and lobster is a great price... Service horrible and management is not real management. Would not do seperate checks..got the bill and it was not itemized the fountain drinks and alcohol all together in one..we had a party of about 20,everybody had different drinks of course, I will never eat at any tony romas again..This place is a dump. 90 percent is filled with shirts, mugs, and other pawn stars  merchandise. Had to wait in line outside for about 10 minutes. Went inside and the little things that they were selling were all complete ripoffs. Nothing in this store would be of any value whatsoever unless you like paying at least 5 times what the item is worth. YOu won't see anybody on the show here either. Summary
-Ripoff and WAY overpriced
-Won't see tv strs here
-Place is a dump
-Bad locationThe only reason people visit this place is because of the tv show. If it weren't for the tv show this place would be like any other pawn shop. If you think you're going to go to vegas and meet the cast you are highly mistaken. Since they're paid celebrities now there is no need for them to be there. The pawn shop itself is nothing grand either. The only disappointment of going to Las VegasThe absolute worst food in Vegas in my opinion.  We got our food to go, had the Irish Stew and it was nasty, I was only able to take two bites before having to give up.  Extremely strong after taste left in the mouth even now an hour after taking those two bites. Never again will I visit this establishment for food or anything else for that matter.  If I could give it 0 stars I would.Terrible all around! We had the pizza with artichokes, chicken, basil & tomatos. It was horrible! Not only did the pizza have the soggiest crust possible, but the chicken had absolutely no flavor. The service was fine and they kept the drinks filled. I will never go to metro pizza again. Usually when you have terrible food there is a positive, but this place had no positive. I don't know what was worse the food or the decor. Ick!Well, I couldn't even shop yet because prior to shopping, I called to see if they had the grocery items I needed.

I asked the lady on the phone if they had any chili peppers besides jalepenos. She said hold on and that she'll redirect me.

...I have been "redirected" for over 15 minute now, and have yet to hear a sound over the phone. If I can't even confirm what they have, why should I shop there?This place sucks! We showed up and were told the wait would be an hour and a half. Since there were 20 of us, we were told we could return in 2.5 hours and race. Guaranteed! We found the nearest bar and upon return, we're told it would be another 1.5 hour wait. Lame! So we left and they lost out on $1000!  The girl at the desk sucks on getting and keeping business for this place! Make sure you have reservations and still plan on waiting 2 hours!Sal si puedes. 

From a business trip perspective, this place was major fail.

I was here for a conference, related to internet commerce. Hey, guess what didn't work? Give up? 'K, I'll tell you.  Internet. 

The people at the check-in counter were happy to announce that the hotel had recently upgraded to wifi. Recently? This should have been done a long time ago, not last week. See my last review from two years ago, regarding no internet.

If it wants to host conferences, the Rio needs to be able to support the conference's needs.  I was refunded the $14/day internet access fee, as were most other conference-goers who complained I'm sure, but it cost the guests much more than that. It cost them their business, as virtual meetings and skype calls, and even simple activities like checking email, could not be done. 

And for $200/night to stay there? No. 

There remain two redeeming features of the Rio.

* Gaylord's Indian restaurant. Completely decent Indian food at completely decent prices, in a well-appointed space. Totally overlooked and underappreciated by most Rio guests as they surge  frantically towards the All-Murkin bar and grill.  And because so few people dine there, they don't have the staff to handle moderate traffic from the all-murkin bar and grill spillover at lunchtime. Poor guys. I say to them: Sal Si Puedes.

* The second feature is the free shuttle, because it takes you *away* from the Rio. SAL SI PUEDES!Been here a few times for oil changes and the service seems to get worse and worse now. I keep going because they are fairly quick and inexpensive. Today when my car is done the guy comes over and the first thing he says is... "no more 9.99 oil changes next month." Ok? Thanks? I think? He told it to me like he was accusing me of abusing the system or something. Stop sending hundreds of coupons advertising cheap oil changes if you are upset about it. So that ticked me off, then he goes to the car with me and tells me I should get the air filter replaced soon. I was pretty sure they replaced it last time so I mentioned that to him and he just said "oh, ok" then he angrily asked the girl at the counter when we went up to cash out how come my replaced air filter wasn't on my paperwork from last time. So... it didn't need to be replaced is what you are telling me. Because if it was on my paperwork from last time it clearly wouldn't have needed to be replaced and you probably would have tried to find some other bullsh*t thing to add to my bill. 

Urgh... auto shops are so shady and the ones that aren't charge way too much. I may have to start paying more to receive an honest service. How sad is that?

Oh and when driving away I realized that they didn't replace my sticker letting me know when I need to return for service. They lost a customer today. I've been putting up with their crap for a while because it was convenient and cheap.Man, these guys are lucky there isn't a 0-star option. Or negatives, even. 

I came here earlier today (7/17/2011) because I thought my car battery was dying, and I wanted to replace it. Easy enough, right? No. Allow me to tell you why I'm so unhappy. 

I parked right outside their service bays because I thought it'd be easier for them to help me. When I walked in the place and asked the guy for help, he asked me to pull right up to the first bay. So I did. Then I asked me to pull away and closer to the third or fourth bay. So I did. Then they asked me to pull into the first bay again. So I did. Then they asked me to back up again, and then they asked me to park near the bays (where I was in the first place!) while someone got to me. It was insane, man. 

Plus, when I spoke to one of the guys there, he said "I hope we get a chance to help you before we close. We close at 6." Well, yes, I hope so too, as it's 5.05pm. Jerks.

I waited in my car until 6:10 pm, when I finally got frustrated and drove away. I will be sending my complaints to someone there to see what they have to say. Also, for the record, I've been coming to this store since 2004. I've never had this kind of problem. It's the kind of the thing that really, really pushes me into becoming an AutoZone person going forward.Great location on the strip, but this place is otherwise pathetic. It's dirty and seems to have fallen into general disrepair. Half the elevators work, half of them do not. There is no wireless internet, and corded access required one hour and 20 minutes on the phone with technical support in order to get the Internet to work. I cannot wait to check out of this place. And I do not ever plan to come back here. So many better options on the Strip.Service was terrible. Our server was completely inept, requiring constant reminders for the simplest of requests (e.g., a glass). The food was borderline at best - bland and unremarkable. Overall, the experience will not be bringing us back.POOR SERVICE: It took a very long time for the waiter to greet us and get drink orders. We received silverware that was not cleaned. Once we ordered our food the waiter never once came to ask us if we needed anything. We ate out entire meal without any refills of our beverages. When we discussed our concerns with the manager, his only response was sorry.If I could give this place no stars I would. Negative stars even.  Its a stink hole.
The service is not friendly at all. First of all its not a "hotel", its a MOTEL. We checked in and they gave us a room on the ground floor. I asked if they could put us on the second or third floor so the bums and crack whores didn't try to rob our room while we were out having fun in town.  So they gave us a room on the second floor which was a cute room at first. The bathroom door handle was broken so we called the front desk and they said maintenance would come fix it. No one ever came.  The light switch in the bathroom was also broken and no one came to fix that either. I fixed the door handle myself with my nail kit. My daughter had a buttom fall off her shirt and asked for a sewing kit, they said house cleaning would bring it, no one ever came.  At 12 midnight, a group of hispanic people decided it was a good idea to have a raging party in the room above us. I called the wonderful front desk again and told them what was going on, so they said security would be right there. Guess what.....No one ever came. I called again at 5:30 am because the party was still going on loud and clear. The woman who answered the phone at the front desk was less than helpful. I said no one ever showed up to quiet the party going on above us, and she said "Well they won't be coming to YOUR room", so I said, "I know that, no one ever showed up at THEIR room, not ours". And she hung up on me. Thank god for the effects of alcohol becuase I think they finally passed out. None the less we got no sleep and had to function that way at our daughters graduation from UNLV. A 4 hour grad cermony on no sleep is not fun. The Wi Fi never worked for us. We called again to see if we needed a code to get it and they told us that to many people in the surrounding area steal the wi fi so it was not available for us to use with our phones. The air conditioning was funky. You have to put your room card in a slot in the wall and then adjust the temp by the thermostat in the middle of the room and it never stayed on. It was a sweat box the first night (along with the party) I would not recommend this MOTEL to anyone and I've already told my entire family and friends never to stay there or in that area if they visit Vegas.I've been to Macy's before. Great store; for some reason this particular store was full of ignorant people that had no idea what they were talking about. I bought a very nice $100 dress shirt and a $50 gift card, they were in a Macy's bag, I turned around a couple of times looking at things and next thing I know my bag was gone. I realize this was partially my fault for not watching it more carefully. My fiancé and I asked around - maybe it was in the lost and found? 2 people didn't even know they had a lost and found, 2 more ladies called down there and they said they would call back. After 30 minutes of waiting for them to call back, a lady took us to security who told us to go to lost and found. We went to lost and found and they took us to another lady and told them to call down. After being there for an hour and fifteen minutes a man came up and said, "if they haven't called back by now, we probably don't have it." Probably? Well you could've told us that before we wasted an hour of our lives. We left empty handed, and won't shop at that store again.Two years ago I introduced my sister to S-a-F. We played $1 or $2 blackjack for hours, because that's how long it took the 80 year old dealer to get through one deck, lol. The pit boss came over and she had to be 90. We had a good laugh there. There's no ambience but if you like to play for cheap, it was one of the only choices remaining on the Strip.

I went back last year and, sadly, all the tables had been replaced by machines. It was early in the day, before the food vendors opened, and there was literally not a soul in the place besides me. No drink service, no cashier, no management. If you have a problem as I did, or need change or anything, you have to go out to Circus Circus, and their managers don't know anything about Slots a Fun's machines. It was a sad state of affairs and unless they turn things around, it looks like Slots a Fun's days are numbered.Our room was outdated at least 20 years. All the carpets throughout the halls were terribly stained. Our tv did not work, nor did our phone. Could not call for room service. Had to call out to some nasty Italian food place. Couldn't even sign in to their promised wifi. No one seemed to care!!! Oh yea, plus a resort fee of $15.00 per day! And tax on top of that!!!???!!!  This place is far from a resort. The pool needs to be dug up and resized to accommodate the amount of people and hotel size ratio! I had really looked forward to this little get away, kick back and get a tan. So much for that, very non-appealing....no space! This place is a dive!!!official update.

my friend got bed bug bites all over her cheeks and neck on the right side of her body.  We are officially making a complaint.  Its very upsetting and were taking this to corporate.

Have not heard anything from Travelodge yet. -__-.UGHHHHHHHH!  Why did I come here when I could have gone to in-n-out?  NEVER AGAIN!

We ordered 6 burgers and everybody added extra things such as eggs, cheese, bacon etc (all for 99 cents each!) on their burger.  We waited for what seem like ages.  Walked our drunk butts back to the hotel ready to get our grub on...

Guess what?  We all didn't have any of the extras included in our burgers.  Not only that meat was dry with no sort of flavor at all.  Even though I was starving I only managed a couple bites before giving up.  What a waste!! The price of my burger was $4.99, for that much I could have gotten a #2 animal style at in-n-out.All M&M at VERY high prices -  go online and save the visit.I have never seen the movie, and thanks to this "Bar", I never plan too. Got dragged here by a friend who always wanted to check it out. I figured since we were in Vegas, why not. Should of said Hell No instead. I got the idea that it does involve sexy bartenders dancing on top of tables, but I didn't realize that I would end up in a crowded assed bar that would make a Fire Marshall hang himself in shame. There was a line to enter but it mostly looked like convention goers from the Minnesota dressed in their best polos and pleated khakis trying to soak in the Vegas experience. Luckily for me, the bouncer accidently stamped me thus allowing me to enter for free. My friends on the other hand had to pay 10 bucks each. We got a few drinks, barely struggled to move and decided to bounce. Your better off at a Vegas Strip club folks.Unfortunately Postrio has taken a turn for the worse. We ordered a tuna tartare appetizer which was decent. 

My girlfriends gnocchi was decent but the lobster in my lobster club was rotten. My girlfriend needed to pick up some immodium after our visit and almost vomited while in the restaurant. Postrio is down for the count!! What happened!? This used to be a regular stop for us. NO MORE!!1 star is an overstatement. I wish yelp had 0 stars because that's all this place deserves. this place is far from being a resort. It looks like an old apartment complex with weird rooms. the first room we were in had a broken sofa bed, the next room had the loudest AC ever. The next one looked ok but when we took a shower, the drain was clogged. Ugh!!! in the midst of the numerous room changes, the girl in the front desk had the nerve to tell us that they should charge us for the 3rd person in the room when we specifically told them there were 3 of us during check-in. The only good thing is that some of staff (the housekeeping and the front desk manager) were apologetic for the inconvenience. please, stay away from this hotel/motel. if you are inclined to stay here because of the price, i recommend staying downtown, like the golden nugget, where it's a couple dollars more but at least it's a hotel.My husband and I frequent the one in NYC on 7th and it is wonderful.  This franchise in Caesars was absolutely HORRIBLE.  I ordered the Corned Beef Hash and it looked like a rat had taken a dump on my plate.  We took a picture of it and took it to NY and they were quite disguested at how someone could allow this to be served.  The wait staff was less than accomodating (we had heard from the area shops was normal) so we just left.  No tip, nothing.  Will never dine here again.   THEIR NICKNAME WAS  "THE RAT DELI".  Thank goodness they were closed down.Beer was good ....  that's about it.   
We went during happy hour , to try out their own beer brews and have a little food.  My wife and i were looking for new and were HOPING this place would be good.   We were unhappy. 

We got the chips and salsa , it came with some sort of cheese sauce.  Kinda tasted like that stuff you get in a glass jar ( tostitos ? ) from the grocery store. 

I ordered a steak sandwich with onion rings.  I think i got 5 onion rings ... not worth the upcharge , the steak sandwich was good however , it was literally a whole steak thrown on a peice of bread .....  Anytime i have ever had a steak sandwhich before .. they usually slice it at least.   

My wife ordered a ruben ... the waitress brought out my sandwhich and basically told us my wife would have to wait for hers since another waitress took her food on accident . ...  dont they put tickets next to the food for this exact reason ?  It took nearly another 15 minutes. By the time she got her food , mine was almost cold as i didnt want to eat and make my wife sit there while i was eating. 

We did get an apology out of the waitress , but thats it.   I dont think i expect free food or discounts for everything , but there are certain things that you would want to take care of your customers with , and this was it. 

Im sorry but first impression like this is hard to break .. will not be back.This place is a joke. The doors open at 7:30am because the primary care office also opens at 7:30am which is attached to the Quick Care. The Quick Care opens at 8am. Now, the receptionists at the front desk are extremely rude!!! They open at 8am they all come rushing in at 8:01am and it takes them 15 minutes to bring up their system. Oh and while they're sitting there they gossip about doing each others work and blah blah 

This place is a joke. When you walk in the very far woman who sits on the right, furthest away from the front doors is completely rude.

If you absolutely have to go here, i'd at least avoid her.Customer Service = None
Most of the reviews on yelp seems to be by their own staff members. Obviously, if you been in this store dress is regular clothes and not a cyclist, they tend to ignore you. Seriously, go there to be ignore, while you check out bicycles that are over $1000. What is the difference between them, no idea. No one will help you in the store. The only person that talk to me was another customer, that they ignored. Hope this place shut down, what a horrible place.This Petsmart is horrible. A few months ago, I was in the area and stopped by to pick up some cat food. It wasn't in stock. So I figured since I was already there, I'll buy more dog treats. But guess what? Those were not in stock either! I ended up driving to the Petsmart on Fort Apache & Tropicana, which is the location that I usually go to. They had everything I needed on their shelves!

About a month later, I was in the area doing errands and needed to buy cat food again (I have 3 cats). I thought, Ok, maybe in the past I just happened to stop by on a bad day. Maybe they didn't have enough employees working to restock the shelves. Walked in, stopped by the cat food and dog treat sections and again, NOTHING! Seriously, WTF? An employee approached me while i was in the cat food aisle. I pointed and asked if they had the food I wanted in stock and she said "What we have out is all we have. But you can check back later in the week." Gee, thanks lady. Headed to my usual Petsmart and found everything I needed. 

Soooo how is it that other locations have things in stock but this place doesn't? Don't waste your time here folks, you will be disappointed!This place got my business based on the location and previous review. I took my black leather boots in to be polished up. Having never received this service before myself, I was unaware of how they should turn out. I thought $10 was a fair deal since they are tall boots. No same day service so I return in a day to retrieve them to find them looking exactly as I has dropped them off. The lady assured me that the kind of leather it was made it not look smoother but they literately looked as if they were untouched altogether. Like they put them in the back and then brought them right back to me. They are not smooth, not shiny, even a little dirty still. There is no residue from polish, no clean feel, and there are still scuff marks all over them. Like I said, I don't have any polishing experience but I honestly don't believe they were taken care of at all. I am very dissatisfied.Ordered 2 salads and a chips and salsa. Got no salad dressing and no salsa. It was 6min before they were closing. i love chipotle this is the first time ive had a problem like this. im sure its just the location, they need to up there standards and keep this kind of stuff stocked. cant eat a salad with no salad dressing.First of all, MANNY I HOPE YOU ARE READING THIS. My 1991 Toyota 4runner broke down right out in front of Caesar's Palace. The tow truck driver told us that the shop we had requested was closed (of course) and offered to take us to the closest service shop. Hmm what a surprise that this tow truck driver and Manuel happen to be friends and are working together to lure helpless victims into spending hundreds of dollars at Manny's shop. When we arrived the tow truck driver jokingly said to Manny "Fuel Pump" and they both laughed. Mechanics usually charge an arm and a leg to replace fuel pumps, even though it may not be the problem. Anyways, it was about an hour before Manuel even began looking at the vehicle. I had read on some Toyota forums about this specific problem that I had been having and I tried showing Manuel but he didn't want to hear anything that I was saying. The people on these Toyota forums know what they are talking about, more than a sleazy mechanic off the Vegas strip who vaguely knows what he is doing. He told me had half a million dollars worth of tools and computers to diagnose the problem....I just accepted this because I needed my truck fixed and needed to get home ASAP. Waited around about another hour while Manuel "Diagnosed" the problem, which entailed putting a voltage meter into my fuse box and letting the engine run while he tinkered around the shop. Suddenly he starts closing the garage doors and packing up as if he were heading home. I went in to ask him what was going on with it and he told me that he would have to keep diagnosing the problem tomorrow and could have it ready by noon. We had already let him know that we don't live in Vegas and are college students and don't have the means to pay for a hotel and a possibly pricey repair. Of course when I asked him what the price would be he wouldn't tell me, and said I can tell you tomorrow. NOT SCAMMY AT ALL! Totally trustworthy. He continued to lock up the shop but we needed the truck because we needed to get home. This diagnosis could have been done way faster if he hadn't been lazy and just sitting in the shop. After requesting to get the truck back because we were going to leave, he became very agitated and said that he would have to charge $85 to put everything "back in", as if he had taken so much apart. $85 is actually a lot less than what I was expecting from this farce of a mechanic. He didn't help us at all with what we needed, and told us that if we drove it, it was going to break down again. I have news for you Manny, the truck drove without a hitch all the way back to St. George Utah. Manny is a liar and works slow. He acts nice but gets angry the minute things don't go his way. I am warning you now, if you go to Vegas and get stuck somewhere and you are picked up by ABC Towing Company, you are going to be brought to Manuel's shop. Do everything in your power to avoid this shop, or you WILL be scammed by Manuel. . $85 dollars for nothing, I thank the Lord every day that this scumbag didn't charge us more.Horrible customer service. Wouldn't return an item 2 minutes after it was purchased. Was sold an incorrect replacement piece, then told all sales were final when I walked back in from the parking lot. I hope this $50 mistake helps someone else.I've eaten at the Capriottis at the Sante Fe Station Casino a few times. A few months back, when ordering a turkey sandwich, not the sub, but the sandwich, I was delighted by a real deli sized meal. Last week, when I ordered a tuna sandwich it was more like a bread and tomato sandwich with maybe 2 oz. of tuna. It was pathetic. It was like a "tuna spray" for flavoring. So last night I ordered the turkey - and again, same lousy experience. It was as if someone sprinkled turkey like a pizza topping on it. Maybe 2 oz on the entire sandwich. I had to scrape it off the huge roll so I could taste it at all. Bad experience again. No more Capriottis for me - there's too much excellent competition out there with Firehouse subs and others.Went in for a mani pedi. Pedi was okay until I got home and the polish wiped off. I got a mani too so it shouldn't have been wet. It was an hour after the polish was on. My ankles got scrapped up too. The mani was okay but the Polish wasn't put on evenly and I had to file the extra off when I got home. Definitely won't be going back.I should have listened to the reviews. It had so many one star reviews I figured I just HAD to try it, you know? No place can still be in business after so many shitty reviews, right?

It's horrible. Horrible. Seriously, this was terrible.DON'T RENT A CAR HERE! This place is a rip off and should have a class action suit filed against it.  We reserved an economy car days in advance and when we went to get our car, all they had were the big gas guzzlers, so we had to take one of them. I won't even get into the bullshit we had to put up with at the counter as the clerk repeatedly tried to sell us overinflated insurance that we didn't want. We had rented the car for two days, and after the first day decided we would like to have it for another two days. Thrifty said that was fine and that sounded good to us. We dropped the car off at the end of our trip and headed to the airport. After arriving home, we checked our credit card bill on line and found out that Thrifty had charged us $361.00 for four days. Our original agreement for two days was $137.00. WTF? Weekend rates are quoted as almost half of weekday rates. Our additional days were weekend days. Not only did they not give us the weekend rate but they charged us far more than we originally agreed to. We tried to settle this on the phone with Thrifty and got nowhere. All the A-Hole on the phone would say is that we should have read the fine print. Well, F him and Thrifty Car Rentals. Don't EVER think you're going to save money by renting here. We'll now dispute the charge with our credit card company.I don't like waiting. My appointment was at 6.  and I waited 30 min. When she did come out she was in conversation with another client and made me wait longer. I ended up leaving and she didn't even apologize. Don't know where all the good reviews are coming from!!!If they are going to let teenagers run the place at night, they need to teach them work ethics!  We were greeted when we walked in by one worker, very pleasant.  I made my order, and she wasn't sure how it was made, so I guided her the best I could.  But after we ordered, they forgot to give us half our order, and was extremely disrespectful and rude about it.  It's ok to make a mistake, but have some accountability and passion for your job.  

I might give this place another chance.  Not sure.Good food but this place needs to be boycotted. The Roach infestation is way out of hand. I went in today as my sick uncle can only seem to keep down the wonton. I ordered by phone so I could get out quickly. 

There were no less than 200 roaches. Live and dead. Counter. Walls. Floors. Moving. Not moving. It was like being in a Roach snow globe. I asked them twice what the deal was and they just had the "I no understand" face. Purely disgusting. I had to find a clean place to put the bag. 

Please let them know this in unacceptable. I've been going there for years and this is madness.Lunch AYCE $25 45 min
Dinner AYCE 27 1 hour
Service was slow and waitress was not friendly until she brought the bill.  
We are sushi addicts and we walked out after $27. 00 all you can eat still hungry. The fish looked and tasted old and the eel was burnt/crispy and dry.  Tasted as if the only seasoning they had to use was soy and mayo, very salty.I called this place to get some information. Man too bad I missed the girls name. But she was the rudest I've ever encountered. She read her greeting super fast and before I could respond after her long greeting she goes "HELLO?!?!?!?! ::hangs up::" I didn't even have a chance to talk. That's a GREAT first impression to set for customers. This happened on Sat March 16 at 6:55pm. So I hope you guys figure out who she is and retrain her or put her in another position where she doesn't have to deal with customers.No tellers. Really. Hire hire hire. Today 2 tellers. Yesterday At 4pm 1 teller. This bank really sucks. They have a greeter and plenty of personnel to open accounts and do loans. But no tellers. Really!Horrible new patient visit! Just recently changed insurance provider and was looking for a new pediatrician for my children, called this practice for an appointment so far good, showed up to my appointment and signed in and that was it! Sat there for 50 minutes waiting to be called to fill out paper work, provide insurance and make my copay, never got called! I was not expecting to be done right away but I sat in the waiting room with my sick child seeing people that arrived after me go in, get service and go home! They completely forgot I was there! I kept getting told to wait to be called! Finally walked out and made it the the quick care clinic which was much quicker. Definitely not the doctor for my family!The worst Mexican food I have ever tasted.  One drink and two places of cheese smothered something with no taste or flavoring at all.  $32.00.  The parking lot is full and can't imagine who is going there.  Just awful.  Nothing edible.  Do clients "just not know: WHAT MEXICAN FOOD IS !!!!!!! WARNING..DON'T DO IT.Usually I'm a fan of Burger Bar, good food, reasonable prices, great service. I don't know what happened today, but the new hostess at the front desk couldn't have been bothered by an earthquake. After standing in front of her with an inquisitive look on my face, she finally woke up and asked if I'd like a table? As if I was there wondering what the weather was going to be tomorrow in Machu Picchu. After being told there was a 30-minute wait for 2 people, I went next door to Hussong's and was immediately sat with water and chips on the table in under two minutes. I'm going to go write a review on Hussong's after this margarita!There is an employee named Marcus who works here. He looks like a younger version of Charles Manson and is very rude. One day, he kicked me out of the store just because I walked in with a backpack and threatened me not to come back. I did contact the manager about him, but he never replied back, As far as I know they both still work there and I am boycotting this location until they are fired.They do have some cool stuff,I'll give them that much. The pay out for the top shape stuff I was selling them was laughable. I made waay more selling it on amazon than what they offered me.EVERYTHING is over priced and a good portion of the staff was rude. I won't be coming back anytime soon. As for the guy that was a total jerk to me.Keep in mind that you're a grown man working in a record store that you don't own.Your parents must be proud.When you call  for reservation they try to upsell with resort club.now when you there using it the person who works at the 24th floor where you get the snacks and drinks , the person who works there is giving the customers a hard time to get in the place.been going there for the past couple of years seems like the services is getting less and less the past couple of yearsI would not stay here again.

We arrived at 3 (which is check-in) and were informed that our room was not ready.  Joy.  The check-in guy said it could be a couple hours and that someone would call us when our room was ready.  I asked for some comp drinks and was quickly denied.  When we stayed at the MGM last year, we had the same problem and the clerk offered us $50 credit without us even having to ask.  
Great, been in a plane for 3 hours, no room, what's a guy to do?  Go check out "The Pub" with over 200 beers.  We arrived at the pub about 4 which was shift change apparently.  We sat by the pool (which closes at 5 during the off months, I guess us out of towners get screwed)  Some guy who worked there cam up to us and said that it was shift change and our server would be right with us....   10 minutes later....  same story from the same guy.  10 minutes more... another table is seated next to us.  10 more minutes the server shows up and promptly helps that table... Took 10 minutes of laughing and joking before we got service.  All this time, no water, nothing.   Service was slow and terrible.  The place was not even busy.  Did not go back and would not.  
We sat there for 2 hours without a call from the front desk.  I called and they said the room was still not ready.  WTF?  We have rezzies at 7!  So, I go to the front desk and was greeted by a rude woman.  She tells me the room is now ready no apology or anything.  We finally get to the room to find nasty towels in the shower.  
The bar staff at diablos are pretty snooty as well, you can only sit at a table if you are eating, drinks and apps have to sit in the bar.  Suffice it to say, I was not impressed.  There is too much competition in Vegas to be treated this way.  I will not be back to the Monte Carlo.THE SIRENS OF TI: This is possibly the worst $(%&# I have ever seen. And I have seen some bad #(*%&Y#.I am writing this review as I continue my stay at Treasure Island. I am here in Vegas for CES and so far Treasure Island is not making it easy for me to come back for an additional stay.

When I reserved my room months ago, I specified that I require a non-smoking room due to my asthma - staying in smoking rooms makes my asthma act up and then I can't breathe. When I checked in, there were no non- smoking rooms available. Ok, that's fine. The front desk then found me a room that is smoking "optional" whatever that means.

When I entered my room, I was appalled. The rooms tables, surfaces, dresser and even the sheets has significant dust in them. It was clear the room had not been used or cleaned in a very long time. Running your finger along the surfaces resulted in a dark black layer of dust, so I was very disappointed. When I contacted the frith desk I was told I could not change rooms due to CES. 

When I requested housekeeping to come clean the room it took an hour and a trip in person to the front desk. 

The housekeeping team showed up and did a full clean, but it was pretty annoying and gross to show up in a room so filthy.Holy shit, this place is godawful. I deserve it though for not checking reviews. I'm standing on a line to check in right now. It's been 45 fucking minutes and I'm a little more than halfway through the line. AT 1 IN THE MORNING! Can't wait to see shithole of a room. Hoping I don't catch something. Will never do this again.Worst hotel I've ever stayed at, hands down. Not just in Vegas, in general. I realize its a cheap room in Vegas and what do I expect right? Irregardless I would rather pay a little more and save myself from bed bugs. And I'm not sure if you've read any other reviews talking about the rape me parking lot, but those are absolutely true.We came here for our anniversary dinner on May 1st 2010, I'm writing this review a little late.

The only good thing about this place is the view of the Bellagio fountain while you eat... now the bad parts.

- So loud I couldn't hear my wife talking across the tiny table on our anniversary!

- There were as many kids here as adults, and running around free like it was freaking Chuck E Cheese

- The service was terrible, we waited 45 mins for our food, and my steak came out cold and raw like they just took it from the fridge.  Water refill?  what refill?

- Extremely over-priced mediocre quality food.

If you want a romantic, or quiet, or intimate, or tasty French restaurant go to Pamplemousse, don't waste your time here.We came here for Sunday brunch on the first day of our Vegas trip.  We arrived around 11am after checking into our hotel.  We were starving and craving a nice breakfast.  However, we were sad to learn that unlike other restaurants we were used too, they weren't serving their usual breakfast menu at that time.  They had maybe 5 items on their brunch menu and the rest was off their lunch menu.  I specifically asked the waiter if any other breakfast items were available, but he was unaccomodating.  It was especially dissapointing because the table right next to us were able to order breakfast and they received their food less than 10 minutes before us. As for the food, my boyfriend ordered the waffle with fresh strawberries and whip cream.  It was $15 for ONE waffle that could have came out of a box.  The whip cream that everyone raves about was just meh!  But I must admit that I'm not a huge fan of whip cream in general (waste of calories for something that doesn't even taste that good).  I ordered the quiche which was ok but very rich.  You can definitely taste all the butter and cream they put in it.  It was more of a custard consistency than I'm used to though.  As for the service, our waiter basically sucked and seemed to have airs about him.  He spent most of the time talking in the corner with his friends.  My coffee was never refilled and it took us forever to get our check.  Then it took at least another 10-15 minutes for him to pick it up so he can run our credit card.  We don't usually ask much of our waiters and usually tip very well.  But this was rediculous!  He failed to realize that every minute of his inattentiveness was decreasing his tip.  But maybe the service is better on the outside patio.  We were just too hungry to wait for a table there.  It was immediate seating inside.  Still, a huge dissapointment all around.  Definitely not worth it when there are so many other places to eat on the strip.Beyond upset with my stay here. I only decided to stay here because my cousin wanted to stay here and we were all doing a big trip and just wanted to not be a hassle to walk to a different hotel every day.  Booked this room on Black Friday of 2013. The deal was good! I kept calling then since then till about June to make sure everything is okay and make some changes since I decided to stay longer. (YES I WAS IN VEGAS FOR 7 DAYS NEVER AGAIN) lol. Anyways so I get a email from total rewards about 2 weeks before my stay for a room up grade. So instead of being in my go room with two beds and strip view I upgraded to a 2 bed in a mini suite. The total was $1234 for 7 nights. Not bad...right? So we get there and check in. My party of 3 was there when I was checking in and I ask the Filipino lady with short hair who was working June 17 between 10pm-11pm and she said twice to me $1234 so of course in there diving the total so I can get the amount from the 2 other people.  And the $200 something incidental charges. And we would get reimbursed if nothing was wrong in thee room.  I was upset she never mentioned if the hotel gave me a credit for staying there towards maybe restaurants or anything in Vegas. Which I did apparently, look through my emails. Partly might fault I should have read my emails before going. HOWEVER my boyfriend works at a hotel and they tell all their guest about all the freebies. I'm not trying to be cheap but it would have been nice to be informed that. So we get request a roll out bed. She actually was nice to tell us that we would get it at no charge and we should have it soon in the room. We actually went out and got drinks and we got to our room by like 11pm and my boyfriend went out and he got back before I did which was 1am and STILL NO EXTRA BED. He actually had to call and remind them. So we get to the room and I look around the bathroom is pretty dark.... They need a light in the shower or something. I look online what the room would look like it said we would have a tv in the bathroom...NOPE! No fridge, no microwave and no strip view oh and a dinosaur tv. My cousin had a go room with a nicer tv. I was shocked. I paid more and I get a shitty room. The housekeeping wasn't good. The 6nights I think they only cleaned it 2-3 maxed? Not only that my boyfriend was for the idea to tip the house keepers. They have a job why should we tip them especially if they don't do there job right. We actually ran out of toilet paper one night and had to tissue paper. We cleaned the trash can out and had to use that to put beers in with ice as a nice chest. The next day we get to the elevator and the button in the 21st on the right side facing the window was broken like stuck inside, I mean you can still use it but that was just not acceptable. So the second night I leave my wristlet in the cab yes that is my fault but I walked to lost and found and they basically told me it takes 5-6hrs to look at the tapes so they can say what cab company I was riding with. So they just gave me a list and I called and left a message but no return. So I decided to go back Friday morning and see if maybe they found it. 2 employees were in the hallway as I was waiting for someone at lost and found to help me. I knocked twice and no one opened the door. I pick up the phone and it's ringing and finally an answer. I was so upset that I lost my wallet with ALL MY MONEY AND CREDIT CARDS AND DEVIT CARD. Yes being in Vegas with no form of money is TERRIBLE. So I really wished they could have helped me but the guy that answered said no one returned nothing and I told him "I'm here till Tuesday the 24 can you look at the video from June 18." And the guy said "umm yeah I don't think no one is going to want to do that right now cause we have other things to do than look at the videos" EXCUSE ME IM IN VEGAS AND IM WITHOUT MONEY. I'm paying for my room just like everyone why can't you help me? And I'm actually telling you, you have like 3 days. Do you really have to be a jerk and say that? I leave because I am beyond mad in his response. I give at this point and don't even bother with it cause I had all my stuff expedited. So we finally check out and everything was decent.  However today 1 day later (today) I forward my boyfriend the hotel stay and it's $1533. WHERE THE HELL DID THESE CHARGES COMES FROM THE LADY SAID IT WAS $1234. Looking at the charges, I was never aware of a resort fee. And not only that it looks like the deposit I paid wasn't applied. And then that stupid charge. AND WE DIDNT GET THE  INCIDENTAL DEPOSIT BACK.  We didn't break, steal, or damage anything.I am so upset with this hotel currently waiting on a call from josh the manager and she what they can do because I am furious. NEVER STAYING HERE AGAIN.Looked forward to stay until we were presented with mandatory resort fee at checkin for phone, internet access, gym etc.  Then we found out the pool was closed for the season. This hotel is a JOKE!  You're better off applying the money to a more expensive hotel because this hotel is a waste.  In addition it is dark, rundown, and it needs a major makeover.  The elevators are torn up, the lobby rug is filthy.  It is truly resting on its laurels and the lack of care shows. Also the pool was closed for the season and guests including myself showed up to just see a "pool closed" sign. We all approached the registration desk to find out it was closed for the season. This was very sneaky since we were told at checkin that we had access to the pool. Stay away from this hotel.Day 1
Checked in to the Luxor Hotel and Casino this afternoon.  Long line at registration, but it did move quickly; there was a representative at the front of the line to greet people and she was very personable.  I overheard her talking to the group in front of us about all the different things that the registration clerk would let them know (Buffet's, Show's, etc).  However, our clerk was strictly by the book.  He was very un-personable and we had to pull info our of him.  Not exactly setting a good first impression.  However, he did upgrade us to a tower for free.  

We self parked and walked back to our room.  The parking garage is behind the casino and we had to walk back to the front door just to find our way to our room.  There needs to be a better path to your room from the parking garage.

After we finally made it our room I had to call the front desk to ask where is the ether net cable to log on to the net.  Common sense would put it at the desk in the room but no...it was behind the TV.  Right now I have it stretched across the room so that I can use the net.

When I was on hold for the front desk; I heard a recording about having a refrigerator sent to my room so I called back to inquire about the price...$25 a day.

The Ice Bucket is big enough to fit one bottled water in it and that's all.  So I had to use one of the trash cans as an Ice Bucket.

If you are a germ-a-phob then don't look in the bathroom.  As I was standing next to the toilet I looked up at the vent and notice that it hadn't been cleaned in months (at the least).

The good.  The Bell service is very friendly and quick.  Love the Bell service.
The toilet has one of those powerful flushes that make you proud to sit on the throne.
Love the Hand Soap shaped like a pyramid.One star is being nice.  We decided to stay here during Xmas and it was just awful.  When I checked in I specifically asked the front desk if they charged resort fees and she said no, but when we went to check out, we were charged resort fees!  The elevator smelled like sewage and we were put on the 5th floor next to some sort of dusty ceiling area with a view of nothing.  Faucets were leaky, the cleaning lady barged into our room after just one knock, and the room was dark and looks like a bunker.  Hotel food was also lousy.  We went to Rice and Company for food and the service was horrible and the food was bad.  The sushi was lackluster and the tempura batter was stale on our tempura shrimp.  I would never stay here again and regretted moving from the Monte Carlo to the Luxor.  Don't stay there if you can avoid it.I am not clear why this place is rated highly.  To me, The food is salty and full of butter.  As someone who loves to actually taste fish, I was disappointed when my trout taste like a piece of butter sliding down to clog my arteries.  If you want to eat healthy, this is not the place of low calorie food.   There was just too much seasoning in the dishes I ordered and it masked the natural favors.  Over priced, I even had horrid bowels after this.  The alcohol selection is good.On a recent CES visit, I was able to procure a reservation for 4 at 10 pm on a Friday night.  Great!  I have cooked with Bouchon and various Thomas Keller Sous Vide cookbooks and was looking forward to this.  I had ordered seared Foie gras and Coquille St. Jacques.  The Foie Gras must have been seared in a clear vegetable oil and was bland.  The Coquille St. Jacques?  It must have come from a starvation diet recipe.  Two 1.5 ounces of scallops, and I am being generous on my estimation, on a small bed of sauerkraut for $29.00. It wasn't enough even for an appetizer.  The sauce, and it was a just a sauce, was bland and uninteresting too.  It neither tasted of cheese base or an hint of Pernod or wine.  
My friends had Leg of Lamb stew with white beans.  I am sure that the leg of lamb was cooked separately by the sous vide method and the beans were stewed separately.  There was not a hint of jus from the leg of lamb in the white beans, and the beans were undercooked.  Needless to say, my friends were not impressed.  I was embarrassed for suggesting the Bouchon Bistro to my friends. On an average evening, anyone with some culinary skill could cook better.  Very disappointed.I was there at the Sterling's Sunday Brunch in mid August 2011.  Thought I try out the most expensive buffet in Vegas.  I was quite dissappointed.  First of all, I am a Veteran at the Vegas buffets.  I go to Vegas at least twice a year for the past 15 years and have eaten at every single buffet there is, including, but not limited to, Bellagio, Wynn, Rio, Flamingo, Paris, Planet Hollywood, Caesar's, Mandalay Bay, Mirage, Imperial Palace, Circus Circus, MGM Grand, Treasure Island, Monte Carlo, Harrah's, Stratosphere, M Hotel, Aria, Cosmopolitan, etc...  Therefore, my expectation of the Sterling's Sunday Brunch was extremely high.

When I first walked in, I was very dissappointed with the small spread.  The decor was lacking as well.  Where is the ice sculpture as shown in their website?!?  Their website showed a large spread of food, including crab legs, bread, and an ice sculpture.  The buffet wasn't anything like in the website.

The most dissappointing part was the food.  There were no big Alaskan crab legs at the buffet.  The crab legs at the buffet table were hot, small, and rubbery.  You have to ask for the large ones.  You also have to ask for the caviar.  I found it lame that they would hide the food. 

As for the sushi selection, it was lame.  Again, do I have to ask for the sashimi?  They had cheap items like California roll, etc.

As for the lobster, I had 2 and they were both overly cooked and rubbery.

As for the raw oysters, they only had about 10 at the buffet table and they were constantly running out.

The rack of lamb was tender but wasn't anything special.  The flavor was bland.

There were no giant shrimp coctails at the buffet table.  Maybe, like the crab legs, caviar, and everything else, you have to ask for them.  The service was poor as well.  When I asked for the food, the waiter kept telling me to go to the buffet table.  I had to ask the guy that cut the prime rib for the crab legs and had to ask the lady at the small sushi station for the caviar.

For the price of $85 per person, you can definitely get better food somewhere else like at the Bellagio, Wynn Buffett, Paris, and Planet Hollywood (dinner only since their lunch buffet is not as impressive).  I also liked the buffet at The Cosmopolitan.  "M" Hotel has a good buffet as well for the price.I have heard so many good reviews for this place, so who wouldn't try it? I should have taken the hints before I got my meal, that this wasn't a good choice.

Hint 1: Location - It's right next to a smoke shop and a gas station across the street from a mobile park.

Hint 2: Food test - It was nice that I got to sample the food even if the first sample wasn't up to par, the guy wouldn't leave me alone about sampling.

Hint 3: Decor - I know this should never have anything to do with the food, but it felt like I was eating at a cousins house on the bad side of town, wobbly chairs, wobbly table.

I ordered the teriyaki chicken (didn't think it would be bad, I mean who can mess up teriyaki?) With chicken fried rice (once again, how on earth can you mess up fried rice?) 

The chicken tasted like it was frozen and thawed out all day. Such a horrible taste. The fried rice tasted like it too was thawed out, kind of had a gross tangy after taste. There also wasn't any spices or egg in the fried rice, just a bunch of green onion,which technically isn't a fried rice. This meal can be related to something you get in the frozen section at a grocery store.

They also give you a snickerdoodle cookie, that looked like it could be the best thing on the menu, until I noticed it wasn't cooked all the way through.

But the icing on the cake was the gross pube like grey hair I found floating in my teriyaki sauce. 

So the expensive $8 meal was so not worth it, and I 'm sure when Diners Drive Ins and Dives visited, the food was great, but today it was the grossest thing I've ever had.Im disappointed on this buffet, nothing special If your a tourist and looking for an amazing buffet go to M buffet please.Save your money. Terrible food and then they'll over charge your credit card.Meh, I have been to Tao 2 times in about 10 trips to Vegas... 
it has a lot of potential but is a disappointment every time.

They have some pretty cool VIP areas and I love the dark, sexy red decor but they seem to not have a capacity limit and it gets wayyy too crowded/boiling hot.

When you first enter, there is a side room with bar on the right and THAT is the place to hang out if you want to drink/boogie a little... the other bars in the place are always way too crazy & crowded - the bouncers are over-protective and the bartenders are overwhelmed. Suit yourself and take a peak into the main room for a sec but then trust me, Its honestly not even worth trying!

The drinks are the normal expense - $15-20/cocktail - and the crowd is mostly asian, but you can't really expect different from a club called TAO.

The coolest part of the club was the bathrooms. 
The ladies bathroom area is upstairs and they are all individuals that have glass doors. They actually are see through when the door is open and frost over when it shuts.... that's pretty damn incredible if you ask me!

The dance floor is wayyyy too packed to bust any moves and you can't stop for one minute without having a bouncer flash his light at you telling you to keep moving.

The one other fun part I can remember was that if you did have a table in the main room, you could stand up on the top of the bench seats like a makeshift stage and dance - aka no one sweating on/pushing/elbowing you - and that was a blast.  Just watch your skirt ladies!

Definitely not worth the price of a cover - or the wait in a huge line - or anything actually... The only time I've ever had a good time here was when we had our own private area and that honestly could have been in any club anyway.

Nothing special here and more negative than positive for sure. 
I'd give it a miss.My god, never, ever again.

We came here at about 11:30 on a Tuesday morning for a late breakast/lunch. They were just putting away the breakfast buffet, so seeing that I decided to order from their all day breakfast menu. My husband is a chef, formerly at a hotel, and warned me that it would probably be the worst time of day to be ordering a breakfast since the cooks are winding down from making breakfast probably since about 5AM. Stupidly, I ignored him and ordered it anyway.

I ordered the eggs anyway meal: two eggs, hash browns, bacon, and sourdough toast. Everything was bland and overcooked. My bacon was burnt and flavorless, the hash browns were dry, and my eggs tasted like rubber, and my toast was cold. I would have complained to my server if I could have found her. Unfortunately after a few minutes my hunger got the best of me and I ate the crap anyhow.

My husband's vegetable soup was not any better. He found several vegetable ends in his small cup, and TWO bay leaves. I'd hate to think how many bay leaves the stock pot had in it if two ended up in his tiny cup.

And as I intimated before, our service was AWFUL. We ordered at 11:40 and didn't receive our food until 12:15. And our server was nowhere to be found in the interim. I think she just waited in the kitchen until her orders were up, delivered them and went straight back to the kitchen to wait again instead of checking up on her tables.

The food and the service were terrible, which is a shame since when we initially arrived I thought to myself that I wanted to get up earlier the next day to get their breakfast buffet. After this experience, I will NEVER go back.Worst place EVER

We had 3 guys 5 ladies.  The bouncer took all of our girls.

We had those stupid passes, but the bouncer held everyone in line after 12AM after the passes weren't valid anymore.  It was $40 bucks to get in.

We waited in line for 3 HOURS, all guys in line.  After waiting at the front of the line for about an hour, they let us in.  We were already too pissed.  Our girls had already gotten drunk and were ready to go home so we just left.  The girls told us that it was mostly women and old guys inside.

I would suggest coming with a large group of girls over guys and don't let the bouncer take the girls away.

I'm not coming back here again.Be careful. The bartenders will not give you your change back after ordering a drink.

Either they're too drunk, or it's a way for them to get some extra cash into the bar (I'm guessing the latter). 

I ordered 2 beers, handed her a 20.00, and she walked away and didn't come back. I had to yell over at her, and she knew right away and gave me the exact change back. So that leads me to think she wasn't thaaaat drunk. 

I will not be coming back here.Worst Tex-Mex ever!  Probably the worst meal I've had in Vegas! Horribly slow service.  At one point a guy at the table next to us went back to the kitchen to refill his drink himself.  The margaritas were disgusting. We ordered the premium with "fresh lime."  It came loaded with bad tequila and thick sour mix.  The food was terrible and overpriced.  

Save your money and go somewhere else.  Pink Taco at Hard Rock is a much better choice if you want Mexican at a Casino.THE WORST FOOD FOR YOUR MONEY EVER
Actually, the service was good, but the food....
Happy hour deals tasted worse then McDonalds, greasy and tiny. We've eaten in many expensive 4-5 stars restaurants, and "Seablue" was a joke...
Beef carpaccio that we ordered tasted horrible, and the portion was extremely tiny even for a bird. 
The entrees that we ordered didnt taste anything close to a restaurant food, and again, portion is misearable...
For the quality of food you are getting- price is way too high.
All and all our experience with the food was substandart
Do Not Go!!!This place tastes like old country buffet.... Remember that restaurant???
Carpet smells, food tastes like crap, and service sucks
Don't know what the hype is all abt....
If u want the best buffet in vegas, go to wicked spoon at the Cosmo!!Saw this show a few weeks ago.  What an aweful show!  To be honest, I have been to countless Broadway shows ... I've seen Phantom of the Opera 5 times, Mama Mia 6 times, and I've also seen most of the Cirque De Sole, but this show is one of the worse I have ever seen.  Silly visual effects does not make a good Broadway show.  I'm sorry I went, and I felt it was a waste of my time and money.  There are much better alternatives than this.20 minutes from hitting the front of the line to being seated, hostesses that can't even use English to be rude in and hyper-active busboys. Is it everyone's first day working here? I mean really, when you hit the bar at 10am at a buffet to calm yourself from the terrible service only to come back to a cleared table it sucks. We went to the Paris buffet a few days later and were treated like royalty.The most amazing, delectable, savory pile of bullshit I've ever attempted to obtain sustenance from. Right now I'm laying in my bed upstairs in the Rio, writhing around in pain due to the almost certain food poisoning ill be receiving from my $35 dog slop courtesy of the carnival world buffet. After writing this review ill probably try to go throw up to get these disease-ridden, rancid animal carcasses out of my body that they try to pass off as edible food. 

I found a duck tooth in the serving tray, mentioned it to my friend, and an employee hurriedly ran over and tried to hide the fact that one of these foul, rotten pond creatures had lost a molar in my dinner to be. 

Our waiter came over and was touching the food on my plate with his bare hands in an attempt to give me some unwarranted advice on opening the soggy, atrophied crap they were calling crab legs.

Our server sat me one foot away from a pile of trash and crab detris the size of a dinner plate on the bench seat next to where I was supposed to be able to eat, which of course was impossible due to the rancid fumes coming off this bullshit.

What topped off my terrible experience was looking across the dining hall and seeing a server with his hand deep down the back of his pants, scratching his ass crack, after which he got right back into handling food and drinks. 

Ohh yea, forgot to mention that they let some snobby old woman bring her little dog into the restaurant, just to have it shit all over the place and not get cleaned up for 20 minutes. 

I'm very surprised the rio is still allowed to be open and hasn't killed anyone yet. Ohh wait, that will probably be me in 30 mins. My last words on this earth will be to prevent any would be patrons from dining here. The Rio's World Carnival Buffet is the sickest, most diseased, foul crap I've ever laid my eyes uponLaughing so hard... There is nothing Hawaiian in the market. Not even L&L. The joke is on you.Wow!  WHAT A Waste of money. They should change the name from Le Reve to Le Boring.   This was a complete knock off and wannabe of the show  "O" cirque d soleil. Yes I know the same creator of that show.  I watched pretty much every show in Vegas except for the shit hole ones you find in old Las Vegas. This show might as well been in the Stratosphere.  I mean give me a break $100 per ticket I am glad that I got the cheap seats, that were in front row where you get wet from the water.  If the water didn't splash on me I would have slept through the whole show.  Same oh crap people swinging around doing flips and stunts.  I have seen this a dozen times before.  I am very dissapointed in Steve Wynn.  I would have thought that he would have a better show in his fabulous Casino.  I would rather take my money and play Casino War with it instead of spending it on a boring boring show.  Maybe thats why he put this show in his Casino, so that everyone who leaves the show when its done will gamble, and try to win their money back after they wasted it on this show.anyone who likes Hometown Buffet will like this place. Basically come with low standards and no taste buds. This place/decor also does not impress. 

yes there are crab legs. It is NOT precut like the other buffets. Sometimes I prefer to eat like a lady and not get my hands too messy. Had it been pre cut/sliced (you know what i mean) i would've gave this place 2 stars. 

don't waste your time and if you can't get this comped just save your money and go to Hometown Buffet (yuk) instead. Same low quality. 

if you're still reading the reviews and hoping for the best... good luck! Just listen to me and say NO to Flavors! Your taste buds will thank me later!I am not embarrassed to say I LOVE buffets. I am, however, embarrassed to write the review of this one.  I saw this buffet on a few top ten lists, all of which praised it for being far more affordable than the other top-notch Vegas buffets.  
My experience was laughably bad.
First, it's only $10 cheaper than some of the best buffets in Vegas (Bellagio may be my fave) at $27, and the experience is night and day.
Much of the food was mislabeled or had no name cards at all, and when I'd mention that fact to the cooks behind the counter, they literally shrugged.  I asked to move to a table near an outlet so I could charge my phone, and the waiter told me "no one will help you there", so I sat 15 feet from where they sat me... He walked past me 10 times and never got me a drink or said another word to me.
The food was just OK. Not as big a selection as the Rio or Wynn, and while I'm not big on shellfish and sea food, I'd say that was the strength of this buffet. The dessert selection was huge, but much lower-quality than any of the top-notch buffets.
I ended up eating a make-your-own fajita, which is a bad sign. There are so many better choices, avoid this one.WOW - this is definitely one of the WORST places to go to eat in Las Vegas. I used to hear about how great this buffet was and I just never got the chance to try it. Well, I finally did and wish I didn't!
 In fact, I wish I could put no stars because that's what this restaurant deserves!

I am definitely a foodie and when I get to enjoy good food, I am a happy person. This last trip to Vegas, I got to enjoy many great buffets - Wicked Spoon (lunch and dinner), Bachannal Buffet and the Buffet @ the Wynn.

Le Village's standard is worse than Hometown Buffet. Everything is laden with salt. Don't bother trying the seafood dishes either. Everything tasted frozen and old.  Even the breads were cold and stale. How can you mess that up?
And as for presentation - it reminded me of the horrible buffet from the movie, "Vegas Vacation". Everything looked brown, saucy and yellow.

And to top of our visit, we were sat in the section with the worst waiter. An older gentlemen who said "oh my god" as he came to our table. When I asked him for an ice tea, after he forgot the first time, he scolded me and cut me off with "okay, don't worry, i got it". And then never bringing me my ice tea - EVER. He disappeared after that. He didn't even take away our dirty plates. I had to take my plates and my guests plates over to the bus boy station, myself.

TO SUM IT UP -- DON'T GO HERE! Everything from service to food deserves a big giant F!!!I loved the atmosphere, but that was about it. It was small, the water was luke warm, the sauna was too cool, the steam room was too hot and the attendants were not helpful. The front desk ladies were kind and informative. there was suppose to be an attendant to give us a tour we waited and went ahead with out them.  No towels for large chested women so good luck with that. just let your girls run free!

For a refreshment there was coffee, tea, juice and water. Lord help you if your blood sugar drops. I booked a private bath. the attendant was nice but kept checking on me too much. I received an apple with the bath so i guess you get a small snack if you spend 150 bucks on a bath. the spa water ate away my new swim top so i had to go around naked. I tried to prevent further damage and use their machine that wrings out excess water. It says to use it to prevent chlorine damage. i did and it tore my bathing suit top beyond repair. When we tried to speak to a manager it went no where. Rachel, who we had to ask her name, had little to say, When i told her that my suit was being destroyed by the water and i only had it in there a few minutes she stated, " Well i wouldn't know about that i don't swim here."  WOW! I told her they need to have a sign up waring against using bathing suits with under-wires if that is the cause for the problem.  She never apologized, she told me i could speak with security. She said i could file a lost or damaged property report. I did. Compensation was not my goal. My top was expensive but the problem is that it is hard to find one that fits right in the first place. I just didn't want this happening to someone else. I haven't heard anything back from them at all so i am sure the incident will go unnoticed. 

I was so disappointed with the whole experience. I wish we would have gone to another spa, one that actually cares about good customer service. from beginning to end it was just not relaxing. I don't want to have a good time in spite of the spa, and i definitely don't want to leave feeling ripped off and damaged. NEVER AGAIN!I never actually got to see the show but customer service here sucks I spoke with the guy about purchasing 1st and 2nd row seats for 11 girls for a total of $643 and after he received my money he said the seats were going to be 7th and 8th and said he never guaranteed those seats that they were sold. OK they sold but before I spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars SAY SOMETHING instead of just taking my money and then saying something...I'm furious this was a bachelorette party and he screwed up the main event of the night!!!Had to wait 35 minutes for a burger, then another 15 for my check. Understaffed VERY SLOW SERVICE. Food was marginal at best. With so many great places in Las Vegas to eat I would not waste any time at this place again.A waste of space that could have been well used. The venue is smaller and simpler, but not worth your time. 

I've never had to pay to enter a club in LV, but the bank made me pay $20 and said I get a 'mixed drink' at the bar. Of course I find out it's just a well drink. The bartender over poured the vodka and strange enough I couldn't even taste it in my vodka tonic. I hate rip off places that water down their drinks. 

The music was ghetto. I didn't even know who the DJ was. 

On top of it all, the woman in the front was extremely rude. One would imagine the cashier could give you a smile while asking for $20 from you. 

Definitely one of the many, "we're doing YOU, the customer, a favor" places in LV. We are the reason you are in business... And there is no appreciation. Save your time and money and go to XS or Hakkasan. At least they serve real alcohol there.Wow.  Poor, poor, poor Neonopolis.  If Shakespeare rose from the dead and wanted to write a new tragedy, it would probably be about Neonopolis.  Act 1 would be the facility opening, Act 3 would be Jillians and the hope of Star Trek: The Experience coming here, and Act 5 would be Las Vegas Rocks closing.  Neonopolis is to Las Vegas like what the Virtual Boy was to Nintendo: both had noble dreams and looked excellent on paper, but both ended up being complete failures in reality.  

Quick history about this place.  Most of the retail space was vacant throughout most the facility's history, and it was tough to fill the empty spaces with establishments.  Jillians was a fun arcade/lounge type of place similar to Gameworks and Dave and Buster's, but it suffered from badly maintained machines and overpriced games.  Not long before it closed, the fraternity I was in held a rush (recruitment) event in one of the banquet rooms in there, and while it was fun it was one of the few good things about Jillians.  The place closed shortly after.

It had a movie theater, but why go to a theater there when you could just go to another one closer to where you live, and where parking is easier?  Plus, the lack of air conditioning IN A DESERT made it difficult to lure moviegoers in.  It soon closed.

They later had a Poker Dome event.  It was a nice facility, and the spectator areas were pretty cool and high tech.  Unfortunately, watching people play poker is nowhere near as entertaining as actually playing poker.  In fact, watching Garry Kasparov play chess would probably be more exciting than watching poker.  Now while some of you might enjoy watching poker on television, I just can't get into it.  Needless to say, when the champion was crowned, they didn't do this again.

When Star Trek: The Experienced closed down at the Hilton, Trekkies like myself were heartbroken.  However, we were relieved when told that The Experience would be relocated to Neonopolis.  Unfortunately, after numerous auctions selling props from The Experience took place, it's relocation to Neonopolis is about as likely as Captain Picard manning the Starship Enterprise again.  The Experience remains stranded in the Delta Quadrant, and Neonopolis remains in the Neutral Zone.

Las Vegas Rocks closing looks to be the final nail in Neonopolis's coffin.  It's quite sad, really.  Neonopolis had everything in paper to be THE revitalization for the Downtown area.  And while First Friday and the large number of plush and comfortable bars and lounges are revitalizing the area in itself, Neonopolis remains a proverbial ghost town, a reminder of what could have been, but never was.

PROS:
Filmmaker looking for a creepy, deserted place?  Here you go!

CONS:
Everything

THE VERDICT:  Just pretend it never happened.Days latter and I am still feeling frustrated about our experience.  I was part of a large group celebrating my friends bridal party.  The maid of honor worked so hard on planning and putting together an amazing night, and I hated seeing her taken advantage of, this place is terrible.  They originally told her $35 per person, app entree and dessert, then they told her $45, then they removed dessert.  Poor girl had to keep updating us that we were paying more and getting less, lots of pressure on her.  Then we get there, the service was inattentive, and unenthusiastic.  The meal consisted of less than one cup of greens, a small wedge of cheese, a bad dressing and two grape tomatoes as the salad and only option for an appetizer.  The pork option I chose was the worst pork chop I have ever had, as tough as possible and bland.  The mashed potatoes were dry, but flavored well, the only thing on the plate that was, the vegetable was three sprigs of asparagus and the sauce was way too sweet.  The portion was tiny.  The gratuity was added, as it should be for such a large party, making the bill $58 for a tiny amount of crappy food.  I love fine dining, I understand small portions are the usual, but they are made to perfection and satisfy through quality.  Not here.

The thing that has nothing to do with me, but still makes me so angry is our reservation was set for a certain number of girls, and some were unable to make it and didn't tell the maid of honor until hours before our reservation, the restaurant still charged her for two of the three plates for people who were not even there.  They sent it with her in a doggy bag, so she got food for the charge, but 14 girls were there, 14 $58 paying people, they profited HUGELY from our group, those two bills did not need to be charged.Simple breakfast food took about an hour to get to us. When we asked about it our server gave us attitude and rolled his eyes. When the food finally came it was subpar and hashbrowns were cold. Will never go there again and won't recommend. The last thing you want when you're hungover and hungry is bad food/service that takes forever.I did not like this ice cream. I had a few bites - threw it away. Didn't have the flavor/texture of the real deal. It looked like ice cream, had all the proper attributes of ice cream... but it wasn't. Maybe its an Asian take on what we know as ice cream? Me no likey.After waiting for a parking spot with no results, I found a remote spot in the nearby neighborhoods.  Boo.

The wait was waaaaaaay too long, but I had an enjoyable time checking out the grocery store next door.

Ok, so pizza, wine, etc.  - not too bad.  
But here's where it went wrong.

My ditsy waitress charged my credit card three times for my entire table's bill.  Then the ditsy manager couldn't fix it.  So I was then charged for my meal.  Hoping things went well.

Instead, my debit card was charged four times.

So I called back a few days later and the other ditsy manager gave me the run around, and refused to refund my credit card for the mistakes she and the other sorority girl made.  I was told to wait it out.
I called back later on that week for a second opinion and received the same hurried answer from another manager.

Three weeks later, it disappeared from my bank statement.

I believe that a restaurant should be service that compliments their food.
The food was ok. but not worth the hassle.Their food might be excellent but my family and I will never know. 

I was planning my wedding in las Vegas for this June and Sensi was our first choice for the post-ceremonial feast. We heard SO MANY lovely things about their accommodating staff and fabulous vegetarian options that we could hardly wait. 

I contacted them in February to begin the menu selection process and they got back to me with a decent pace (not as fast as others but I still had 4 months so I wasn't in a hurry). 

So, time passes, I've been in contact with the folks at Sensi for almost 2 months now, and I finally get all the information I need from my family (RSVPs and whatnot for close to 30 people) to make my reservation. I make the call and leave a message. I get an e-mail in response stating that our schedules jut don't jive (I'm about to drop a few thousand dollars on your place and you can't make time to call me?) AND that the restaurant closes EVERY JUNE for 10 days of "repairs and renovations". 

In the 2 months that we were talking no one thought to mention that?! Okay, fine, the email said they didn't have the dates yet so I can maybe see how they wouldn't want to frighten me off unnecessarily, but I'd still would  have liked some warning. 

The final straw was when the events coordinator never got back to me to tell me the exact dates they'd be closed this June (the 6th through 16th if you're curious) like she said she would. I had to call the restaurant and speak with a hostess, who had more information than the manager apparently, to find out for myself. 

I found their treatment unprofessional, insulting, and entirely frustrating for something that should have been so simple as making a reservation.I thought I was going to die without my caffeine fix.  The drive thru line took forever and the parking lot was full.  I don't understand why after the service I got.So I somehow managed to stay at this place again but this time it wasn't a timeshare stay.  I have to say that this stay here sort of gave me the creeps because of a couple odd things happening for the one night I was there.  Typical night of intoxicated Vegas we end up back at the room to crash...I forget what floor we were on but at some point during the night there was a loud crash.  I didn't hear it but after it happened I was woken up by someone that I was there with.  For a second I thought that they were going nuts and perhaps they were hearing things so I shrugged it off.  After that I couldn't fall asleep so I just laid in bed staring at the wall but a little while after that I started to hear scratching, as if someone was scratching the carpet.  I get up turn on the lamp and check the bathroom and no more sound.  So I thought to myself "i must be tired or something" and go back to laying in the bed.  Couple minutes later I start to hear that scratching again and I'm thinking "where the heck is that noise coming from??"  After listening for like 5 minutes I finally decide that the noise is coming from the front door and that it was some prank by some kids.  So I get up go to the door and open and no one was there.  I even left the lights off to try to get the jump on them.  So then my Ghost Hunters mode kicked in and I started to piece it together that maybe there's something ghostly in the room.  By then I was so tired I really didn't care so I left the lamp on and the sound never came back.  Odd story I know.....but interesting.We went to the Village buffet with high hopes since we are avid fans of the Rio Carnival World Buffet. As seafood lovers, we were excited about trying out this buffet at the same hotel. We were VERY disappointed. Don't be fooled by the notion that there will be an amazing assortment of fresh seafood here, afterall the name is the Village SEAFOOD Buffet. 

The lobster was chewy, rubbery, bland, and mushy. Seafood should NOT taste like this. The crab legs were mediocre, with the same problem as the lobster - chewy, rubbery, and mushy. The Carnival World Buffet is a way better buffet for the price and selection. The crab legs there are 100x better.Porta Alba is an "irish pub" of pizza.  The sort of pizza joint that is commonplace in more affluent neighborhoods, offering a more "european" atmosphere and pizza.  Don't be fooled. the pizza is nothing to rave about, unless you are impressed by paying over $12 for a small piece of dough with some tomato and cheese slopped on top.  Here was our dinner: one personal pizza, one pasta entree, three salads and 1/2 carafe of wine (all of which was ok at best).  The price: $80 including the tip.  Estimated true value: $20.70$ for the two off us that included eggplant and gnocci that tasted like the olive garden.  My wife said her meal was good, but I was seriously disappointed.  If I'm paying 25$ for a plate of pasta, you better give me food orgasms.  Well, olive garden tasting food was far from it, plus the parking situation is a joke.WHO WANTS THE BUBBLE GUTS?

I guess I do, cause that's what we got after having breakfast here today. 

I came here today for breakfast with the Yelp-izzles. Thanks Elnino F. for organizing this breakfast and for letting us take advantage of your gift certificate! The other major players at the table were Jieun L., Sun M., and Oliver M. There was only one lucky player who walked away without the Bubble Guts. 

I ordered a Farm Benedicts with the Sage Fried Chicken cause I wanted to do it Man v. Food style. There was not enough chicken to go with the amount of eggs, biscuit, and mashed potatoes on the plate. The biscuit was dry. The chicken and spinach was good. The slice of pineapple and orange was probably the best thing on the plate. I had a Fresh Lemonade Mimosa to drink. It was ok.

I guess I will have to come back to give them another try since I also bought a gift certificate from Sunny Dining Deals. I wanted to give 2 stars cause the service was great, but 4 out of 5 got sick so I couldn't do it.I don't understand why this place is still around. Completely overpriced, not to mention AWFUL.

My age dashi tofu was swimming in the sauce, and literally turned to mush when I tried to eat it. The sushi was not fresh at all, and looked worse than the pre-packaged sushi you get at Ralph's. I mean, the fish looked like PLASTIC. Even my vegetable roll was awful, with strangely soggy vegetables and non-sticky rice. My buckwheat noodles were edible, but definitely nothing to write home about, and unfortunately the whole experience had already been ruined.

The edamame was decent. But really, how can you screw up edamame?I didn't go to Toby Keith's expecting great food or ambiance, but I did hope that his selection of 'country cookin' would be better than average, what with his cowboy hat and all. We were seated quickly (I'll give 'em that), but the service was anemic at best.

The food arrived, and my girlfriend and I sat there munching stoically without comment for a few minutes. We were both hungry, and even though I had several comments, I kept them to myself for that initial interval. Finally, she broke down and said "Any good?"

I replied: "Well, it tastes like the boot, right after Toby Keith pulled it out of Al Qaeda's ass!" - and then I illustrated my point by taking a sharp bite with my canines and holding it down for ten seconds, and showing her that I hadn't made a dent in the meat!

Toby, a couple of suggestions for you:
1. Leave the jingoistic songs to someone who does *not* own a restaurant, and concentrate on upgrading your food from "horrible" to "barely passable" - this will be a huge step forward.
2. If you must involve yourself with patriotic activities, please wrap care packages of your food and drop it off between the Afghan/Pakistan border. After two days, I'm positive they'll surrender. Your menu selections will do more damage than the MOAB.

They do take plastic and the monorail will drop you off pretty close, but I'd recommend going elsewhere, even if you're on your last vestige of strength and absolutely must eat. This restaurant has probably lost Toby more fans than his singing ever will.This place gets a one star because of the price I got the room and how big it was other than that this place is NOT THE PLACE TO GO! Unless you like to be treated like you're an unwelcome guest then stay here. If you need anything but another room key the staff gives you a hard time about it. I stayed here with my boyfriend for one of our friend's birthday. The lady that checked us in was amazing super sweet and she was the last person to treat us well. After that we needed extra towel and was told that house keeping was over and couldn't receive any. Then my boyfriend and I wanted to do a late check out and our only option was to pay $61 to check out at 6p.m. luckily we wanted to watch the Charger game but really $61 for a late check out!? Then the lady was giving my boyfriend a hard time and said that there wasn't a credit card on file. And then the worse part was when we were watching the game the TV started to mess up so my boyfriend calls and ask if they can fix it and the lady says "weren't you suppose to check out already?" Are you serious!? What kind of customer service is that!? If the lady would have dropped her attitude and rude comments to boyfriend and saw that we PAID for a late check out then maybe I would have given this place 3 stars. I have never felt so unwelcomed at a hotel before. The rooms are amazing but the customer service SUCKS!!!!!If I could give a zero..I would. Worst effin workers here I've experienced since moving to Vegas..I kid u not. First they don't get my order right. Then when I get my sandwich I noticed it was dry...it was supposed to be with Dijon mustard as advertised. At first I thought ok no problem, let me just ask for some on the side. When I ask for it..the lady had no idea what I was saying. Pointing to the breads and saying sandwich....don't know how u mistake that for Dijon mustard. So after 5 minutes of trying to explain to her what it is and going through mayo and other condiments that I wasn't talking about, she finally says she just makes the sandwiches...umm..o..k..obviously not how described in the menu...then my girlfriend asks for her rolls they forgot to give her...so I go to another worker who hopefully speaks a bit of English if I can get it and she say says "she didn't give it to u?" No...that's why I'm standing here waiting like an idiot. Then my girl asks if she can get her pizza warmed up and the girl says we can't its against policy...my girl wasn't having it and thankfully the chef heard and told her of course u can just put it in the oven! In a tone where it seemed like he wanted to call her a jackass. Any way ..stay away from this place..they can't prepare a sandwich like they describe and what they did make was horrible..pizza was bleu...just don't go here...walk FAR AWAY! 
.September 1, 2011 will always be known to me as the day I had surgery. Due to a birth defect, my left kidney was enlarged and obstructed in two places. The surgery corrected this life-threatening issue.

The days that followed will live in my memory for other reasons--such as being the first time I ever spat out a Philly Cheesesteak sandwich. I had a three-inch incision on the left side of my abdomen. After being allowed only clear liquids and intravenous vitamins and minerals for 48 hours, the only thing in my mind that would make me feel human again was a meal. And I thought anything would have tasted appetizing.

Two mornings after surgery, my family was visiting and we wanted lunch. I scanned the various choices. Three words caught my eye like a nurse with a needle: Cheese Steak Hoagie. I quickly smiled with pleasure, messing up a cheezesteak sandwich is impossible, right?

As the hours passed, my hunger grew, finally, the only thought in my mind was how wonderful that Cheese Steak Hoagie would be. My mouth began to water as the thought of lunch filled my mind. As the smell of real food stopped in front of my door, I quickly sat up and cleared off the small table at my bedside. A delightful atmosphere filled the room as dad carried in the treasures. My stomach growled louder as the food was within reaching distance. All I could think about was the Cheeze Steak I was about to devour.

I hurriedly unwrapped my meal, anticipating the mouth-watering sandwich. I lifted the sandwich and took a large bite. As I began to chew, my hunger quickly subsided as the flavor hit my tongue. While I looked around the tray for a napkin, my mother, who had been by my side since arriving at the hospital, knew something was wrong by the expression that came upon my face. The napkin became home to the only bite of lunch I ate.

"Mom, that is the worst thing I have ever tasted," I said as I rinsed my mouth out with juice. "It's worse than the medicine," a horrible liquid I had received just before entering the operating room.

My mother assured me that my intravenous pain killers and other medicines were the cause of the disgusting taste. To prove her wrong, I made her try it. She pulled off a small portion of the sandwich and began chewing. All of a sudden, the same disturbing look that had come over me consumed her. She quickly grabbed another napkin and spat out the bite, apologizing and admitting how horrible the meal tasted.

My appetite had disappeared like a doctor being paged. The most memorable meal of my life is one I couldn't allow myself to eat.Letting a boring girl like Lindsay have her own show it just prrof that no one listens to this station. It has to be years since I stuck with this boring channel. I wish they would sell theimselves like 103.9. Even 80's music is better than being bored to death.Terrible terrible terrible...been going here for many years, always for Dim Sum.  This place has been slowly going down hill but today was the final straw.  Service was horrible.  Selection was even worse...they had one steam cart and one fried cart for the entire place.  The steamed ones were dry and waaayyyyy over done.  Definitely go someplace else.There was a bug on the table the hostess tried to seat us at, that kinda ruined my will to eat there, and the food I DID try was mediocre. Never going back again.Great product, horrendous service ...especially on holidays. I pre-ordered, pre-paid for my cakes. I was instructed to pick then up anytime before closing. Closing was scheduled @4:00. I arrived @ 2:30 to discover a "Disneyland style line" of about 50 customers just for pick up. Then they had two lines for walk ins that could literally wait a few minutes, pick up their cakes and go. Poor handling, unacceptable communication by the staff especially when they yelled at all the customers. It was so bad I just forfeited my pre-paid order and walked out. NEVER AGAIN will I support that company.I'm not going to lie, with so many better buffets out there at around the same price, why go here? This place is a step above Hometown Buffet, and that's not saying much. The only thing I can commend this place for is their "premium" drinking water at the soda machine and their desserts. However, you can find the same selection of desserts at any other Vegas buffet.This review is only  on the customer service on reservation cancellations and management communications.

Canceled a reservation for my boss and apparently they do not have the standard 48 hour requirement.  Theirs is 72 hours.  We were penalized one night's stay.  Fine.  

Tried to retrieve the invoice for the charge to complete an expense report and apparently this request is brain surgery.  I called and was connected to reservations and they sent me an invoice alright, for a charge for two room nights?  Not only that but the document was quite official which was impressive but the charge was for the base room price, no tax or any additional resort fees which tells me that it was a manually and carelessly generated invoice.  That was day one.

Called again and the reservations representative apologized and mentioned he would look into it and there went day two with no return call or follow through.  Before the end of my day which is 3pm, i called the hotel and asked to speak to a manager.  Until today, day three... no call back.

As mentioned, it's now day three.  I called the hotel myself and stayed on the phone until i got an actual manager on the phone.  Then she transferred me to accounts payable at which by this time I had repeated my story to THREE different people.  ANNOYING.

FINALLY, Amelia Carr from Accounts Payable took the time to make sure I got what I needed.  

REALLY???  three days for an invoice???  SHOOT ME NOW.I've been to the Bouchon Bakery in Yountville (which I give a rating of 3) and it's much better than this Vegas kiosk. When I went last time, my cupcake was overly sweet that I could only eat a couple bites, the macarons lacked a crispy shell and tasted more like whoopie pies, and my cookie was a little too hard. Overall the baked goods at this location do not taste very fresh. It's always crowded too so the staff isn't very friendly and rushes people in line.I had the Pollo fundido ... The chicken dry as the desert sand and had a similar texture. The beans were nasty and the rice way over cooked and mushy. This was a sad state of affairs..Booked for two nights 9/17-9/18/2013. Possibly the most ratty, rundown place I've stayed at in decades.  First room pervasive mold in the air, we had to move. Second room, not much better. Couch damp, frayed and soiled. Random, unmatched furniture seriously deeply scratched. Bed headboard thick with dust. 
Do not book your room based on photos that accompany room descriptions, whether on resort site or a third party site. Your $150 double ( + resort fee) will not resemble any picture in the world. Swimming pools need cleaning, candy wrappers and unidentified and disgusting debris float by. Loose tiles and railings on stairways to various places on the property. We checked out after one night, willing to forfeit the money just to escape the dank and damp (yes, arid AZ and these rooms were damp!).Lesson learned: Don't ignore your instincts, and don't walk into a store whose signage is only 1/4 lit up on a Saturday night!

Why, Oh why did I drag myself out of the car when I saw the telltale signs of a disastrous meal ahead! The person at the counter is obviously not interested in his job...he never made eye contact, never greeted us, and later we saw him hanging out with his pals inside the store. He seemed to have too much time on his hands...on a Saturday night! 

We ordered a full plate of ribs and sides of potato salad and mac and cheese. The best thing I liked about the meal was the salad, which should definitely not be the case for a BBQ restaurant!

The table tops were greasy, the food was served on styrofoam plates, and there were two huge open trash containers parked inside the restaurant! One was right near the condiments counter, and I was thoroughly disgusted! Honey B, can you at least put a lid on your trash?

The food, well, the less said the better. Microwaved ribs, chewy and tough, slathered with nothing-amazing BBQ sauce. Blah! Oh and my 7-up...I don't know what liquid they were serving under the guise of 7-Up. It was some watered-down flavored thing. Disgusting!

The whole place had an atmosphere of neglect and abandon. So much so that my friend even asked the guy at the counter if they were closing down! Oh Honeyyyy!First meal of the day at Vegas and its breakfast.. I get tons of breakfast foods; eggs, bacon, waffles,donuts, ham, and hash browns. I decide to get a omelet with everything on it including the shrimp. The next few hours I get sick and my stomach is churning like threes no tomorrow. Everyone was fine besides me and I find out I am only the person that got an omelet with shrimp. So it has to be that that got me sick. All around the food was really bland or salty. I was stuffed at the end but who isn't at a buffet. You gotta get your moneys worth. Anyways I would've gave it a 3 star but since I got sick it looses both star and only is left with 1. Too bad.We decided to stop by here before leaving our long 4th of July weekend...BIG MISTAKE!  There were 2 lady servers and 1 man, all were very disorganized and MEAN!   The servers would not stop yelling and arguing amongst themselves, and the yelling would continue throughout the whole restaurant.  The servers argued in a loud yelling manner to one customer that received an incorrect order, the customer yelled right back  which started a crazy yelling match, 2 lady servers vs. a lady customer!  

There was no follow-up service, and the wicked servers (which I believed own the place) would rather have you not in there!!!  During our meal there were multiple customers that walked out on them, GOOD CHOICE, WISH WE WOULD'VE WALKED OUT BEFORE WE HAD A CHANCE!!!    I've never seen servers so relieved to see customers walk away--Out the Door!

And like some of the other reviewers said, they try to sell you appetizers and just bring them out to you;  forcing you to eat them!!  If you order and refuse an item you are destined for a BIG Argument!

I can stand poor/bad service sometimes, but when I go to a restaurant I expect to at least not, get yelled at very loudly (indeed it happened to us once when we got napkins off another table because there was NO Service), see other patrons having yelling matches with the servers, see employees yelling at eachother constantly, and fighting to pay your bill and being told to wait (at least 30 mins.)!

NEVER EVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!WORST PLACE EVER!!! RUDEST STAFF I EVER MET!!!!
now i didn't stay at their hotel but i was in the casino and their staff at the gaming tables were BEYOND rude.

i'm just standing there, watching my boyfriend play roulette and the roulette ball tossing woman decides to card me even though i'm not playing. Okay, no big deal. 
I hand her my US Passcard and it's obvious she has absolutely NO idea what she's looking at, she hands it over to the guy next to her who's stacking the chips and he too has no idea what he's looking at, at which point they hand it to the female pit boss who (guess what?) has NO IDEA what she's looking at and they start giving me a hard time about it. 
It was the day before my 30th birthday. Yes, THIRTY! 3-0. 
Thanks for ruining my birthday Caesar's Palace with your incompetent staff who were practically on the verge of tossing me out of the casino if i didn't conveniently have my passport on hand. 

it's absolutely ridiculous having two female chinese immigrants harassing me about my United States passcard whilst IN THE UNITED STATES. 
what kind of absurdity is THAT?!
And then they have the nerve to tell me that it would've been better had i shown them my driver's license. 
so you're telling me that you know what all 50 driver's licenses look like and what all 200 country passports look like BUT you have no clue what a United States passcard looks like when you work and live in the United States?!

You need to better train your employees on their manners and what government issued IDs look like. You are lucky yelp requires a 1 star minimum because honestly, you deserve ZERO STARS!Close this Place. 
Should have know it. Empty Restaurant on Thursday Night. 
Service was very very nice but the Food. Awfull. 
Pf. Chang & Panda Express have better Food than this Restaurant. 

The Dessert Menu was a joke 3 Things to choose. 

Skip this Place.This place has the worst food ever. We ordered Pho and it was bland. Even putting the sriracha and hoisin sauce was still nasty. Guess how much they charge for a bowl!? 18 bucks! Seriously? Here in Oakland it's 7-8 bucks and it's delicious. Now I understand why it's expensive cuz its a hotel rest. but damn at-least make ur pho better..We also ordered pad Thai and it wasn't good. If you want to get pho go to Chinatown in Vegas it's way better and cheaper. It's not that far. Customer service sucks at this place too. Came here cuz we were in a rush. We didn't want the Pacquiao bus leaving us to go to LA.Disapointing!!! To be fair, I only tried the cupcakes and not the cookies. But the cupcakes....so boring! I tried several of each flavor which included the seasonal peach. The peach cupcake had no flavor and I couldn't taste the peach in the cupcake at all (aside from the peach bits on top). The carrot cake is ok...but nothing special! I could get the same thing at the grocery store or makethen at home. The only one that I actually wanted to finish was the "chocolate chocolate", the frosting had a good flavor. All the other cupcakes went un-finished as they weren't even worth the calories. The other people at our gathering also left their cupcakes un-eaten.....how embarrassing! I also have to mention that when I bought the cupcakes (I bought over 20), the lady did not give me the special bakers dozen price of $23.88 or however much it's supposed to be, She charged me for each individual cupcake....ouch! I feel cheated. Lesson learned, spend the extra money for cupcakes with a real flavor punch and quality that leave you and your party guests licking their plate for the crumbs (which in my opion would be Sprinkles)! So disapointed that I wasted my hard-earned money on this place.Rolled in with some homies to ingest some greasy food before a bout of drinking. They sat us a beer pong table. That shoulda been a red flag. Hey, fuck it, we're in a sports bar, whatever man. Bring us some sandwiches and beer. Please. Now.

Our order took the better part of an hour to deliver. Our order wasn't difficult and the place wasn't busy. They don't serve ice water but instead will sell you bottled tap water with their logo on it for a dollar. Hey, in Vegas, everything costs.

Then they bring out everyone's food except for one guy's. His order takes another 15 minutes to come out. I timed it. (The server gave his patty melt to another table; they were seated after us.) Some guys at the table are done with their meal before homie even takes his first bite. 

Another one of the homies says that the bell peppers on his cheesesteak are gross and slimy and taste pickled. He brought this up to the waitress an she argued that the peppers are cut fresh every day. She's a liar. Why not just apologize and bring a new one, sans peppers? Argue with a customer about something you didn't cook? The fuck outta here.

On top of all that, the hostess allowed a party of six to play beer pong 1.5 tables away from where we were eating. Beer pong balls kept exiting their field of play and bouncing under our table; the assholes following the ball. We kicked the ping pong balls into the bathroom. They drank their beers with piss. Beer Pong? Cool, good times! But not where paying customers are trying to enjoy a meal. I hope they tasted the piss. They left after one game.

If this sounds like a deal for $25-35, you've found your ultimate sports bar and grill experience.

Terrible. I hate your guts Blondies.We went in for breakfast and it was worst experience at a restaurant that I've had in at least 5 years.

Service- Slow and nobody was in there and they had enough waitress on staff. Our waitress had an annoying high pitched voice. I would suggest she gets out of the restaurant industry and join the circus.

Coffee- Terrible. When it was suggested that the coffee wasnt good the waitress said the coffee is terrible here but she was glad to get a fresh pot of crap coffee going for us....yum. She should have just served up scolding coffee and dump it on my crotch and have the bar tender throw the cream in my face.

Meanwhile it is taking forever just to get water to us.

Food- the food finally comes out except for my friends who had to sit and watch us eat half our meals before he got his. BTW he got the same thing as everyone else. nothing special.

My meal was Chicken fried steak and eggs. Kinda hard to screw that up. First off they successfully failed. The piece of meat was thin and small to begin with (thats fine) but they over fried the steak. And they served it already cut down the middle (as if they were checking if it was done). The gravy came on the side and looked soupy. Almost Man sauce like. 

I almost felt like  the restaurant cook wanted me to get on my knees and dump hot gravy on my face.

Meanwhile we are in a sports bar right? Well my friend was looking at one direction of the bar that was just showing rap videos (he said he wished he was Tupac'd) and I was facing the projection tv that was completely angled wrong. I felt like I was Biggie Small'd.Mediocre food, horrible, horrible service.  Made my Mom, wife myself and two kids feel like we were a burden by being there.  We were sat outside, it was in the high 90s  we sweated it out for over a half an hour until another couple arrived and they immediately turned on the fans and mister system.  I will never eat or go to this restaurant again unless I want to feel like a third class citizen.  Besides, the food is nothing specialThis place is atrocious, there prices are higher than all their sister stores and don't include rice and beans in their combo's. While I was eating there the staff apparently thinks that no one knows Spanish and was swearing like there was no tomorrow....Including someone who appeared to be a Manager. I will never step foot in here again, rather going to the much better quality sister store in Peoria off of UnionVery disappointed tonight.  My husband ordered the individual pizza and I ordered the roast beef sandwich.  We waited a very long time with no food.  Finally asked the server to check after people who had arrived after we did had food and were almost finished eating.  It turned out that our order had been lost.  I understand that  any place can make a mistake from time to time.  Finally got our food after waiting an hour and 20 minutes.  My roast beef was cold....not just room temperature, but actually refrigerator cold.  I had asked for onions on the sandwich.  There was one almost undetectable piece of onion.  I couldn't eat the cold beef.  I was told they couldn't warm it up but would make me a new sandwich.  I had already waited an hour and a half.  I asked to speak to manager.  I was told that he was busy in the back on the computer!   They did comp the meal but not a great help as I left hungry.  They didn't offer to wrap it up so that I could heat it up at home.  We won't go back.  Ever!The website malfunctioned, so my reservation was not properly received. My ride to the airport did not show up, leaving me to scramble for a plan B and nearly miss my flight. The customer-service agent assured me I'd receive a refund. After waiting several weeks, I contacted them again, and they denied my refund.First let me start by saying this is the worst process serving company in the valley.  My best friend needed to have some papers served against someone who has been harassing her. I located a service in Scottsdale AZ. I referred her to them because their website was very professional and when i talked to the man on the phone he was very nice and it seemed as if he would do a great job. My friend dropped the papers off on a Tuesday. they said that they would attempt 5 times. she wrote on the papers that the woman slept all day and to not do it in the morning. The company charged her the 75 dollars and said they would get it taken care of. Two days went by and no word, she called them to check on the status on Thursday and the people had JUST given the papers to a process server TWO days later!!! She then received an email a week later that two attempts had been made IN THE MORNING!!! She called and told them please dont serve her in the morning it does no good, the man stated they serve when they can. Another WEEK went by and she heard NOTHING from them. She called again to ask what was going on! the man was very rude and said they tried again and she didn't answer. She asked them how the process works and he said they didn't do special skills to trap her in to taking the papers. (in a rude manner) Needless to say these were not just papers that could sit around, she was being threatened and harassed. They supposedly attempted again to deliver them but who truly knows if they did. They honestly could have just sat on the papers and done nothing.  Another week went by and they emailed her papers back stating they could not serve her. This is the worst processing company ever. I have no clue why or how they are in business. They are extremely rude and have very poor manners. I feel horrible having referred them to her as she still after now, going on a month, still has the papers in her hand. I would give them ZERO stars if that was possible. Dont waste your money!!!!!!!AWFUL experience with Charlotte office. Band was not made correctly. I expressed concerns 2 times in person and 1 time on the phone. Was told it was supposed to move some. After my 3rd in office visit with a different person I was told they needed to remake it because it was not a good fit. AWFUL AWFUL experience. Offered a refund which I am STILL waiting on. Last appt was 7/30/12, was told refund would be mailed on 8/6.....Told on 8/17 after I requested information on my refund that it was mailed on 8/17. Hopefully I will get it....Been in Line for 15 minutes, they served two people. The barista is dressed like a thug, the cashier is walking around lost like it's his first day. Other complained of waiting for an hour. Nuff said.This Place is DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY all the time!!!! Lazy employees. Please hire someone other than a nineteen year old for the fast times.I purchased a $15.00 for $30.00 groupon. I went to redeem and purchased a 19.99 bouquet of roses and a 9.99 teddy bear, totaling 29.98. Making it a steal of a deal right? BUT WAIT!!!! They forgot to mention there is a $32.00 "service fee" Thus making my 19.99 roses a 45.00 dollar purchase. 60.00 if I didn't have the groupon. I wish I had read reviews first prior to purchase, that obviously would have been a great help!I cannot believe I let a sale on milk lure me into this dirty store again.  To prove that I'm not exaggerating the filth of this store, I took photos. Do you really want to eat anything that comes out of a case that is so incredibly gross?  I have no words to describe how grossed out I am after looking at the meat department. I looked because I was curious to know if they had solved the problems at the store.  I'm so repulsed, I wish that I didn't look!  

I stand by my previous comment......I would rather shop at Walmart than at Albertsons. Big fat fail!I can't understand why anyone would eat here.  I've been there 3 times and simply put this place is awful.  The potstickers are tasteless, but that is better than any of the noodle dishes.  Those noddles taste as if they were made from wallpaper glue.   
Totts Asian diner is right there and sooooo much better.  Yuphia thai is down the street as well.  Both are much better choices.As a rule I despise ALL junk food restaurants.  But when I'm hungry - and nobody's looking - I will stop at a Jack In The Box for their DFTs.  That's Dog Food Tacos, made with genuine Alpo, deep fried in a single unit without benefit of cheese.  The traditional JIB hot sauce (they used to call it Secret Sauce until the novelty wore off) always made their DFTs the best in the industry.  The good part is their DFTs haven't changed since I was little: they're still two for 99c, still generously greasy and still made with the best ingredients Alpo can supply for a meat-like substitute.

Last week I stopped at this store for my occasional half-dozen order of DFTs.  What I got were real, true-to-life tacos - plump, fresh, and made with real ground beef!  They were to die for!  I complimented the girl on their new quality.

Then, late last night, I snuck out (alone) to get a fix of DFTs.  Predictably, I got their usual grease-sodden DFTs and not the nice ones from last. week.

While waiting, I saw a big ad for something called a Sour Dough Jack.  The sandwich in the picture was fresh, healthy, and had slices of cheese, fresh bacon and a beef patty, so I asked if I could have one made like the one in the picture.  I tried to make it clear I did not want a sandwich that looked like a 300 # fat lady sat on it to keep it warm, and I didn't want it with any 3-day old bacon.  I was assured I could indeed, have that.

When I got home, I found last week's old bacon and the sandwich was typically squashed - nothing like the one in the picture.  I took it back and they agreed to re-make it properly.  That they did, and included a free milk shake because I just made a needless 7-mile round trip.

The replacement sandwich still had 3-day old bacon.  The bread, while looking like sourdough in appearance, just tasted like plain, ordinary sandwich bread.  The small beef patty was overcooked, dry and tasteless.  And this little hockey puck set me back almost $6.

This is why I avoid junk food joints: these slop-shops never take a lick of pride in anything they serve.  Their motto: 'Show great pictures but give them garbage.  Now, slop them hogs and send them on their way!'

UPDATE:

"Edgar E." of Mesa, AZ, writes in that he believes $6.00 is a small price to pay for a tiny, soggy sandwich.  

It's a free country, Edgar, and you're free to waste-away your wealth any way you wish.  And if it weren't for folks like "Edgar E." to support shoddy restaurants, we'd have NO crummy places to throw away our extra cash!  

And wouldn't that be a shame?I cannot begin to describe the level of incompetence at this office.

I have gone here, consistently, for 16 years - and would not return if they were the last office on earth.

Sparing you the GORY details...

Three appointments were scheduled at THEIR immediate request, only to be canceled NO MORE than 40 minutes prior to the appointment(s).

Their latest?  Come in today at 4:45.  Tomorrow is better for me.  No, today at 4:45.  4:20 pm my phone rings, "Uh, so, yeah, there is no ultrasound tech here or doctor so... you might not want to come."  What should I do instead?  Go to the ER?  That was their suggestion.  Go to the ER.  Why could I not have waited for the morning appointment that I ASKED FOR?!

They do not have ANYONE who can draw blood on site.  They hire a temp phlebotomist who would better be described as a vampire or they outsource your service.  Today their NP tried to draw blood on me.  She didn't know how to fill out the form, ASKED ME WHICH VIAL TO USE, and then said she couldn't get a vein in my arm that no one has EVER said that about before... ever.  

Let's not talk about my ultrasounds... I will just let you know that you probably don't want them anywhere near your nether regions with any sort of wand.

... Last but not least, "Here is the script I wrote you for _______.  I hope you're not allergic."

Uh, that was probably in my chart, lady.

Run.  Run for your lives and the lives of your unborn.

P.S.  If you want details, feel free to email me via Yelp.how this company has such great reviews is beyond me. i called and got two specific quotes for service and made an appointment for a specific time for the work to be done so that it could be done as quickly as possible. 5 hours after i dropped my vehicle off for my "scheduled" appointment it still hadn't been looked at. but the real issue is that the services that i got very clear quotes on were now more expensive. one by only $15 but the other by more than $100. i'm losing faith in yelp.This is the worst CVS pharmacy in the country. The staff is rude and they are extremely slow. Nothing is ever ready on time and if u have a question trust me it won't be answered correctly.I had high expectations but was let down. The quality of food was nothing special. For the price I paid, I could get much more food at restaurants that prepare from scratch. I felt ripped off after paying my bill.Went in to pick up my order and on my way out I heard one of the employees make a disparaging (racist?) remark.  I turned around and the two people (one of whom looked like a "manager") at the counter were laughing.  I went back in and asked if the comment was directed at me.  Both stopped laughing and said it wasn't, and that it was directed at one of them, which I suppose in their eyes made it okay.  I told them how inappropriate the comment was regardless, and left.  I emailed Pizza Hut with my complaint.Called in to place delivery order , person who answered must be new because she had absolutely no clue about the menu or prices, provided incorrect info about the price of toppings..  

I ordered a "CHICAGO DEEP" , waited about an hour and and was delivered a thin crust pizza,  driver said keep the pizza, took one bite and the crust was UNDER COOKED..  I called them and they sent me the deep dish I ordered and that too was very undercooked. Not enjoyable at all..


Can't give them even one star because the service and food sucked. Only plus would have been of that free thin crust I got was edible.  Ive ordered here before, don't know what happened to this place.. I'll go to le grande orange next time.My husband and I were exciited to try Rare Earth for the first time last night but when we walked up to the deck  there was a private party that had reserved the place. It was embarrassing to say the least. A sign at the bottom of the stairs would have been helpful.I used to work in east mesa and would frequently meet with friends for lunch at crackers and co.  

Let me start by saying this was over a year ago, but I never thought to write a review because we always called it "that place where the servers treat you like crap but has great food"

That pretty much sums things up, the food is AWESOME (salad are a must and Red Velvet cake will make you touch yourself) getting seated might take 10 minutes, water will take 15 and food probably about 45....maybe things have improved with a horriable economy?  Last straw for me was a BIG BLACK CURLY HAIR I pulled out of my cake one afternoon.  BAKED IN!!!!  

It pains me to even think of it still.  Patronize at your own risk!In 2010, I was moving out of town and thought I'd use my companies dental to replace my 20 year old silver filling that were cracked. I was quoted prices for the work and agreed to come back over a period of three weeks. During one of my visits I was told after the fact that I would need to pay extra for that visit because there was extra work that they hadn't anticipated. Well at that point what choice did I have but to pay. I then moved away and two month later I was sent a bill. When I called to find out why I was getting a bill since I'd already paid the agreed amount I was told it was for a miscalculation of what the insurance company would cover. So tell me do you think this is right?? Should I pay for a miscalcuation on the dental offices part. I paid THOUSANDS of dollars already!!! But I paid the bill, even though it rankled me that after receiving thousands of dollars from me and thousands of dollars from my insurance company I had to pay additional amounts in the office for "extra work" and now they had sent me a bill in another state for over a hundred dollars. At this point I was just glad that I wouldn't have to deal with some one that had done something so unclassy. But....the worst is yet to come. As I sat eating ice cream one night, I bit down on something chunky, my first thought was....a stray nut peice fell into this ice cream at the Ice cream factory!! But no, it was my filling. So less than 8 months after getting the filling it fell out of my mouth and I was able to spit out the gritty substance, this was July 13th. I called Dysart Dental the next day and I was pretty much accused of doing something to cause this filling to fall out, the office manager was condescending and obnoxious and Dr. Tracey Thomas (who did the majority of the work) never bothered to call me herself. I was lucky enough to be able to see a Practising Faculty Dentist at the University of Washington and get my filling fixed, after spending a couple of hundred dollars and was told that there was no adherence of the material to my tooth, he called it "bulk material failure", in other words I didn't do anything that made this filling fall out. The next day I flew out to my friends wedding. I let the office manager know what my cost was, send her the xray and bill via email, but I got an email back saying to have the dentist call them......I wrote back that they were welcome to call the dentist themselves but I know they never did and I never got a response or reimbursement. So bottom line, don't go there unless you want to have a dentist that isn't going to hold herself up to good standards, be accountable for her work or do the right thing for her customers. I also find it amusing that when I realized that I wasn't getting any satisfaction from dysart dental regarding the filling that fell out and realized they weren't going to attempt to rectify the situation I told them that I would just write a review about the experience, at the time there were no review posted, but I log on today and see reviews, all postive, interesting coincedence...makes you wonder. I plan to call my insurance company next to let them know about my experience and how the work was not only guranteed but how it to "be fixed" less than a year later.   Liked: Disliked:I will not be coming back anytime soon I ordered a cheeseburger and fries and it was just bad. The Fries were black and just gross looking and also made me sick. The burger was alright and was able to tolerate half. I'm a big bring it home even if it is for the dog and I wouldn't even do that. Their service was good slow but the man was very nice and accommodated the large party we had. Was really rooting for them but was just disappointed.  It was a $13 mistake.The staff here is extremely rude.  I had previously purchased a Groupon for a dog grooming and it didn't state on the Groupon that the vaccination record was required.  I even called the day before and they did not tell me his vaccination record was required.  

When I arrived the lady didn't want to take my dog and argued with me that the Groupon states to bring the vaccination.  I checked again and it does not!  I convinced her to take him and then I went back to drop off the shot record.  Overall I went there three times in one day.

They also wanted to make a photo copy of my ID.  Why is this needed if it's just a dog grooming?  Also, the Groupon did not state that the grooming was just for a dog wash and nail clipping.  I thought they cut his hair, but since I was already there I just let them groom him.  When I picked him up he looked exactly the same.  He was clean, but they didn't even brush his hair!  I won't refer this place or return.  There are many other dog groomers and vets with better service.

Don't come here unless you are OK with staff treating you like crap!My family loves IHOP... But how the hell you can run out of pancakes at a frickin IHOP!!!This place sucks.  No customer service skills, just a bunch of monkeys getting in your face hustling you.   One individual named bernard got in my face for no apparent reason.    No professionals here thats for sure.   Discount tire on the other hand are always there for ya.   And friendly.Although the food was delicious, we had some issues with customer service. We ordered a $70 bottle of wine. Pointed to it on the menu. When the bill came the bottle of wine we got was $115. We said we had an issue with the bill to our server he promptly sluffed us off to the manager who was bent on proving us wrong. She brought the bill along with the menu to show us what we received which was NOT the wine we ordered. We were adamant that we ordered a different wine by the same name which was less expensive. She wouldn't budge. Even after several times stating we did not order the more expensive variety she still would not budge. She ended up comping a drink but that did not nearly cover the almost $40 difference between the bottle we ordered and the bottle we received. Definitely feel as though it is the server's responsibility to clarify which bottle you are ordering if there are multiple bottles of the same brand. Left very frustrated.Be poor

That is the fremont street experience.I walked in with the intent of purchasing gloves and shoes. When I walked in I was greeted by the girl at the desk and everything was going well. The turning point was when I was looking at shoes, homie the clown comes up and asks if I need any help with any sizes. I said, "Yeah, do you have any more of sizes in this shoe?" and then he goes, "Oh, I was about to tell you that everything we have is on the floor and we don't have any in the back." I thought to myself, "Well then why the hell did you ask me if I needed help with sizes?" 

The tip of the iceberg began when he came back while I was trying on some shoes and I noticed the sign they had on the top shelf with regards to getting a free pair of Adidas Slips (the slip on sandal) with purchase of any AdiComfort shoe. Not realizing I had an AdiComfort shoe, I asked if that was applicable to the shoe I was considering purchasing or the more expensive shoes. He had NO CLUE what I was even referring to nor did he even know the answer. After realizing I had the shoe that the sign was talking about, I told him "Oh nevermind, it is this shoe." He took the sign down and asked his superior and came back to tell me that the special isn't in force or active and then proceded to tell me how "observant" as if that made it any better. I dismissed it and said I would be purchasing the shoes. After a minute, I thought about it and wondered why the hell, if you had the sign up, are you not going to honor it, or even offer me some sort of alternative?

At that point I decided I was not going to give my business to such poor customer service and bailed. 

Point of the review; go somewhere else.Just moved to Henderson and live walking distance to the Gin Mill. I thought this would be my new "cheers" bar and was excited when I first walked in. Went to the bar and sat there for about 20 mins without ever being greeted by any of the bartenders, even after making eye contact! Ended up walking out. Don't think I'll ever be back... even though it's sooo close to me!Takes forever to get your hotel.  I've taken other services that were the same price and faster.  Skip this oneAlways feeli like a number here and I cannot stand the electronic check in system they have. The PA I see here comes in for about a min then has an assistant to do the work. UGGGGGGGGGGI arrived fifteen minutes early. I was not seen until an hour and a half after my appt time. I walked in after a lady. She left I still was not seen until twenty minutes after she left. The office was clean, service in my opinion was poor.WOW. Never again.... I must say, this is the worst I have ever been treated in a restaruant. 

We were in the Target shopping center this evening, and where hungry. The fiesta is close..Why not? Mexican sounds good...Why not?

Well, 'Why not' yourself down to Sunset Station's Mexican restaurant, or to Chipotle. Or chevy's in the mall. Save yourself.

First off.
The chips. Even though it says "ala carte" chips and salsa are $3.99, they are on the buffet. There seems to be a triage of colored chips...go for the lightest ones. They don't have a revolting burnt taste to them. Salsas were okay. The green one was one of the better ones.. even though I didn't mind the one that our "server's assistant" brought out originally.

We ordered waters, and I ordered a Pineapple Mojito. 
The waters came...with about 3 ice cubes in the glasses. We were told that the restaurant was "running low" on several things (if that included ice, I am not sure), when we asked for an extra glass of it.

The first time we saw our waitress, she told us that a burrito and the fajitas were good. My guy asked if they had "corn cakes", and the waitress looked at us like we were from another country, before saying no. I asked which type of fish was in their fish tacos....tilapia (ick) and that it was frozen ((double ick.)) I went with the carintas tacos, and my guy went for the steak fajitas.

While waiting for our food, and my mojito........Our waitress never stopped by. Neither did her assistant. We were missing napkins, and silverware.. Finally, a manager, dropped off wrapped silverware in cloth napkins three feet from our table. She and I made eye contact, and I waved, she smiled and started to walk away. I then throw in more violent waves to get her to come over, so we could have some napkins, and eating utensils.

Servers who were with other tables, were quite attentive to their customers. We didn't even get our lady's name. Still waiting for our food, and attention.....and my drink.

A server/busser comes over with a tray, that isn't sizzling...so we know it's not ours. He attempts to drop it off, and we decline it.

seven minutes before our food comes, a hostess comes by with my mojito.

NOT WORTH THE WAIT. It was disgusting. watered down. A fake pineapple taste. We both had a sip of it and winced. The manager who gave us the silverware told us that our food should be any minute, and that "it takes a long time." I sent her off with the mojito. Not impressed.

Finally, our food came. My carnitas were dry. I slathered them in salsa to make them worth it...Normally, I would have sent them back... but I was famished.

The guacamole was slightly brown, and looked like it had been stored in a ziplock. The beans, had no seasoning. Tasted 'fresh' out of a can, and just thrown onto the plate. The steak for the fajitas had no flavor. No seasoning. Not even salt. The rice was good.

The second time we saw the waitress was her asking us if we needed anything. We said no.
And asked for the check. The bus boy came by to clear our plates, and we asked to see a manager.......who walked by us after we had asked for her.

When the manager came by, we told her how disappointed we were in the food, and in the service. We had seen our waitress twice, and the food was poor. She told us that she would have a talk with the server, and "see" what she could do....


She offered us free dessert, or dessert to go....we told her that we just wanted to leave. We had already asked for the check, and were STILL waiting on it.

Well, she must of talked to the server alright, because she came back, in a NOTICEABLY rude attitude when she brought our check. Like a toddler about to throw a tantrum because she just got tattled on.

Walking out, she felt the need to give us a dirty look while she said "thanks," and "goodbye".


NO THANKS. PASS ON THIS ONE.I always order the adobo fried rice omelet and spam musubi when I come here. The food is great but my experience here the past few times have been TERRIBLE. 

They are always busy and understaffed. I placed a to go order and waited over 40 minutes. Because they're so busy, the waitresses mix up the orders and give someone's order to a different table. 

Even when you call an order in, you still have to wait over 20 minutes for the food to be done. 

I do NOT  recommend coming to this location. They have a location close to the galleria mall which has better service and the food is just a good.I have avoided this place for a long time because of price.  I always go to Hot Dog Heaven because they have the best prices on this side of town and they are always consistent.  

BUT this review is not about them...I decided to try this place again last night and was very disappointed.  The service was good but here were the issues:

1. Biggest issue, I was told I could not just order a hot dog by itself.  I wanted just 2 dogs by themselves.  I was FORCED to either get 2 dogs with fries or 2 dogs with a drink at a cost of over $9.00

2.  The buns were not kept in a warmer so they were cold and the pickle was so cold it made the dogs cold.

3.  Very little seaseme seeds only on top so the buns are not the same as a traditional dog.

At Hot Dog Heaven which I will go to today, you can get a dog for about $2.75 without being forced to purchase anything else.  At the place above I was told that a hot dog with fries which is close to $6.00 that the only thing he can do is take .50 off which still makes a dog twice as much as a dog at hot dog heaven.

Being from Chicago I really wanted this place to be successful because it is close to where I live but over the years, the prices keep going up and the frills keep going down....sorry but never again for me at this place...I've been here a few times and as much as the service is always awesome. I can't forgive them for what happened. 

It was a beautiful day so the boyfriend and I decided to take the motorcycles out. We decided to stop by Home Plate. The previous times I've had the breakfast and you can never go wrong with breakfast any time of the day. But we felt like pasta and decided on the spaghetti and meatballs for lunch. Boyfriend decided to start with the shrimp. It was overly seasoned so we sent it back. The spaghetti sauce was also overly seasoned with pepper. But at that point I was hungry and just finished what I could. Plus we had plans for the ride and we didn't want to waste the day. 

Later that afternoon while riding near Boulder Highway I all of a sudden needed to use the restroom. I thought it was just me so I didn't think anything of it. But when boyfriend started to have stomach pains also we put two and two together and found the culprit. 

Our nice afternoon out on the bikes was cut short as we both raced back home. We will never be back.The manager during the shift this morning seemed rather rude to one of his employees, an older man who looked like he was still learning, and the manager had little to no patience, constantly snapped at him and was also rushing ME to the point where I felt uncomfortable even asking for ketchup. And I was only given ONE napkin inside my utensil packet. Only came here because it's right beside the school, otherwise, I'd have gone elsewhere.Ripped off today.  I ordered a couple of sandwiches, including a steak and cheese, my favorite.  So after 16 mins I realize something's wrong, especially after everyone but one person who ordered after me has left the place or are eating their meal.  My wife who is facing the counter says, the counter girl just asked about a steak and cheese.  So I get up and they magically are wrapping up my sandwich.   

I sit down and there is so little meat it's not right.  Given that they were just wrapping and the bread was cold (i.e. no heat dissipation), leads me to believe my order was lost/forgotten.  They just scrapped some steak from another order and quickly wrapped it up.   The counter person knew I was annoyed at waiting so it's not that they didn't have an opportunity to correct.

Needless to say a very bad survey and this Yelp.  Employees need to know or be taught how to handle errors and address them, not how to hide it and piss off a customer with a Yelp account.Been going there for years.  If you can find someone else I say go there, horrible office staff no one gets back to you on tests results.  Will hope to find someone new in 2012.  Waiting time is terrible usually an hour and half no matter what time I get there.  Looking for someone on the southwest  

LauraI only wish I could give zero stars. Or negative stars. Upon acceleration, the car jerks. Like it's having a hard time finding the gear. I take it in a few days after Christmas. Lest we not forget, I also have the extended warranty which I pay $90 a month for. My expedition is 6 years old and I thought getting this coverage would be beneficial as I'm sure the repairs are quite expensive. So, they tell me the car needs a tune up. Which of course is not covered. They tell me this tune up package is going to be about $980. Wow. I tell the guy, Christmas was like 4 days ago. How about we just fix the jerking problem and forego this whole package. Oh but fixing the jerking problem will be even more--hundreds more. You've got to be kidding me. But I'm like a freaking hostage here so what can I do? I agree. They call me on 12/31 and tell us we can pick it up after 12. Fine. We get there at 2:30 just to find out they closed at 2 for the holiday. That's funny, that wasn't mentioned on the voice mail message that said the car would be ready after 12. They didn't say after 12 but before 2. So that pissed me off. And then when we finally do pick it up, the jerk face "service advisor" says "oh the repairs came in lower than I quoted...I said $980, but I got it down to $960". Oh wow! I'm so grateful that all I wanna do is punch you in the face! Seriously, he acted like he turned holy water into wine. What a douche. I won't go back to this place. Ever. I know these dealers are all the same but it's like they go out of their way to make it an awful experience. I usually bring it to Ford Country...those guys aren't as douchey.HoRriBLe experience. First, arriving in Las Vegas on a Thursday morning and I had at least a 35 minute wait in line. Famished by the time we were done but trusted the agent was assigning us the right car when he confirmed "Mid Size car right?" When we picked up our Chevy COBALT, I was disappointed with its size but too famished to consider if we were getting ripped off, I was even more disappointed when we tried to leave and we were told to go back and find the right car. Our car was parked in the WRONG SLOT. The rental process was a 1-1/2 hour process! Driving around Vegas with friends who ALSO received a COBALT from Dollar at HALF the price, confirmed it was a COMPACT car - not a mid-size. Called Budget Customer Service (National #) and they confirmed it was a COMPACT car but only offered a 10% discount-received no apology and it became obvious they bait-and-switch as common practice. They requested we resolve it at the counter (great-THAT counter) when we return the car. Called back customer service the next day to resolve our reimbursement over of the phone instead and the agent couldn't find my car per the Contract # this time. Her severely broken English and unhelpful mindset made it impossible for her to locate our contract (didn't even ask for our name at any point) but insisted we find some RA # that didn't exist. Had to resolve the discount after returning the car but went to the Fastbreak counter and waited my 15 minutes. The guy gave me my 10% discount but also tried to make me feel like he did me a favor by telling me "your car is 1 hour late but I removed the charge." Oh yeah - after the 1-1/2 hour start - he better!I made an appointment at 2. The guy went and got McDonald's and sat there and ate his food instead of working on my car. I understand if you're busy.  But there were two guys working. One guy was already working on one car. So why wasn't the other guy working on mine? What's the point of an appointment.Horrible service. Pizza was blah and not worth the 50 minute wait for a thin crust.Nice hotel for young people bad experience, dealers were rude made sexual comments about my wife, the operator when i called wouldnt look up my reservation, the food at koi was a joke, Worst Hotel I have stayed in and I go to vegas a lot, dont waste your moneyFor a $400 dinner for four, I expect service to be pretty remarkable. Yet service at this overrated, on-the-canal-in-the-Venetian restaurant was so inattentive it was nonexistent. 

Our starters arrived before our cocktails. 
Our wine arrived halfway through our dinners (I believe he forgot it.)
Our check didn't arrive until we flagged down our waiter.

The food? All right. I live in Chicago - a city with hundreds of palate-pleasing eateries - and I've had better Italian down the road from my apartment. The standout was the caprese salad - the mozzarella had an almost air-like mouthfeel. Very nice. Other than that - overpriced seafood (shrimp and lobster) that bordered on chewy and bland. 

Many people rave about Zeffirino's lunch prix fixe menu - if that's where the value and experience lay, then so be it. But for dinner - I wouldn't take anyone back here. I've had better service at a Denny's.bad attitude along with bad service.Koi is decent sushi with a bit of variety, and something I enjoy often.

Just don't go to this location! There's a mandatory gratuity, so the staff loves to be slow, and rude. Good luck on getting your drinks refilled, or even seeing that snappy old lady in a kimono crack a smile!

I cannot emphasize enough that everyone who works here is a ****ing jerk. They seem to get away with it because there aren't really any other sushi bars in the area. I don't care that I have to travel almost ten miles to eat at another Koi, I'm never going to this place again!

And neither should you.Was seated and waited 15 minutes before a waiter came to my table. Poor customer services can't understand how they stay in business.The customer service its good, but, they burn the ends of my hair after i spend 250, now i have to spend more  money on repairing my hair.I can't believe people actually choose to come here.  I came out of necessity.  And I don't plan on going back.

The system that they have is ridiculous....one guy takes down your name and order and passes it on.  The next person prepares your order.  And another person rings you up.  Then you sit and wait as all the people behind you get their bagels first.  I think "plain bagel toasted with cream cheese" threw them for a loop.  I mean why not get Dutch apple with walnut honey cream cheese?  If you want a pastry go to a bakery, not a bagel shop.

Anyways, seeing as everyone was clamoring for them I thought that maybe I would be getting a good bagel.  It was truly awful.  It was so mushy and chewy...there was no nice crisp outside.  There was no yummy fluffy inside.  It was just round chewy bread.I tried really hard to like this place. I can honestly say the waiter was the only redeeming aspect of our meal.

We ordered the shrimp brioche - don't bother. They are drowning in BBQ sauce so everything else is pointless.  You could be eating packing styrofoam.

Atmosphere - the management let children run crazy through the restaurant and when  I asked the waiter, I was told there was nothing they could do for fear of being fired.  So instead, they poison the experience rather than ask the family to exert control over their children.  Appalling.

I ordered the salmon and it was very disappointing.  It was supposed to be cooked in lemon butter and the fish is old. All I tasted was the char on the grill.

My colleague ordered the jerk chicken on sweet potato.  Thankfully he asked for the honey on the side.  The chicken was peppered not jerked and peppered to the point of inedibility.

The restaurant is a 70's reject in desperate need of updating starting with the nasty menus and the ancient carpeting.I don't get how this place can average 4 Stars. (as of today, anyway) One thing I can say for sure is that this place is NOT "The Place" to go. We  sit down and the table was "dirty", covered in salt and crumbs. I had to wipe down the table myself. We order drinks and my tea comes in a "dirty" glass with lip stick on it. GROSS!!!! I look around and see food and dirty napkins on the floor. At this point, I'm thinking WE NEED TO LEAVE! However, my husband says lets just stay. Our food comes and its not good. We had lunch items. So, maybe they are known for their breakfast and that it what we should have ordered. I took two bites and was done. We spent $30, left hungry and went to another restaurant. If the place wasn't so dirty, maybe I would have gone back to try the breakfast.My boyfriend and I just wanted somewhere to eat and we didn't know this was more of a dive bar.  We don't really care for beer, so we didn't have any.  When we first got there our hostess sat us at a dirty table.  The menu was dirty as well and there was no menu for beer (which seemed to be their highlight).  Our waitress was the worst of the night.  She had no personality, was rude and didn't understand humor.  All the workers, excpet one, I believe the owner, had no energy.  They looked unhappy and really uncustomer service friendly.  There was also a gross bathroom smell near where we sat in the booth.  Well, past that our food looked good, but tasted pretty much flavorless.  It wasn't really worth the money we paid for it.  We were ignored mostly and any refill, ketchup request seemed like it was too hard of a task.  Learn the hell to smile!  We were so uncomfortable there!  Terrible terrible times more terrible!Had The #62 Carne Asada Tacos. Ewww so freaky greasy, I picked it up and the tortilla fell apart from it being so soft from the grease. The rice had no flavor what so ever. The beans were ehh. The chips were flavorless. I don't know who is cooking this food but it's definitely not mexican food. NO BUENO!!!!I wish right now I had zero stars for this overpriced fool you into the web of sweet cream!!! I should of looked at my YELP application on my i-phone before being lured over by a "free taste". Dirty four letter word: FREE. My A$$ FREE with two small double scoops being $36. WTF? No way was I or my hubby going to pay that. We walked away with them paying for being such scammers. I understand I was in a tourist trap high end shops type of mall, but come on ICE CREAM/Gelato being more bucks then the booze slushy? At least with the booze slushy I have a nice buzz!!! 
DO NOT BE THE LICKER of the moment for these CIty Slickers of  ripping you off.My son and I were downtown and I decided to introduce him to Mrs. Whites, a place I had not been to in several decades. We ordered the fried chicken and the pork chops. We never got any cornbread. I got maccaroni rather than the requested rice and gravy. The photos on the menu implied a pair of bone in chops rather than the boneless pieces of dry pork loin in a flavorless crust I was served, one at a time. The fried chicken was inconsistent in that some parts were rare and others overcooked! Finally we were charged an additional 70 cents for the luxury of using a credit card. So the meal was $13 a plate plus two and change each for weak sweet tea and lemonade. The biggest waste of $38 in recent memory. The servers were surly and disinterested. Mrs. White would be embarrassed at what has transpired since her departure. 
I long for the days in the 70's when Lucille's Soul Food Cafe was on Washington with her 'real deal' oxtails and genuinely delicious food. This place is the WORST!For our first meal in Vegas we thought we'd try Diablo's as it was one of the places in our hotel, the Monte Carlo Resort. There were 4 of us, 2 couples. Upon finding the first "hostess" she pointed us outside to the "other hostess." Between the two of them they passed us back and forth before the "outside" girl finally put us next in line for a table, approx. 10-15 minutes. We noticed a table for 4 empty, so we figured we'd be seated soon. Next thing we know, a group of 6 and then after that a couple came into the restaurant and were seated right away, while we were still holding onto the pager waiting our turn. It was at that point that we left, it was clear that they were discriminating against us, either because they could tell we were lesbians or we were not "girly" enough or didn't have men on our arms. Get over it, it's 2012. After reading the reviews we are thankful we didn't eat there. We had much better fare over at the Sporting House Bar & Grill.too expensive... food is gross.... no thanks.Attended this show a few weeks ago with my husband. To call it burlesque (x or not) is a stretch. Had I not gone in expecting a sexy variety type show, high spirited, drama, parody... maybe I would not have been disappointed. Nah, who am I kidding. The show was substandard. The seating was poorly arranged and uncomfortable. The show called for a 2 drink minimum, but our waitress did not arrive until the last 15 minutes of the show.  Some of the dancers looked bored, choreography missed the mark, and the expected curves of burlesque dancers were missing. Time and money would have been better spent someplace else!服务态度太差，每个服务员都像吵架一样跟客人说话。过桥米线也不正宗，其他的菜，水煮鱼的鱼肉少的可怜，羊排锅的羊排都用剔完的骨头来糊弄客人，没有多少肉！米饭吃着也有的地方硬了，还有一股味道，一吃就知道是隔夜的。吃过最差的中餐馆，the worst chinese restaurant ever!Mind you - if my fiance could pick his last meal, it would be a torta - hands down.

Los Reyes de la Torta?  

Overhyped and under delivered.

We ordered to go, so maybe if we actually ate there, it would've been better?  Regardless, that shouldn't be the case anyway.  The food was horrible.

We ordered the Tortas Del Rey.  The thing is huge, I'll give them that.  BUT it was DRY and lacked flavor.  It had all the bells and whistles.  Unfortunately, the last time I checked bells and whistles (as well as the kitchen sink) don't have flavor.  Neither did this torta. 

My fiance is Mexican, and well- we know what a torta should taste like.  This was nowhere close to that.  Not even reaching substandard levels.  

Came with chips.  It was to go, so why do they pack the chips in the same container with the hot torta.  Soggy chips!  Yeay, what a treat.  

I ordered their king porkchop.  The spice was definitely there, but that was it.  Just a burning sensation in your mouth.  No other flavor.  The porkchop was dry as can be and severely overcooked.  It was like eating cardboard.  Rice and beans weren't seasoned.  Seriously?  

And service?  Abysmal.  These girls working the front counter and "serving" have got a lot to learn.  

What a disappointment.Abysmal and outdated accommodations, weak service and completely overpriced. Massive fail.Will not return. All you can eat at its WORST!! stay away. they have no idea about cleaning in this place. Check out they're recent health inspections no wonder we got sick!!!
http://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/restaurants/inspections.phpI went here with my heart set on a veggie cheesesteak and you were out.  I was told by the sandwich jockey that it is "a very popular sandwich."  Well, if you are aware of this, then why not order/stock more?  It is either in refrigerated or frozen vacuum-sealed packs (yes, I have seen you prepare it before), so that tells me that it has a decent shelf life... so keep it in stock!

My second choice was an eggplant parm sandwich, until you told me the marinara sauce has meatballs in it... what?  Please consider the vegetarians and don't have the meat in the red sauce.  It is extremely easy to keep meatballs separate from marinara sauce, and just sauce the meatballs as needed.

I am so disappointed in Capriotti's Red Rock!!!!The garlic tomato sauce that comes with the bread is the only good thing there.  The soup tastes like it came from a bag, and the marinara sauce on my pasta and chicken was disgusting. It was sour, and upset my stomach. My mom had the cheese ravioli, which was actually pretty good, but the service here BLOWS! We complained about the sauce to which the response was, "yeah, they make it sour here..." Sucks, sucks, sucks.This place was over priced and just not very good.  There were 5 of us and only person liked their meal (and now I can't remember what it was!) If you are in San Tan...go somewhere else!Absolutely Horrific
May 16, 2009 - On a busy Friday night, we needed some food and did not want to do the waiting for a table deal at some of the nicer restaurants in the Rio Hotel and Casino. 

We happend by the Rub BBQ, and we should have known better just by the horribly tacky theme chopper motorcycle in the entrance, equipped with a BBQ smoker sidecar. Even diehard rednecks would think this is as lame as it gets.

Okay, we order from the terribly dog-eared and worn out menus in an atmosphere that could be best described as " cardboard factory lunchroom" decor.

We order from the menu, Baby Back ribs and the fixings.

Oh lord, thats when it got even worse. Poor service, wrong beverages delivered, and then came the food.

This was the absolute worst "BBQ food" I have ever eaten in my life, and that includes greasy food prepared 200 miles off-shore on an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico. 

Let's see, Baby Back ribs: Well, not any form of a rack that I could determine, as the ribs were all individually sliced and detached, in perfectly sliced (Read: cut while cold and reheated), or they just happen to posses a kitchen lazer beam that slices slow cooked pork to the thousands of an inch in straightness.

But then, I am implying slow cooked goodness, which this was not even close, as the overwheming and sickening flavor of liquid smoke was permeated into the meat and (or complete lack thereof) BBQ sauce.

Hey, that would be bad enough, but that would be taking for granted these were actually Baby Back ribs. They were not! They were actually the smaller lengths of the Pork Ribs they offer on their menu, and what was even more disturbing was the fact the 6-7 ribs we were served did not even match each other in cooking color, length and overall appearance. 

Nice.....a grab bag of ribs. Leftovers? Uh huh.

Then comes the sides, lets describe the eternal BBQ favorite, baked beans: We will just say they should be called " A whole bottle of Liquid Smoke in Bush's Baked Beans". Nuff said, ineatable.

French fries, not bad, not good....lots of salt, PASS THE KETCHUP please.

BBQ Sauce presented at the table?? Clearly UN MARKED as to variety, spices, etc. The silk screening was work off the platic bottles, from what I hope was hot water cleaning. I think I overestimate the cleaning part of the equasion. Thats okay, they were all near empty anyway.

But here is the kicker, (now mind you we all had 1 call or well mixed adult beverage with dinner) THE BILL.$80.00. 

Yep, EIGHTY DOLLARS for complete shit, and I do mean SHIT. 

Nice thing though, the next day I got to revisit the experience in my bathroom, as it seems RUB BBQ does not know very much about clean and fresh food products or food handling. Thank god for extra soft Charmin.

The waitress was okay, just barely. We tipped the normal 20% that DECENT HUMANS give as a gratuity, but they actually all deserved to be kicked suare in the nuts for placing that rubbish in front of paying customers.

I'm sure the owner of this dump lives in Maryland or New York City, a real hotbed of smoked BBQ food activity, and he or she swings by the Las Vegas store on the way to the VIP suite on the 50th floor of the Rio Hotel, just spending enough time on premises to pat everyone on the back and say "Good Job!!!".If you value a healthy gastrointestinal tract and actual good food value, NEVER eat at "Rub BBQ". 

(I cut and paste from another site, before I noted that YES, this dump is actually based in NY City. Go figure, called that one correctly. What a joke.)Hey now, let's watch that young energetic staff at Fakefathers dump those "great" fries out of their respective bags into the oil (that includes the sweet potato variety). Now, let's watch the cook take inferior meat that has already been chopped up and is waiting in bins and dump it onto the grill with the pre-cut and measured onions and peppers and voila your sandwich is ready in 2.5 minutes. I want my freakin steak to start red and get cooked on the grill you idiots.  Ok, now let's pay $8 for a tiny sandwich that uses SIRLOIN steak, not ribeye and be happy about life. Nah, let's just call this place what it is:  a ripoff, a place that uses cheap ingredients to make a profit on the poor customers of Phoenix, who don't ask questions and assume because they throw alot of cheap meat into the bun, it must be worth the price. 
    Some folks take cheesesteak seriously and no lazy establishment is getting my cash these days. There was nothing to these sandwiches. no flavor and using sirloin is basically the equivalent of buying a pack of Steak-umm's and making these yourself at home. Garbage, overpriced cheap steak and frozen potatoes....enjoy your meal at FAKEfathers.It is not worth the money,on top of that the waiter spilled the wine on the table and on my brand new white shirt without even apologize the general manager comes by gives me his card and say go buy a shirt and bring me a receipt and I will take care of it ,next day we went bought a shirt and he wouldn't pay.For the first time in my entire life, I instructed my party NOT to leave a tip and they reacted by counting out COINS so that we could pay the bill for this would-be meal and ensure that the wait staff was aware that we hadn't forgotten a tip, but simply that they had not earned one from us.

We had a party of four meeting up at this location to grab a quick bite before our movie began at 7:00.  Two of us showed up first and were brought to our seats.  An older gentleman came up to our table and asked for our drink orders...and then a younger gentleman came up a minute later for our drink orders.  I informed him that we had already been helped and thanked him.  After a few minutes, our original server brought out our drinks and a basket of tortilla chips with a tray or salsa, bean dip and guacamole to munch on.  This is one of the things I love about Mexican food restaurants, it's their version of a bread basket and it works so well, for me, because I love salsa and chips.

After about ten more minutes, another of our party showed up and the same thing happened as before.  Older gentlemen gets her drink order and then the younger one does the same thing.  I'm curious, are they really so overstaffed that they need two people to check up on each other or are they just unaware of which sections each is supposed to cover?  No matter, since we were splitting the bill and crunched for time (and our fourth party was stuck in traffic), we order two appetizers to split.  

After we ordered, my best friend noticed that our salsa, bean dip and guacamole was almost empty and the older gentleman was at our table so she asked him to send us a new one.  He looked directly at her as she made the request and then just turned around and walked away.  She gave his retreating back a funny look and then noticed that the younger gentleman was about to pass our table and stopped him for the same request.  He got a very nervous looks on his face, shook his head and informed us that this wasn't his section and he'd send our server over.  Really?  Then why were you asking for our drink orders and serving the two tables to the left and right of us?

The older server came out with his stern face in place and snidely informed my best friend that only the first bowl of salsa and dip is free, afterwards he would have to charge us $7.95.  Just so that everybody is aware, that's the price of an appetizer at this location.  My friend literally laughed at him and waved him away after I had informed him that this would be our once and only visit to this restaurant.  It amazes me that $7.95 is worth the loss of what might have been a repeat customer.

After we ate, the older server handed us our bill of $25.30 and my two companions literally counted out 25 dollars and three dimes while I wrote on the note that they should be on the lookout for my upcoming one star yelp review and that the service was so horrible that I would not be back.  Three servers saw that I was writing on the bill and pointed us out in front of the restaurant while they whispered vehemently about us.  To top everything off, the server came and snatched up what we had left before we were even out of the booth and gave us a cold sneer for our "generosity."  

It's actually a crying shame that I won't be back to this restaurant, especially in a town like Las Vegas where there can't be that many more Mexican food restaurants that would be willing to bestow decent service on a paying customer...right?Ordered for delivery, bill was $10 more than what I ordered. When I asked the driver why it was $ 24 when I ordered 2 $6 lunch specials? The driver told me "because of gas"! Ummm no! You go now, I buy your food no more! Then the owner called and wanted to yell at me. Great customer service!Went to San Felipes tonight and will never go back! At first we were told we could not sit outside, it would be a 10 minute wait because the waitress needed to catch up. Isn't that why you have a manager?! When we got seated we waited 20 minutes just for a waitress for our drinks and then another 20 minutes just to order food. When we finally got our food it was cold and barely edible. Our waitress then tabbed out with us and handed us over to another waitress who took one order and forgot we were there. After having to go to the front desk and ask for a waitress twice finally went to the bar and asked for our check! We are business owners and would never treat our clients like this. To top it all off the Manager was so busy talking to his friend at the table next to us as he watched us trying to get service, not once did he come over to help us. Even as we sat with our hands raised above our heads just to get someone's attention.Really?! You would think with what little money people have today to go out, you would treat them so that they would want to come back. Find a new staff who actually wants to work!Word of advice stay away from this walmart. First off the check out line wait is like 30minutes. Then nothing is put in the right spot then all the worker seems upset to help you.

Its crazy and just the ppl there in general are crazy. Just walking to the store ppl ask you for money or try to sell you something. Crazy crazy place.Service and food was very slow. Messed up my order twice. My sons birthday and they forgot the cake. Nobody enjoyed... Overall...sucks!On their door and on yelp its stated its open till 9 on sat. We got there at 8:15 and it was locked and the guy who was working the place didn't even respond to us standing outside.I ate there tonight, and I can certainly say I was less than happy with the restaurant in general. 
When we walked I'm there was no one to great us. So we waited, come to find out that we ha to wait because they were understaffed. With two maybe three waiters. It wasn't a slow night an there were four of us. We were sat at a table that had yet to be cleaned. When our food came we still had yet to be given silverware.

I ordered the stacked enchiladas - red chili 
With an egg $15 plate. Not expensive but I certainly expect a decent mean. The red chili was horrible. They claim "New Mexico" styled Mexican cuisine. I travel to New Mexico often and in comparison I felt like I was eating at just another sheik city Mexican restaurant where the white people who don't know the difference eat. 

I give the restraint the single star, because I had a great server an when I told him that the meal was less than satisfactory, he had taken the meal off the check.This place actually deserves ZERO stars, but Yelp makes me give them at least one.  I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED SO HORRIBLY IN MY LIFE!!! THIS PLACE HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!  I don't usually type in all caps like the above sentences, but that was all I could do to express how horrible the customer service was.  My boyfriend and I went in for some pizza.  I will say it was about 1:30 am on a Friday night.  I say this because I see others have mentioned how poorly they were treated late night as well.  We asked for 3 slices of cheese pizza with jalapenos. There were only 2 pieces of cheese left (everything else had meat =(...) so we quickly ordered a veggie for our 3rd slice since the lady at the register was very quickly getting irritated and impatient..  Literally right after paying we walked to the side to wait and turned back and saw a fresh cheese pizza that had come out from the back.  We quickly asked the lady at the register if we could change the veggie we had ordered for a slice of cheese.  She refused to exchange one slice of cheese pizza.  Another employee who was boxing the pizza up for us tried to change out the slices for us, and she yelled at him for trying to do so.  In my past experiences if a customer asks for a pizza that isn't out on the counter, they would go and check how much longer until it was ready.  This was not the case here.  I could understand if there was some long line out the door, but since it was before 2 am we were the only ones in there at the time.  I cannot express how poorly we were treated.  I will never go here again.  I would rather deal with the long lines at Joe's than the horrible customer service here even if there was no wait.One of the worst places for overpriced pizza or subs! Don't waste your money. 

Crusty/toasted probably day old small roll for a sandwich with 2 slices of meat and 1 slice of american cheese for $8. Slice of pizza was over $3 and medium drink was $2 (one refill allowed). 

Nothing tasted authentic or worth another visit.Went back to see if they got their act together...not. Gumbo was shockingly average coming from a chef that embraces his New Orleans background. Service was slow....really slow.  Truffled mac and cheese was decent. But the food is very average, when I go out I want to eat better than what I can prepare quickly at home. Especially if I am to wait (most of the wait was after the meal to get the check, maybe 15-20 minutes..inexcusable at a non-busy restaurant at lunch time)Tempe Animal Hospital.  Baseline Animal Clinic.  

Though it is a clean place with a nice staff, I too feel, like the many other reviews below, like they are ripping me off.  I've taken my dog there 5 or 6 times, but this is the last.  They guilt you into feeling like you should be paying $500 for multiple tests (urine, blood, stool) all at once, instead of trying perhaps one test at a time or really trying to diagnose the problem.  They don't talk about the issues in the room with you, but go out and work-up an estimate and bring it back in, like your dog is a car or something.  No other vet I've been to behaves this greedily.  I don't feel guilty for going to another vet who charges me less, works with me to find a cure and doesn't inflate their prices.This restaurant doesn't deserve even One star. They have the WORST serving staff, they don't even check back with you until they give you the check to pay them. They are also rude with an attitude. The sushi is WAY Overpriced for the amount and quality you get. It's the worst sushi place I've ever been to in Old Town Scottsdale. Its not even authentic. I would recommend going to RA or Kona Grill over this place; and that's not giving them a compliment either. Very disappointed.I have been to this place recently. I was highly disappointed. The food took 30 minutes to get. When we finally got our food it was cold. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone in the Chandler area.Took my car in for hand wash. It sat in the back for 30 plus mins without anyone even spray water on it. I asked to speak with the manager about the delay (which now it's 45 mins later).  Instead of telling me the truth that they are short handed, George (the man who is suppose to be in charge at that time) gave me a load of BS about the car wasn't wash right the first time so it has to be rewash. That was the biggest BS I have ever heard. I stood at the window and watch the car for over 30 mins and it hasn't even been moved since it was parked. And George has been sitting in the office on his "brain" and haven't even got out of his chair until I ask to see the manager. With all that said, the staff that dry and detail the cars are working hard outside in the upper 90 temp. They do good work but the management team . . . If I am the general manager, I will be looking for some new people who do more work, provide good customer service and less BS.Not impressed... Eaten there several times and each time I think it might be better the next time, not the case... Its more of a tourist trap style cooking... That being said the outdoor area is great but drink cost is high... If you have family in from out of town its cute to check out and take pictures. Two thumbs down on dining, two thumbs down on drink prices, and one thumb up for atmosphere if they decide to stay open past 10pm on some night...Salad was served with egg including parts of shell. Expensive restaurant in a mediocre hotel/casinoI'm not walking into a club where they wand you, pat you down, and then charge you a $10 cover for an empty bar!  Still searching for that perfect place to go dancing...Wish there was a 0 star option. I would say this had to be the worst service I have ever received, but that would mean I actually received service. My wife and I came in and were told to seat ourselves anywhere we like. Once we seated ourselves, we waited about 5 minutes before receiving menus at which point we requested waters. We received our water orders promptly. We sorted out what we wanted to order and put out menus down - we then waited almost 20 minutes - no one came by for our order. During this time we saw the waiter come by several times and assist those who came in after us. It was quiet and very empty at the time (early afternoon) and there were only 3 other couples in the entire restaurant. There were at least two waiters just standing around and the third made rounds by us a few times and even noticed us try to flag him down - but never came by. After 25 minutes of waiting for someone to take our order we decided to leave and as we walked out, the two waiters standing by the door just smiled smugly and said "have a nice day" as we walked out. It seems they were waiting for us to give up and leave on our own. We're not very vocal or confrontational people so they got no lip out of us unfortunately. Aside from this, the place is cozy looking, quiet, clean and easy to find and access. The people working there were the rudest I have ever met though and we were very excited to try a place.I am incredibly surprised this place has a 4 star rating. I recently moved to the area and drive by here quite a bit so after checking yelp decided to give it a try on a random week night. It was pretty dead and the waitress was nice enough but completely forgot our appetizer, which we had to ask to have removed from our bill (we figured we wouldn't bother with it since we had already been served our entrees). I got the Singapore noodles with chicken and was incredibly disappointed. It was disgustingly salty, even after drenching it in Siracha I still couldn't eat it. My fiance got the Teppanyaki beef and yakisoba which was not in fact yakisoba (yea, I know the difference). Not every Asian noodle is the same people! He could at least stomach his meal. I ended up grabbing something at Fry's on our way home so I wouldn't go hungry for the evening.Sigh.. This restaurant may be the very reason why I never eat shrimp at a restaurant again. 

I went for sushi with of a couple of girlfriends last night. I'm not brave enough to eat raw fish, so I usually go for shrimp tempura. I order the appetizer, which came with 4 pieces of shrimp and mixed veggies. The food came fast and was hot. After biting into my second piece of shrimp, a long vein (poop) fell out of the shrimp remaining in my hand. I have never been so disgusted! I cut into the remaining two pieces, and poop was in abundance. At this point, I'm finding it difficult to not puke on the bar. I ate poop! We notified the waitress, and she revealed that the shrimp came already prepared. $10 for frozen shrimp tempura is pretty expensive. She took away my plate with three of my four pieces of shrimp, and offered free ice cream. We passed.. It was cold and rainy outside. My check came, and I was charged for the meal. I was kind of shocked! 

I called the next day to speak to a manager, and a lady named "G" reluctantly offered to give me my money back. She never apologized, but seemed upset that I less than thrilled about being served dirty shrimp. 

I would never dine here again.. Tragic experience!Fries and shakes are the only this I liked about this place. Both my husbands and my burgers were dry and seriously lacking flavor. Service was terrible as well.For reasons I don't fully understand I gave this place another shot...albeit my last try was in Phoenix.  Well, if nothing else they are consistently bad regardless of the local.

So what's my beef?

First, the table was filthy...not dirty...filthy.  At fist we thought it was just sticky, but as my wife wiped it down with a baby wipe, it turned black with god knows what.

Next, we ordered coffe.  Coffe and cream (milk actually) showed up and after we poured it into the coffe we found some sort of an orange substance in the cream pitcher.   The waitress speculated it might have been crayon.  Crayon...really??

We told the waitress we wanted to look at the menu for a few more minutes.   Fifteen minutes later and she never came back.  While we were waiting the wife took another baby wipe and wiped off the exterior of the coffe carafe.  Well that was something that hadnt been through a dishwasher in quite a while.

So what to say here.  Service bad.  Cleanliness, and this is in the parts of the restaurant you can see, worse, I can only imagine what's going on elsewhere  Food, couldn't tell you.  We never got that far but some how, and based on my experience at the Phoenix location, I'm well certain we didn't miss anything.is tasted really good... but my daughter & I had bad tummy aches afterward:(Terrible. My boyfriend originally bought a car wash and detail only for it to take FOUR hours and they didn't even get to the detailing part. Why would you sell a package thats going to take you hours to get to? So I brought the car back on a week day, and it took 2 hours for them to get to it and another hour and a half to finally finish it! 
They did a good job and were apologetic, but we won't be going back.Came here to watch football but was disappointed. The TV situation was unbearable, and impossible to see more than 2 games. Not what I thought when I heard about this place. Definitely going back to Thirsty Lion.Sooo Sad that this location has been closed. Now we have to drive to the one located in central phoenix.Do not go here!!! Save your money, this place is not worth it at all!!! 

Ok so, the only reason we ate here was because it is located in the lobby of our hotel (The Mirage). We didn't leave the room til late that day, so we decided to just eat at BLT because we were so hungry, the menu sounded decent, and the front desk lady had recommended it because they serve "spiked milkshakes". 

We were pretty excited to try out the food, so I ordered the chicken buffalo burger with fries and a malibu rum milkshake and my friend ordered a cheese burger with fries and a twinkie milkshake. First of all, just two plates of burgers, fries, and milkshakes cost us 65 dollars, which would have been ok if the food was any good!

My spiked milkshake had no rum and my friends twinkie milkshake tasted like frozen milk with a piece of twinkie sticking out of it. The burgers were not tasty at all, mine had some kind of nasty blue cheese spread (mind you I love blue cheese), the fries had an aftertaste, and the ranch dressing was watery. Just disgusting, never again!! We didn't even get half way through our meal.....I just can't with this place any more.  Red Robin used to be a fun family place, then they tried to make it upscale and got rid of the games, kids coloring pages, large balloons, fun posters etc....  I've never thought the food was that great, but the shakes are awesome and the kids used to like it. Going in there now is the utmost test in patience and tolerance.  The service is horrible (more because they seem understaffed than because the servers are inept), and there are fewer menu options and higher prices.  The number of kids in there and the noise level will drive you to drink; but not there, because the glasses are dirty and the manager will tell you that boogers on the glasses are just scratches.  Oh, and the bathroom is disgusting. If there is no soap and the trash is overflowing, then I'm not sure any of the employees are going in there let alone washing their hands.  In my opinion, Red Robin turned their backs on their customer base by trying to upgrade and make it more adult. I would never go there with all adults and it's not really fun for kids anymore.  Thanks but no thanks.Jet is a nightclub located in Mirage casino.  Although the music was very 80's not that it is a bad thing, I did not really enjoy myself at this club. I did not like the crowd either; one guy I met was also from NYC and he said to me "I feel sorry for you" I said with my heavy n.y. accent, "WHY DO U FEEL SORRY 4 ME?" Then he said "never mind I don't."  Weirdoo.pretentious, stuffy and more geared toward retail than the practice of yoga. Went once, will never go againarrived at 9:30pm when they clearly closed at 10pm according to the posted hours on the window. door was locked and the 2 employes inside just stared at us, couldn't even come to the door to apologize for closing early. won't be returning.My first thought: It's like a wannabe L.A ink but for nails and the service blew!

When I drove by the little plaza it's in and saw their sign, I thought it was an awesome/fun idea and that it'd be cool to get my toes done there, but I was deceived. I went in on a Saturday afternoon and their were two girls working on clients and one girl at the register and it was completely dead. The decor is hip with black couches, cool fashion/local mags, flat screens, and the wall paper is of the strip, so kudos on decor. 

No one acknowledged I was there I had to literally introduce myself to the girl at the counter. She said it'd be about 15 minutes so I ran next door to the Stussy store and ran back and they still weren't ready. I stuck it out for another 15 and finally the girl at the register said she'd start the pedi bath for me and I could sit there. I waited another 30 and then she tells me her employee is late/called off so now she has no one to take care of my pedi and she wasted an hour of my time. I tell her I want my toes to be one color (make it easy) so she gets the nail polish and starts to paint and she does a crap job at that. Then at one point she accidentally drops the nail polish and it splatters all over my purse. At this point I'm done. She didn't charge me and my toes looked like a five year old painted them and I just ended up taking it off when I got back to Cali.

This took place in May 08 so maybe they've gotten better since then but aside from the nail polish mishap the girls that were working there weren't your typical Asian nail ladies.  They were young and pretty with tattoos and hip hair cuts,  and they looked like the girls you'd find at a chic L.A hair salon, but really they have no hustle in them.  Going here made me appreciate the little mom and pop places with the Viet ladies that tried to up-sell me, tackle me with hellos and welcomes when I walked through the door, and really get down and dirty and get the job done right!

Recession=mad hustle=no "for lease" sign in the window.Today I ate here and the beans were way too salty to eat and the rice was almost the same, but a little more tolerable. Wanted to send it back, but my husband insisted that I let it go. 

Also, one of the worker's had a child running around the restaurant ( about 5 years old), and he was touching everything ( silverware, napkins, toothpicks) it was horrible!! The child was climbing on the front counter and running back and forth and sliding on the floor. 

I may give the place another try in the future because I have had good food here in the past. Sorry Filiberto's :(I think we are have given our local coffee house it's last shot.  Let me start with the breakfast sandwich that has the worst scrambled egg concoction on it its impossible to eat. That was the first visit. Coffee was nothing to write home about either. Went another time and got an overpriced pizza that looked great when it was coming to the table but after careful inspection it was the greasiest thing I had ever seen and too greasy to even pick up!! I wrote this review last year when they had the hot dog cart but apparently i didn't hit the post button. Still haven't been back.
  We said we would never repeat but got hooked in again by noticing a hot dog cart out front. Don't eat them often so it is a rare but treasured treat. Went inside and ordered the foot long 1/2 lb hot dog and a bratworst plus two iced teas. Came to over 17 dollars and they handed us two  buns in baskets and told us to take them outside to the grill. I asked if they had a bigger bun and they looked at me like I was stupid! huh? A 6 inch regular bun? Can you not afford foot long buns for your foot long hot dogs? I should have asked for a refund  but my guy said he wouldnt eat his if I told them I didn't want it. Instead I asked for a box and boxed the hot dog and threw the stale bun away. These people know nothing about food. We will never return because there are many better and friendlier places to enjoy without being raped  of your hard earned money for bad food!
P.S. you cannot get a refill for an iced tea if you have not ordered food along with it.If you are considering a stay at the W and you are over the age of 18, please reconsider. 

The property is hip and the design is very attractive - but the actual accommodations put form over function in many ways. That, and the service - with some exception - was much too "wtf bff l8r lol" for the $$$ that you pay. 

Upon arrival, we parked our car in the rotunda...great first impression until we were ignored by the valet service. Perhaps it's because we rolled up in Mazda 3 rather than the Jaguar or BMW that shared the space with us. Pardon our "hoopty"! Next time, you can save the "who the f are you" glances for your buddies. 

At the check in desk, we were greeted half-heartedly by a woman who was remotely helpful, if not being thorough enough in an explanation is acceptable as "helpful". We were handed our room keys, wristbands (which I'm still not sure what purpose they serve) and an impatient ::sigh:: and we were on our merry way. The Valet finally caught up with me. Thanks! I reciprocated the same "f you" look :). 

The room set up is interesting, however, the bed is so close to the door (which must be very thin) and every little noise in the hallway is clearly heard. Including drunk 20-somethings on their way back to slumber. While I find their planned bedroom activities interesting, I'm not sure I want to hear about it...while I'm sleeping...

The bathroom set up is innovative - and again, very attractive to the eye - but even a nearly opaque glass door to serve as privacy for the toilet is a bit revealing. Who wants to see someone squat down and take a pee? Aren't their websites to satiate that interest?

Starting about 10:30 PM, you can expect to hear a rave party in your room, no matter if you wanted it or not. I like Boom-Boom-Pow just like the next guy, but...I also wanted to sleep. Whatever gathering was being had in the lobby or whatever "hip" nightclub was shaking the entire property. 

The room service wasn't bad, but much overpriced for the entrees we received. At least the person that delivered the food treated my wife and I as if we were real humans...the only good interaction we had while at the W. 

Save all other inconveniences, the fire alarm at 11:50 PM was certainly the icing on the cake.  

I've stayed at many top-notch hotels and this certainly was the worst. What makes it harder to swallow is that my wife booked this as a surprise - she felt horrible, and that is the worst amenity the hotel had to offer. 

I guess I'm not hip and with it anymore? Figure it out, W Hotel.This review is for last night's Thanksgiving dinner.  It might not seem fair to write a review about one bad dinner after having had many other positive visits to the District.  However, while I have been amiss in positively yelping the District, I have verbally raved about this gem to my friends and coworkers.  That ends today.

Our family of three had the District's Thanksgiving fix prixe dinner with wine pairing for $50 per person.  Our expectations were realistic especially since we had had their Thanksgiving dinners at least three times before.  It is just a matter of soup to start, turkey with trimmings for the main course, and dessert to finish, with a wine option for each course.  

My complaints:  

1) Seating was horrible.  We had reservations and there were a lot of tables available.  Yet, they tried to seat us outside with the smokers and homeless people.  Then they seated us right by a door going outside resulting in our dinner being interrupted with cold gusts of wind sometimes accompanied by cigarette smoke.  (We did not protest right after we were seated as there was a row of glass doors and we did not know that the doors right beside us would be used as entrance ways.)  We were also seated right beside a busy beverage station.  

2)  The servers were awkward.  They seemed to know what to say but not how and how often. Each different server (and there were many) that came to our table greeted us with "Happy Thanksgiving."  They also seemed very eager to take plates away when we paused from eating.  Odd though that one server took our half eaten desserts but left a stack of dirty side plates on the table. 

3)  They couldn't even get the food right. The green beans were undercooked (super squeaky), and the bread was dry and served without butter. (But the turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy were delicious and plentiful.)   Dessert was gussied up in looks but was so unsatisfying on the tongue, like sweetened whipped canola with pumpkin flavor.  

4) The wine pairings were undrinkable.  My husband and daughter are not as picky about wine as I am and even they had to wince after each drink.  The port served at the end was drinkable, but far from good.  (We had plans to go directly to the movies right after dinner.  To get rid of the bad taste from the wine (which we barely drank), we went home to brush our teeth and tongues.  This is something we have never done.) 

At $150 +tip, last night's dinner at The District is the most expensive crappy dinner  I've ever had.  It failed on all counts (food, beverage, service, ambiance, value)  and I will never return.I know this could have all been avoided had I thought about "What if I get a flat?" before riding.  Anyway, I didn't think that and rode down to South Mountain anyway.

On the way back, I flatted and couldn't fix it.  I called a Taxi to drive me home... First strike was "where is Siesta and Central?"  Silly me for assuming that VIP Taxi might have Google or something along those lines where you can just type what I just said and it gives you an exact location.  

Second strike: "we'll have a Taxi out to you shortly"... Ok, can you be a bit more specific? Shortly is relative.  Shortly can be 5 minutes or it can be 3 days depending on the context.  I'll never know as the cab didn't show up for 1:25 minutes.  

Luckily someone else was able to pick me up.  I'll more than happy to spend the $40 I would have spend on the taxi on lunch as a "Thank You".Let me start off by saying...this was our second time going to this AppleBees...so in all fairness, this isnt a one time issue...as I start...

It had to be valentines night...we walk in and asked to be seated. The girl at the front says the wait is 5 minutes long. On a night like valentines, thats a really good wait time. So, me and my wife waited to be seated. It took around 10 mins to be seated. We sit down and order drinks, as most resturants do. Our waitress name is Jessica C by the way. We look over the menu and decide we want an appietiser and two meals. So, she comes back and we order all it at one time. No issue there and sounds as though it might be a really prompt meal.

A few minutes go by and we do get our appitiser first. I didnt realize that BBQ sauce came with it...no worries, we will just order/ask for ranch. To get Jessica's attention was near impossible. We finally do and i asked her for ranch sauce. No problem she said and we along her way. As we are enjoying what we can of our food, she comes back with other drinks for another guest, well i assumed that the ranch would be on this tray, but no. She gives other people their drinks and continues to take orders. By this time I getting a little heated, we are almost done with our appitiser and no ranch sauce. Again, to get her attention near impossible.. Just so happens when our main dish comes out we ask the cook for ranch and bingo in less than a minute we get it...he even asked if we wanted a little extra...

So, continue our meal...pretty pissed now. And no attention from Jessica C at all. After around 20 minutes or so I do get her attention and asked her for refills on our drinks. And yes i did mention that we got our ranch sauce already. No apology no nothing. This takes forever as well. I finally had to get the bussers attention and ask her for refills. Around 5 mins later Jessica C had our refills at our table...she blamed new customers on her delays. What she doesnt realize is that i watched her the entire time mess with that stupid computer. After a few more minutes we decided we wanted to go and asked for our check. Oh Boy that was at our table in less than a minute. I payed her for the meals and didnt leave a tip...heck no...a tip is a thank you for great service...didnt happen! Even when we left the girls at the front didnt even say thank you for coming and visiting...WE NEVER PLAN TO EVER VISIT AGAIN!!We used to go to this place every other Sunday. The food quality changes depending on how busy they are. The only reason I'm giving it a low rate is the service. We ordered a ground beef the last time we've been there. I ordered well done. The meat was too stiff to be eaten and when I tried to talk to the waiter he was rude about it. He also claimed it was my fault because I did not order it correctly. Anyways, after a long conversation he just took the check back without an apology. The owner is always frowning walking around with a bad attitude. To summarize, if you like to have a nice and calm quality food with your family and friends this place shouldn't be your first choice.Today we brought a friend from out of town to this place because we liked it so much last time we went there.  It turned out to be a complete disappointment.  We had to get the food to go because the friend had a plane to catch.  The guy told us it would take 10 to 15 mins for the food to be ready.  We waited.  While we were waiting, everyone else got served, even people that came to the place AFTER us.  After 20+ mins, there was no sign of the food, I asked the guy and told him that we were in a hurry.  He said "it should be ready in 4 mins." (his exact words).  10 mins passed... no food.  I don't even know how long we ended up waiting for 3 waffles.  Finally the food was here, they were questioning us what we ordered.  At that point I was just furious.  Right, took you forever to get our food because you served everyone else first and now you are telling me that you don't remember what we ordered?!
I will NEVER go back. NEVER. EVER.In a word - AWFUL!


 I'm a self-confessed bit of a food snob and on the surface this place looked like the perfect place for breakfast on a... Sunday.


 BUT....


 ... standing in the queue decided on the 5-portion hot breakfast. I was given 1 small scraggly piece of fatty bacon, 1 sausage [very poor quality sausage meat], 1 greasy potato cake, a spoonful of watery scrambled egg and a spoonful of mushrooms + a piece of granary toast [which was the best bit of the whole breakfast].


 What added insult to injury was when I got back to my table and started pondering the price (£5.25). Considering you could buy individual items at 65p each, if I'd just picked 5 it would have only cost me £3.25 (+ toast). I had been ripped off £2 because they called 5 items a particular name.


 Would not go back.CLOSED!!

They owed so many hard working people so much money. I'm thrilled that they got what was coming to them. 
Best wishes to the staff that they walked out on.My previous review was written 3 years ago.  I've been back MANY times since, but my friends and I tried to go there tonight (2/15/12) and it was closed and there was a red warning sign on the front door from the Henderson Constable's Office.  Everything inside looked the same, so I hope whatever legal issues will be resolved, but I'm not holding my breath.  It would suck because I have a $40 gift certificate which, if not redeemable at the Sushi Factory West location, might be worthless.

The quality of the food has never seemed to go down these past couple of years, but the place was NEVER really busy, even during peak times.  There's approximately 10 sushi places up and down Eastern between Anthem and the 215, so I'm guessing this place might have succumbed to the glut of competition in the area.  Let's hope not!I've been to Ocean Prime 3 or 4 times over the last year, each time for larger business dinners.  This time there were just three of us sitting and the bar.  We had good drinks, great laughs and a delicious buttery crab and spinach drink.  I highly recommend the cucumber gimlet if you're game.

We decided to stay and order from the bar.  While ordering I selected the bone-in filet and asked for the peppercorn sauce on the side.  I wasn't 100% sure if I'd like it So I wanted to be safe, not sorry.  It was a $48 entree.

When dinner was served my steak had the peppercorn sauce smothered all over it.  I sent it back.  

Not happy about the request, the bartender returned my steak to the kitchen for a redo.  I would have never thought they'd bring the sane exact steak back to me, sans sauce.

How do I know?  Size/shape/texture and my buddy ordered the same temperature as me, but mine was much more re-cooked.

Frustrated and hungry I ate the flavor-washed steak and kept my mouth shut. Last time I eat here.  The end.The only thing that is like a diner here is the decor... First of all, I couldn't help but notice the foul smell that filled the restaurant when we sat down. I don't know if it was a bathroom issue, or the food just smelt like poo...The service is so-so. The jukebox at the table we sat at didn't even work. The food was a little over priced, and not many vegetarian options. I usually enjoy a diner for it's music and interesting crowd. But this place was dead on a saturday, the service was mediocre. I had a simple grilled cheese. I didn't think anybody could really mess that up, but it was not even warm on the inside and the fries were stale.  My friends had breakfast for lunch, the food was so greasy and looked like it was from a cafeteria lunch room at summer camp...

I probably won't ever go back here again.I have been a loyal customer of Pizza Napoli for almost for 4 years.  Tonight I ordered a pizza with eggplant on it.  It came fried, and I don't eat fried food.  I called to complain, and they sad I got what I ordered.  I was unaware it would be fried, they said it was my responsibility to ask.  I said I was unhappy and would like it replaced, the manager simply said no.  I asked him if it was worth 1 small pizza to lose a long time customer, and he said he didn't care.  For there HORRID customer service, AVOID THIS PLACE.  There are plenty of other pizza places to choose, I know I will be ordering from somewhere else next time.499 for a room with a view...
put on hold for 30 minutes... no call back from manager... charging my card more than what was paid for... inexperienced clerk trying to figure out what I'm trying to figure out... I paid cash and they didn't mark it.... clerk is as confused as I am! 
I had scheduled an appt at the spa... cancel!
Jennifer the manager finally took the time to talk to me. Basically all I heard from her was... "Okay...??" I'll be booking elsewhere and let everyone know from Banner that this is a place they should avoid!

An hour on the phone trying to sort out the bill. 
Not worth it.

AGREE WITH MELISSA K: 20% gratuity was added onto the tip, I was quoted for a different price for massage and facial.

EDIT:
Honestly had I read this before my spa visit, I probably wouldn't have even bothered, I was going to say that the spa visit went well but yes I completely LIED about the phone call. 

"We have no record of additional phone conversations or billing issues with this guest and encourage the guest to contact us directly if we can be of further assistance" doesn't surprise me (apparently I'm lying about the hour phone call- ) but your spa almost surprised me with a okay visit other than being quoted for a lower price. 
 
shows how much you know about your guests "previous reservation for the night before"... What really goes on with YOUR knowledge of your company?Came here late on a Saturday night with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday. Was so packed that most of our party had to stand, could barely move, and couldn't hear each other. The waitress was not very friendly and the drinks were not that great. My friend paid for me so I am not sure what the drink prices were like. Hubby also said he saw a few people actually smoking inside. Isn't there an ordinance for that? Needless to say, not my kind of place so we had 1 drink, paid, and went next door to San Tan Brewery. If you like loud, overly crowded bars with bad service, then maybe this is your place.This gets the award for "most overrated place" in old town!  DO NOT eat here for breakfast! You will wait longer than they tell you, and then even longer for food and most of the time it comes out cold.  They always seem to be understaffed so service is not what it should be!  They definitely need to work their stuff out!What could make this Walmart even worse than it already is? No, it's not your fellow shoppers, rather its the lousy attitudes of the staff at this store. From the b*tch who scanned my box of kitty litter and then pointed at it and said "I'm done with that" because she was too lazy to pick it up and put it back in my cart; the associate who was standing in the middle of the aisle complaining about having to put items back on shelves; or the staff manning the service desk who were arguing with customers about returned items this store has really gone downhill. 

Sure, I can agree that Walmart employees may be underpaid, they don't get health insurance, and they are probably the butt of a lot of jokes, but hey, you have a job which is better than a lot of people these days and ultimately it's still a customer service job so perhaps you should be nice to the customers who are paying your salary.

I've shopped at other Walmarts where the employees are friendly and helpful but that's certainly not the case at this one.I did not enjoy this place. They crammed six of us into a small booth, the waiter was sweaty and had to hover over us to do everything and it wasn't even good fondue. They bring the cheese out in bowls and mix it in front of you...the cheese looked like it came out of a package like you'd buy at a grocery store - perfectly rectangular and clearly not freshly grated. I've made better fondue at home for a lot less money. And a lot less time. It turned into an almost 3-hour ordeal just to leave still hungry. 

If you have the time to drive and you really want a good fondue, go to the New Glarus Hotel.I have played both courses in years past and I must say, both have gone downhill.  Champions is filled with unprepared divots and unbelievable amount of ballparks on the greens.  It's like maintenance isn't doing anything all the sudden.  Maybe the PGA is in a poor financial position because they definately are not keeping it up.

    Stadium is the worst I've ever played it.  Most unprepared ball marks I've ever seen, course is ridiculously soft and the greens are not only hairy (rolling about 6) they also didn't even mow the first foot of the green all the way around.  All in all, for what they charge, they should be ashamed at the conditions.  They claim a PGA Tour Experience, but no PGA Tour player would put up with these embarrassing conditions.

      Last, I'll say that our caddies, while nice guys, were a BIG part of the problem.  I've played Bandon Dunes, Chambers Bay, Torrey Pines, Pebble and many other caddie clubs.  TPC Caddies are the worst trained I've ever seen.  They are a big part of the maintenance issue.  Finally, after watching both caddies not fix a ball mark or fill a divot in 5 holes...I told them I expected each of them to fix 3 ball marks per hole at minimum and to fill as many divots as they could.  Embarrassing for the course for me to have to tell them that.  Whoever is training the caddies should be fired!!

       I also played Grayhawk and Weekopah.  One thousand percent difference.  Both greens were good, courses well maintained and service was great.  

        Of all the golf I've played, I'd say if you pay less than $90 to play Stadium Course,  it's worth it.  Any more than that, go to Weekopah or Grayhawk.  For the Champions Course, don't pay more than $49.  You'll be disappointed.We stopped in here while waiting to get into the Bacchanal Buffet. The hostess took us to a table and said someone would be with us shortly. Weird ceiling and walls. After waiting for 45 minutes, no one had come to our table to take our order. We searched the menu and walls for any instructions that we weren't aware of, but there was nothing to indicate that we were to do anything but wait for someone to come to our table and take our order. We poured over the menu over and over, they seemed to have some exceptional and expensive dishes ($161.00 for some Kobe Beef), but no one came, so after 45 minute of waiingt, we left and went to an ice cream place.How have more people not reviewed this place? It's a 20 minute trek from the lobby to the motel six looking room. DO NOT GO HERE.All I have to say is "shit hole"  Just thinking about it makes me want to vomit.  And don't even get me started on the mirrors on the ceiling.Let me start off with this, the employees there are great. The food, the prices and the fact that they took out the fire pit on the patio makes this place absolutely passable ever damn time. The draw is to come watch sports. I have satellite for that, and I can actually stomach the food I cook at home or order out. I know what a novel concept. The burgers are ground up trash that taste like they came straight from a garbage disposal. There wings are whatever, nothing special there. The menu is a big sign of worrying more about quantity over quality. Word to the wise, don't sacrifice quality. This place is nothing special and seems to be content with that.Now closed.DO NOT EAT HERE!!! WORST SERVICE EVER!! From management all the way down to the host.....Just plain BAD SERVICE! Now let me tell you about the food. The nigiri is overstuffed with rice and can barely make out the taste of the fish. Read this article below, I have never gotten sick from Sushi until now.

"When sushi is handled properly in a reputable establishment by a master sushi chef, the risk of getting a food-borne illness from eating it is extremely rare. According to FDA statistics, you have a much greater chance of getting sick from eating poultry or beef than from eating raw fish. But if you eat a spoiled piece of sushi, you won't care about statistics.While you can't possibly know if the raw fish was kept adequately refrigerated or whether the server or preparer properly washed his hands before handling your food, you can use your powers of observation to discover clues that may help you prevent putting your gastrointestinal health at the mercy of a less-than-reputable sushi restaurant" -eHowBEWARE OF EXTRA FEES! DON'T INITIAL THE REGISTRATION CARD. IT'S WHERE THEY NICKLE AND DIME YOU FOR RESORT FEES THEY NEVER TOLD YOU BUT ASKED YOU TO INITIAL HERE.

Was just there last weekend to celebrate my birthday.

It was chaos.  No one seems to know what they were doing. The front desk were just standing there talking to each other. The guests looked so confused. Oh, did you know they charge you resort fees on top of room fee?!

I managed a front desk of a hotel and was AR for a big hotel chain.

Customer service was by far as bad as a one star hotel. Wait. One star hotels are not rude . The AR department at the ARIA needs a lot of customer service training. 

It's goregous walking in but it goes downhill. The room had a weird smell. Set up was weird. PBX was just in a hurry to transfer your call and you can't even finish your sentence. They need to do an internal audit at this place, guarantee they will fail. 

Customer service was just horrible. If I managed that hotel, I would fire the  manager and the AR.

 RESORT FEES ARE EXTRA PER NIGHT! They don't tell you until you get a credit card charge. They didn't even give us an invoice when we checked out.Stay Somewhere Else -service is horrid -Aria has no soul!!

I am an avid Vegas goer. 8-12 times/year sometimes more for the last 10+ years. I have stayed all over the Strip from dives like Imperial to luxury like the Wynn. By far Aria was the worst experience ever. I tried it twice just to make sure it wasn't just one bad experience, the second was worse than the first.

-Check in process was a disaster, long line and unfriendly staff. 
-Maid service was poor, several nights they didn't even service our room, we had to call for towels and wait 2+ hrs, we had to call for a blow dryer --what woman in Vegas doesn't need a blow dryer. 
-Service: HORRIBLE, from the front desk to the jerk off bartenders at the pool to the Clubs, one person was more stuck up and rude than the next
-Rooms: very small, need more mirrors, need bigger beds, the only positive thing I can think to say is the beds were very comfortable -perfect for one person, a couple? forget about it -your husband can sleep on the floor
-Restaurants: over priced and NOT good food or service, long waits and NOT worth the wait

GO STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE, ANYWHERE ELSE ---don't even bother coming here. 

It feels like a big tin can, aHaven't even gone yet and already disappointed.  Was planning on going with 2 other families.  Each family purchased a Groupon for this restaurant and they will only let us use one per table.  We are 3 separate families so we should each be able to use our Groupons!I had no idea it was going to be so hot that I would not be able to taste anything for days after.  I am all for hot food, but this was NUTS!!  Was the joke on me?  who knows, but I will probably NEVER eat at this place again based on how hot the food was.  

I had the Green Chili burrito and could taste nothing but unbelievable HEAT.Extremly Dissapointed, I came to this place thinking it was truly the best place in Vegas but its not even close to Good. Don't Waist your Money.Donuts are really good, if they have any when you get there!!!  Went in on a Tuesday morning at 1030, and they only had a total of 10 donuts. Drove out of my way to go there and still ended up at Dunkin Donuts. Very disappointed!!I always take a day before I write a negative review - I want it to be thought-out rather than reactionary. 

This place has poor service. Since I was having the car washed to thank someone for letting me borrow it, I paid for the most expensive basic wash (24.99) and asked that they at least make sure they vacuum the car thoroughly, including under the floor mats. When I picked up the car, the windows were smudged and there was dirt all over. I didn't want to spend any more time there, so I left. You're better off taking your vehicle to a self-wash place.

Not a horror story, but definitely not worth the money. Find somewhere else.My husband and I stayed at NYNY, which was our first time to stay there in Vegas.  We checked yelp and saw this place, so we decided to check out.  I don't eat beef, so I ordered vegitarian burger.  Oh boy, it was way salty and worst burger ever. My husband ordered Black and Blue burger.  He said meat was overdone and way too much salt.  Fries were too greesy and not even tasty.  We just had a couple of bites and left.  I wish I can give negative star.I wish I could write a thorough review of this place.  

We were told it was 35 minute wait - no biggie.  We waited for an outdoor table on a beautiful afternoon - 12:30 pm on Monday (4/09).  

We got seated About 45 minutes later at a great table facing the boulevard.  For such a long wait I wasn't sure why their were multiple empty tables outside.  This place could turn over much more money if they filled them.  Their profit isn't my problem though.  We soon figured out why the tables weren't full.  They were most likely severely short staffed.  Although, since there were three hostesses to seat, one wouldn't have assumed so.  

We sat and sat and sat. No acknowledgement.  No water.  No "I'll be right with you".  20 minutes and nothing.  Not a word.  Perhaps, they thought the view was enough.  One waitress passed us and we tried to get her attention, but she looked in the opposite direction as she passed.  So, 20 minutes going onto 25 minutes and this is added to the 45 min wait for a table.  We ended up walking out.  Why are we going to pay our hard earned dollars for food plus tip when there was a clear problem here.  
Who knows how long the food would have taken to arrive.  

We went elsewhere and then came back for that frozen hot chocolate to-go.  The short, it wasn't anything special.  It was good.  But we truly are the dummies for paying an absurd ($15) amount for a humdrum to-go milkshake.  
  
How upsetting that for as often as I go to Vegas I can neither recommend not go back.We had an enjoyable time on Easter Sunday at Springs Preserve.  We made breakfast at home early and were going to catch a quick bite from their menu to the right when you walk in to the restaurant.  They were not serving from that menu ONLY the brunch.  We had planned to eat here when planning what we were going to be doing on Easter Sunday.  I think this should have been posted on the website or they should have told the guests when they were buying their tickets for the Preserve.  I had a few snacks in my purse but my daughter was getting a bit cranky to say the least.DISCLAIMER: I did not eat here. I thought it was a problem that the only way I knew I was in a pizza joint is because there were pizza boxes on the wall. It didn't even smell like pizza. It was confusing.I'm sorry I missed these reviews before we visited Bacon. I obviously did not look very well, unfortunately for us. Our original plan was to go to the Breakfast Club down the street but they had an extremely long line that snaked outside. I wish I would have waited. I would have waited the same amount of time and got a better meal out of the whole experience. My husband and I were having a weekend away and Bacon was seriously the only flaw to the whole weekend.

We walked down to Bacon after we saw the line at Breakfast Club and proceeded to wait to even put our name on the list while a guy customer flirted with the hostess. Another hostess (maybe part owner) walked by us and didn't even say anything). We finally put our name down after they told us it would be a wait of 5-10 minutes. We ended up waiting another 15 minutes in line to sit down, all the while there were at LEAST 6 empty tables. They proceeded to seat a part of 10 that had reservation even though half the party wasn't there. I'm not in the restaurant business but even to me it was obvious how much space they were wasting where they could be seating customers and have more tables. 

We were finally seated in one of the booths that was empty when we first arrived. The owner/hostess seated us and told us she would let our waiter know that we were there and also let us know there was a party of 27 that was causing a bit of slow service. I think we knew then this wouldn't turn out good. The owner/hostess realized the waiter never got our drink orders and finally got us some juice. Our waiter finally arrived and seemed to be half there. My husband asked for French toast and he said they were out of it. Seriously? You're out of bread, milk and eggs and cinamon to make it? I think the owner/hostess could tell we were uhappy and tried to make some small talk. She asked us what we ordered and we told her. She told us it was her favorite! We waited, waited, and waited some more. I finished my juice which the waiter noticed and said he would get me some more. About 20 minutes later I finally received it. We watched as people who came after us received their meals and people who came before us still waiting. The table behind us no one even came to take their orders by the time we got our food! Word to the wise - if you DO decide to try it out try and get served by the bar area. They seemed to get their food right away.

We were seriously to the point of leaving when our food FINALLY arrived. I had to remind the waiter about the fruit, my eggs were runny, he potatoes were blah and my husbands pancakes were burnt. The bacon was blah. Definitely not something from I expected from a place called bacon. The only edible items were the toast and the fruit. 

The owner/hostess stopped by our table and asked how everything was. We pointed out the burnt pancakes and my eggs, and she proceeded to tell us she would get us some coupons as she walked away. We told her not to bother since we wouldn't be coming back. The waiter came over and said the meal was comped and the hostess/owner didn't even have the mind to come and deal with us anymore.

It's a shame. This place could be AWESOME if they had the right management, wait staff and cooks and decent bacon! It definitely needs a Kitchen Nightmares episode done on it. It's obvious to me that they're disorganized, ineffecient, and just don't know what to do! I wish we had just waited at the Breakfast Club.So the boys were out for an afternoon of bike riding and drinking, and my beau called me and wanted me to come join them at their last stop for a drink. When I ordered a drink, the waitress informs me that Chili's has a better beer (both on tap and in the bottle) selection than they do; I settled for a jameson on the rocks. It was getting later in the afternoon so I browsed their menu and found that Chili's has better pricing for the same pre-frozen-heated-in-a-fryer food. I order some tots and another jameson to tide me over. I was right, the tots were frozen but the Arcadia Tavern had put regular pepper on them to make them fancy.  As I was ending my second drink and eating some ice, I got a very nasty surprise. There was GLASS mixed in with my ice! It cut open my mouth on two different spots and I left the bar with a bleeding mouth.  All the manager offered us was free drink tickets. That was really lame. Bad customer service and poor beer selection and over priced food means we will not be going back.Avoid! I flew in for a conference and was severely underwhelmed by my experience here. 

Decor: meh, old, dated, not really kept up well

Room amenities: no coffee maker? Yes, they've got a tv and the room doesn't feature much else that feels modern

Staff: first impression was the blonde front desk girl telling me how she wanted to leave her job. Then she proceeded to charge me incorrectly. 

Food: good. 

Setup: running far behind and unaware of the small details. They grasped the large ones, just not the small ones. 

Overall, I didn't like it. I've stayed at other flagship properties of this hotel group and found myself wondering where the supposed luxury was. I didn't see it at any point during my stay. 

You can do better.I am huge fan of Michael Mina restaurants!  From San Francisco to Scottsdale I will go out of my way to experience his different concepts.  Always a great experience..except AF.

The food - fantastic!  Great presentation..flavorful and unique in combination of ingredients.   Why a one star rating?  Service..

Service kills any positive thoughts I had about AF.  With so many choices we have as diners, restaurants should put their best foot forward when it comes to service.  I do not accept restaurants providing excellent food and mediocre service.

We must have had the new server that they just hired away from Applebees.. and let me tell you after spending $300 for two of us I expect better.  He would hardly talk, and when he did, it was mumbled.  Hardly came around to see if we needed anything, was laughing and joking with his other table and barely said two words to us.  

Why the attitude I don't know.  It was that way from the start.  My recommendation is don't use your weakest talent to take care of your strongest customers.  Just doesn't work.   

Even after sending a quick note about out disappointment to their people.. No one seemed to care.  And at this point neither do I - off to new and different restaurants.For all appearances, it looks good.

We literally fasted from breakfast so we could have an early dinner at the Buffet - Husband and I both ended up with the worst (*crab smelling*) upset stomach ever.

The crab/shrimp were previously frozen, very watery, bland and - BAD. The only thing the husband and I both ate (and a small quantity) and both are 100% certain we got sick from. We eat a LOT of seafood and know some serious quality when we find it.

I'm not saying that the seafood at this buffet is always bad - but this was enough the first time so we wont be back and advise others to think twice before eating here.

Cant remember anything else about this buffet apart from the fact we got the sh*ts!The ambiance is nice, the food is good (and the crab legs were sweet and pre-cut to you could drop the juicy crab into your mouth without any work.) 

The 1 star is because of the management. The service gets 2 stars (why is it that when you have all you can drink champagne that you NEVER see the waiter!)

recap:
Management: 1 star
Service: 2 stars
Food: 4 stars
Deserts: 5 stars

We paid $23 for the Weekend Brunch (Sat & Sun 7am-4pm). It's a great food value and for another $7 you can get all-you-can-drink champagne or Bloody Mary's. 

Here's the problem with The Buffet at Aria--the management is terrible and the service is mediocre. When we paid (as we walked in) we were asked by the cashier if we wanted the champagne or Bloody Mary's and a few of us were trying to decide what mood we were in. 

The cashier said: "You can choose now, and change your mind later." I'm sure she was trying to keep the line going.
A problem occurred when a few of us "changed our minds" at the table and the waiter said "No." We had to stick with what we originally ordered.
What? 
We explained that the cashier told us we could change our minds and the waiter again insisted that that was "the rule" and there would be no exceptions. 
No exceptions. (This phrase was uttered to me six times in the next 20 minutes)
We protested until it became uncomfortable and then I asked for the manager.

Again, we just wanted to switch our drink order from Bloody Mary to champagne. 
The manager arrived and told us many people want to "switch" and it is not allowed. We explained that the cashier told us we could. And she insisted that we couldn't. 

We were a table of 8, and it became uncomfortable, and so many of our friends said: "that's ok...we'll just have the Bloody Mary. Or: you can have my champagne." At some level everyone just wanted to keep the peace. 

I informed the woman she was a very poor manager because while I understood the "no switch rule", she should stand by her employee's word. (The cashier said we could switch!)

Her retort was that the cashier's were part-time employees and they didn't know what they were taking about, and she wouldn't "honor" their word.

In the end, after an uncomfortable and lengthy confrontation, the manager let one person switch (and warned us that she couldn't switch back.) It was ridiculous and unacceptable behavior from a manager and I was shocked. Aria should be ashamed.Lots of hype, paid for the $12.00 wash and it came out dirty. This was not what I wanted or paid for. The entire front of the car is still filthy from sitting at the airport. I thought maybe by paying for the top of the line car wash, I'd actually get a clean car. Since I didn't leave the car until we got to the house, I didn't see the dirt. Buyer beware. Check the car before leaving the property.This one used to be a regular for us.  They have progressively removed gluton free options to the point that the remaining food options are undesirable.  They also changed proprietors and the customer service is not what it used to be.  We will no longer eat here.Awful!  I was there 4 or 5 years ago and thought it was good, but today was awful.  My dining partner couldn't even eat her taco salad.  When we asked for a PARTIAL refund we were told no since she ate some of it...How do you know if you don't like it if you don't eat it?  Salad was wilted and the beef was way too salty.  After we complained service pretty much stopped after we complained.  We had to ask for more water but you could tell they were a little put out by our request.  I am very disappointed for I liked this place and it has some charm.  Not sure what is going on but it sure has changed.  Also noticed not as many customers as before.The most disgusting shepherds pie on the planet! Service sucked, prices were ridiculous drinks were watered-down. Who's  running this place? Will never be returning!No more Coolatta. The Coolatta machine is broken. At all locations, apparently. Why the (*bleep*) are you still selling Coolatta if the machine's broken? Does corporate office know they're scamming customers? Horrible customer service.It is no longer the Lift, Wildfire Casino took them over.
I stopped by at 11:34 on Feb 1 Saturday night. The sign outside says ring ell after midnight, well parking lot was empty but I was just stopping in to get a bite to eat. I rang the bell, waited outside for a minute, looked inside and seen a girl behind the bar not paying attention sitting by herself. Rang it again and she was walking around. So I left, as I am driving out she opens the door but I was already aggravated so I kept going. 
When it was the Lift on a Saturday night they would have about 80% of the bar filled, now empty. Another good Vegas dive closed down by big corporations.one of the worst ive seen next to frank and lupe's .  the grisly adams dip sh@* bartender was using the toilet plunger, from the bathroom, with sh@*  on it to unclog the sink  which held ice he was serving in  drinks.   the place smelled like feces and look like it had never been cleaned. shame on everyone at dave's electric fecal matters..I walked in the lady was ok. I asked for a calorie count she said they don't have one. I didn't end up eating there. As I walked to the side I realized a mop near the grill. Gross they have an A. The health inspector must have shown up on a good day.I have worked with countless handy people and the handyman that the company sent was not handy.  He was slow, cranky, did not exude confidence and took more than twice as long as estimated (I knew the estimate was too short, but he is the expert right? wrong!), and cost 40% more.  In addition he broke a very expensive personal item with little remorse.  I could not wait until he finally left.  Cross LV Handyman off of your list of go to handy people.I saw this show when it was still in the old showroom.  I can only give it one star because "Eek! Methinks not."  I went hoping to see one guy who ended up not being in the show the night I went.  None of the guys who performed that night did it for me personally.  The one who did wasn't even one of the performers.  He was one of the hosts/servers who was good-looking and friendly, but upon close glance, he had really bad complexion.  Talk about disappointing!    

It was bad enough having to go to Hooters Hotel to see the show, but the some of the numbers just really took the cake. Who comes out in a monster mask with a long snout trying to turn women on?  Scaaarryy!!  Maybe some women can laugh it off or find the guys hot enough not to care.  I however thought some of the numbers were just weird!

The guys do a good job of coming out to the audience and giving the ladies attention, but they will only stay and do a little something extra for you if you tip them.  No thanks, especially if you're going to come out in a monster mask!  No they don't really come to you with a mask on :p  But still, I prefer the no-tipping policy of shows like Thunder From Down Under and American Storm, where the only "tipping" involved is at the end when you pay for a photo with the guys.  At Men of X you tip AND you have to pay for your photo at the end!  At least I think you do, I chose not to take one.

I see that this show has gotten many good reviews.  If you come with a live group or find yourself attracted to these guys I can see how ladies would enjoy themselves at this show.  Personally I do not need to see the show again nor step foot inside Hooters Hotel, especially when you can get a better production value (i.e. no weird/scary routines) with other similar shows at less seedy/run-down hotels!went here for lunch because we're looking for some asian food on the strip, checked yelp, saw this place has 3  star and pretty decent price. BEWARE that's not true. If you're from cali or seattle don't bother coming here.  There were so many wrongs with this place:

food sucks, msg in kalbitang. we had bibimbap, fried rice, kalbi tang, tofu soup and spicy beef soup. not a single one of them impressed us.

price is somewhat expensive. 12.95 for mediocre tofu soup, and 15.95 for bibimbap. 

fried rice has no taste. i don't know if they forgot to add seasoning at all.

the food pic in the menu is totally different. bibimbap pic looks like it has plenty of veggies, the real thing is half the size and not filled with veggie. the fried rice pic is also different, it's like ordering sunny side up and you got scambled egg

banchan is only 4 kinds: cabbage kimchi, anchovy, beansprout and chinese brocolli. the kimchi taste like kimchi that you buy from ranch99 in bulk

when asked for the bill, we had to wait 30 mins

ordered hot tea that costs money and the hot water is not refilled everytime. we had to ask the server for hot water, and she's so stingy with hot water. 

now i learned not to get asian food on the strip. best bet is go for the buffet.These guys at fresh wasabi microwaved my hamaichi Kama - scary!!!! Go to Sushi Brokers in Scottsdale for consistent and fresh sushi. Sorry this place does not cut it for me. Sushi rice was vinegary!Truly awful.  Our waitress was friendly- the rest- yuck.  Frozen (like what you buy at the store I am sure) Sweet potato fries and veggie burger.  The Philly roll made one person at our table ill.  The "Chef" and I do say that lightly, came out and ACTUALLY SAID TO US......  Are you sure it's not you?  Because I make the food fresh each day.  Yikes- horrible customer service- Never go back.....One star because you cant give zero! There were so many clues, but I ignored all of them. I'm not super picky when it comes to Chinese buffets, especially super cheap buffets. I'm a big kid. I know what I'm getting into. Or at least I thought so. I had a bad feeling when I walked in. I even asked to take a look before I decided to try it. It all looked good for the most part., but it's like that bunny from Monty Python and the Holy Grail; it looked good and harmless, but inside lurked an awful, ugly, vile monster.

I couldn't even finish my first plate. It was all so very very bad. Go there at you own risk!Wow. After seeing all the great reviews on Yelp we decided to try out Viet Kitchen, since it's right next to the Costco we go to all the time. We've had our share of Vietnamese food, so there were high hopes going in. Obviously, it didn't turn out so great. It all started when the lady took two separate parties' orders first even though they came after us...

We ordered fresh spring rolls, which usually comes with an awesome peanut sauce to dip in. However, when the rolls came, the wrapper was so thin it ripped, it was mostly lettuce and hardly any pork/shrimp inside, and the worst part was the peanut sauce tasted like nothing. Not a hint of peanut. Had to add some hoisin sauce to give it taste. 

I ordered the spicy beef noodle soup (similar to bun bo hue), and the lady asked to make sure I wanted it hot and spicy. I answered with an enthusiastic yes, and the g/f ordered the pork combo sandwich. The food took a while, and the sandwich actually came much after the noodle soup. How long does it take to make a sandwich? What's even worse, there was hardly anything stuffed between each bun (see picture posted). I wish I took a picture of my "spicy" soup...normally with a spicy soup the soup is red, but mine was clear with a dab of redness here and there. I had to supplement it with a LOT of sriracha sauce...definitely not impressed. 

On top of it all, the servers (different from the one that took the order) who brought the food were not friendly at all. They didn't say a word when putting our food on the table, and when we thanked them they didn't reply. This is definitely not a place we will be going back to; if there's ever a pho or noodle soup craving I'd rather drive down to Central Phoenix to Maxim Restaurant.staff sucks, you have something broken you report it to the staff they say ok go back to your apartment and we will be sending maintenance to help you out, no one shows up. Three days later we are struggling to open the door maintenance is walking by and sees us struggling comes by opens the door and notices the damages and tells us he is going to have to report this to security so that we can be fined!! hello we told you guys about our problem a couple days ago and no one showed up! We argue back and forth and he decides to give us a "pass" pshhhh..... in his own words he even said oh yeah staff sucks here I never got a work order for your apartment. like he believed us in the first place. oh but next time we will definitely be fined... Were out 
Stay away....Harbor Island sucks.DO NOT GO!!! I love CSI but this little tour is just...to put it bluntly...stupid. There are other places that will garner more delight such as losing money to the slot machine than to this god awful tour. You are not solving a crime...they practically provide you the answer when you are done with the tour. It is so lame...go take your money and ride a cab around the strip one time but don't get suckered into this....thing.

good for kids? yes...even a 2 year old can solve these crimes. If you are over the age of 8 you will be bored to death!If you are craving pizza that tastes like it as actually from New York forget this place. Not even close. It should be considered false advertising to include "New York" in your name. It implies the food is similar to food you would find there. This place would not last a week if it was in New York. That should tell you something!Good food, usually competent staff, horrible management that ruined the evening.

Been here plenty of times, food was always great.  Tonight, the medium rare steak came to the table bloody and cold.  Our awesome waitress Codi quickly took it back for more grill time.  Unfortunately, it came back still cold and this time chewy; a whole new steak was put on the grill for us.

That's when we got to meet the assistant manager.  He was cocky, condescending and unhelpful.  He asked our interpretation of medium rare, explained that we were wrong and that the new steak would be medium - in case the previous one was just a bad cut.  Our waitress had already told us a new steak would be brought out soon, so the only thing we wanted from Dan was a sincere word or anything to make the experience better.  Instead we got belittled by his thorough explanations.  And paid full price. 

We ended up sharing one entree while we waited and skipped the second drink / dessert.

TLDR For a $100 receipt, the management here will drive me to other choices in town in the future.  Too bad, usually a great restaurant.I would honestly give this property zero stars if I could. I held a meeting here in October and had my projector and many other items stolen out of my meeting space. The door was locked when I left and I had to be let in the room the next day. I lost over $1300 of merchandise and Marriott only wants to reimburse me $600. I was a Marriott platinum member but will now switch to Hilton. I REFUSE to give money to a company that steals from you and then refuses to take responsibility. The "new management" is just as horrible as the last one. I would stay ANYWHERE but this hotel....I will NEVER allow Cobblestone to touch any car I own. They damaged my car, denied it and then did the exact same action right in front of the GM (the dryer girl stepped into my rear hatch area to dry my large hatchback) and he said" oh, well ...your car is older anyway" and denied my claim saying the rear hatch would cover would break anyway even if the staff drying the interior glass were not standing WITHIN the hatch area-STAY VERY FAR AWAY!

ZERO STARS!Well....I had been hearing about this joint for weeks.  So after spending New Years Eve on Mill Ave, the hubby and I were looking for more than the undesirable street fair food.  We walked on over to Five Guys.  The line was long; the place was packed! "MUST BE GOOD", we said to one anther.  $4 something for the Small Cheeseburger.  We each ordered a burger and shared an order of "their award winning fries" (sarcasm).  Thirteen dollars later and fifteen minutes, we received our food.  We rushed two blocks over to our hotel.  Now to make a long story short, save your calories, time, and money.  I have had a better burger from the Golden Arches, for a lot less money. Twelve dollars less.  Happy 2011!WON'T EVER GO HERE AGAIN. Twice my wife and I went to eat here and we were seated and forgotten about. First time was seriously irritating, second time we got up and left after 8 minutes. Went across the street and ate BJ's then brought my receipt back and showed the manager were I spent my money that night. He was very apologetic and brought me I'm and gave us a gift certificate for a free meal for 2. We loved their pizza so after a few weeks we decided to try it again. Once again terrible slow service. We won't be going back.I really really really wanted to like this place. Santa Fe Station is the closest casino to my house so I was elated when I heard a sushi restaurant was coming in (even though i loved the pan roasts from Tides- the restaurant it replaced.) The hubby and I have tried this place twice hoping that the 2nd time might change our minds but nonetheless it sucked big time.

Our first visit was on a fairly busy Friday night yet we were seated at a table shortly after giving our name. We had a server that was really sweet, yet very busy. We ordered a couple of standard rolls and 1 specialty roll. I will admit the presentation was beautiful, but the taste was mediocre at best. The volcano roll had some extra ingredients that weren't listed on the menu and my hubby refused to eat more than the first bite of it. Unlike the previous restaurant that was located here, there is not a full bar, only sake choices- which also disappointed us. The worst part is that after our 3 rolls and 2 glasses of tea/soda our $60 bill was given to us, but never picked up. We literally sat there for 20 minutes trying to get the servers attention until we finally got up and walked over to the hostess station to pay our bill. 

Our 2nd visit was much worse. This time we got there pretty early on a Saturday night. They had many tables open (which should have been a warning) and we were seated almost immediately. We ordered 3 specialty rolls an iced tea and a soda. We got our first roll after about 30 minutes. Our limited-English speaking server came by to obnoxiously apologize 15 times in between getting our 3 rolls delivered over the course of 2 hours. The place was not even busy and it took them 2 effin hours to make 3 rolls????? We weren't full after the 3 rolls, but didn't have all night to stay for more. Of course I wasted no time getting our check this time because I knew the routine and walked right up to the hostess station to demand it. 

I predict this place will close very soon. There is no way a place can survive with that kind of service. The price is totally not worth it. Sushi Loca is right down the street with way better service, sushi and prices!What a tremendously disappointing experience, went in with the intentions of buying a pot and or saucepan I went in to the section and it was a tremendously confusing process everything is sold in some sort of set, no price tags, etc. No separate pans sold; I walked around the store for 15 minutes and didn't come across any customer service rep to answer my questions. I finally walked up to the register where one register was open.  The one guy working the one register with 6 customers on line was working at a snails pace.  Finally get the register after another wasted 15 minutes and the price of a 12 inch sauce pan was $150 because bobby flay slapped his name on.  I didn't make the purchase and I was furious.  Te last few times I came in here I realized they haven't made the customer experience seamless. I guests I'll be getting all this stuff on amazon now.  Kohls lost a customer.  They will be Caldors in 10 years.  Big box retailer out d business.  Too cheap.I was introduced to 808 Sushi by using a Groupon and i have to say they should probably not participate in that program any longer. They treated us like we were 3rd class citizens, service was bad, I had to ask for my food twice and it took over an hour. They wouldn't allow me to enjoy happy hour drink specials because i was using a Groupon. I explained i didn't want to use the Groupon for drinks and that i would pay separately!  I asked if you had to order food to receive happy hour pricing on drinks, she said no and still refused. Food was average. I will never go back.Pretty standard American-Chinese food. Nothing special. Went here to pick up dinner for the fam. The young girl behind the counter was nice, but there were 3 older women in the kitchen (which is completely visible from the register) who were yelling at one another in the back and fighting which was completely awkward/uncomfortable to sit thru when I was waiting for my order.I am the  head of a local knitting circle that  moved into Off the Beaten Path's new location after our previous meeting location closed. We were really excited to form a solid rapport with the shop has we had done with the owners of our two previous locations, one of them our "home" for many years.

We discovered right away the shop was ill-suited in both space and supplies to handle knitting in the shop, let alone a large group, but we wanted to support the shop so we made do.  As much as we wanted to establish a warm relationship with staff, we often found them unwilling to converse with us although they were at a register station just feet away, and often encountered strange behavior - such as frigid stares when a group member was teaching another to use a drop-spindle, and refusal for help in locating or ordering knitting notions.

However, the major trouble came when the owner somehow learned (she was never present during our meetings) that our group was sometimes discussing the non-mainstream lives and beliefs of some of our members. She found this unsuitable for her shop.  Rather than address this to me or to the group directly, veiled complaints were made to individual members when they were in the shop at other times.  Our group discussed how to address the concerns, but before we could take action, the owner made a phone call to me at work, during which she was extremely hostile and unprofessional. She then posted erroneous, defamatory information about our group and members on the shop's website.  I was shocked and disappointed that a business owner could not handle a simple matter with a group in a professional and respectful manner.

While the store does have a (granted, small) selection of yarns not available at some of the other local yarn shops, the strange layout, unfriendly staff, and the extremely unprofessional behavior of the owner toward frequent patrons is enough for me to recommend that knitters and other yarnies find other outlets for their business.Order the Fried Chicken Benedict and Warm Spinach.

The Warm Spinach would have been better if they didn't drench the salad in vinaigrette.  A completely weak $9 salad.  Small with no substance, much like the garbage of a hotel casino this place is located in.  Does anyone else besides me think it's time for place to go?  Imperial Palace?  Come on now, is this place even politically correct?

The Benedict tasted absolutely disgusting.  I enjoy artery clogging goodness as much anyone else but this was just so poorly executed.  So the place had a few biscuits, scrambled eggs, and two fried chicken breast fillet haphazardly lumped together on a plate, drench and I mean completely a quart of sauce drench in some sauce I cannot make out.  Nothing is spared, everything just tasted like this disgusting thousand islands mayo based concoction.  Even if the Fried Chicken was good, there would have no way for me to have known.

I asked if they could change the television channel over to the Oregon Stanford game, I got a yes, but no action.  Of course it's probably random chance with my server and runners but I HATE lip service!  If you're not going to do something of if you don't want to please don't tell me that you will, if not for the absolutely quick response time of Las Vegas Metro I would have stabbed the man in the back with the butter knife.  If you even think that the food is going to take another 15 minutes, why would you tell me it'll be a couple minutes?  Ridiculous!  Must have been at least 45 mins from when we put the order in to when the food came out.  I honestly looking back should have just took my friend's suggestion of walking out and leaving.  I just couldn't tell if he was serious, but knowing him as long as I do, I should have know he was.

I felt so bad for suggesting this place to my good buddy that I gave him my credit card for the night.  I know a lot of people like to come here for the first time because of their huge portion size (which at around $15 -$23 a plate I hardly think is that amazing) but I doubt there are many repeat customers.Are 0 star reviews allowed? We had take out and it was a freaking rip off. For two chicken teriyaki's and a small cup of miso soup it was $24? WTF?! It tasted like a  frozen dinner. Stay away and warn your friends.This used to be my favorite spot in old town...and then suede closed...and now it can only be described in ONE word: GHETTO!This is BY FAR the worst Subway I have EVER been to! The service was horrid, we waited almost 10 minutes to be waited on and there was no one else in front of us. They got our order wrong, the employee was incredibly rude and for the price we paid it was not worth it. When we complained to upper Management we did not get a response for over 5 days and they did not even try to offer any type of solution. Needless to say, even though this Subway is the closest to my house I will NEVER go there again and will never recommend it either!Racist.. the manager Joyce is seriously  racist. I heard she only employs whites. Her attitude is disgusting. Someone seriously needs to report her....just ughhh.. I will never ever go to this location ever again, no one deserves to be treated that badly.Terrible car wash. They are so busy that they let the vehicles air dry instead of wiping them down but when they do wipe them it's with a wet towel.   Worst car wash ever. Streaks where they did wipe down. Windshield dirty inside and out. Road and bug residue all over the front after the wash. Outside rubber and plastic treatment applied with many missing spots.   They may do good elsewhere but don't recommend this place at all.I went there for a full service car wash. The job they did was really bad. Not going there ever again.I ordered flowers for my friends graduation.  I called to place the order over the phone and had a budget of $75.  The picture I received of the flowers the next day was extremely disappointing.  The arrangement was poorly done and could have easily been placed for half the price using 1-800 Flowers or some other equivalent.  I would not recommend placing an order from here.I met a girlfriend for an impromptu pedi. I Yelped his place before making the appointments. It was okay, nothing special, my pedi is chipping one week later, and the same goes for my gel manicure. I have my cosmetology license and almost always do my own nails, let this be a reminder of why I do my own. I would definitely not recommend this salon.Yep. That thing Erin said.  Don't trust these people. 
I was sold French doors two years ago with screened side doors.  Even when I bought them I had expressed concerns about having dogs who could damage the screens and was reassured that with a lifetime warranty that there would be no problem replacing them under warranty. After months of back-and-forth calling, even having a representative come out and evaluate and reassure me that the parts would be ordered and installed, I'm now back to square one being told that I would be charged for a visit to evaluate and charged for any work and materials to be done. Finally I'm being referred to the original manufacturer so I guess I'm a lot luckier than Erin and that my manufacturer is still in business!Do not go here.  They run a scam where they charge members an upgrade fee and they not only do not upgrade the poor ass gym, but they turn around and sell it to a new buyer who they tell they can "charge an annual upgrade fee" and make some quick dough.I believe this is the same Arizona Elite Property in Gilbert,  AZ. This company is the shadiest,  most irresponsible company I've ever dealt with. They made agreements with my tenant without checking with me or even imforming me, and although my tenant paid on time, they withheld my money for almost two months. They deducted so many fees that I barely made any money on my first month's rent. Literally dozens of calls and emails got me nothing,  until finally, the person managing my acct,  who clearly knew nothing about rental property mgmt, told me if I didn't like how they were doing we could end the contract early. Thank God! Having this company manage my house was a thousand times worse than doing it myself. The owner/CEO, I don't know what he is,  Robert Kline never returned a single email or answered a single question or request despite the office people's assurance he would respond and make things right. Use a neighborhood teen to manage your property before you is this company!Don't go to this location.  The selection isn't as good as the larger stores and the customer service is horrible.  I am a big fan of Office Max and my wife buy's all the supplies for her business from them.  However, every time we go to the store at Tempe Marketplace we are met with sales associates who go out of their way to NOT be helpful.

Go to the 917 E Broadway Road or 1110 W Elliot Road store instead.  The sales associates there will go out of their way to help you.DO NOT use the ATT dealer at bell and the 101 near skeptical chemist . I took my phone in there because it got wet and got a new one. They didn't have many models in stock but sold me an S4 that was not waterproof after me asking for one and then denied I asked. These guys are scum.I have always used fletchers same with my family members but after this visit I will never return. Bought a groupon and after I got there I was told I needed $384 more of stuff done. I told them to hold off on work as when needing anything major or costly I like to get a second opinion. Well I went to get a second opinion and was told that fletchers is smoking crack that what I was told needed to be done was not the case at all. I honestly feel they are using groupon to get you in the door so you think your getting a smoking deal but then tell you that you need this and that to make the money they are losing thru groupon. I am very disappointed.Food is great - well other than their wings which pretty much are fried chicken drowning in sauce.

We ordered two weeks ago using their online ordering system.  Order came all screwed up - e-mail receipt did not match the printed one at all.  Complained and GrubHub (the delivery service) gave us a $20 credit.  The food was good and I've eaten in other stores before so we tried again tonight... and where do I start?

Here I guess!  Ordered online.  Got e-mail receipt including delivery time and our creidt.  I paid via credit card for the rest and included the tip.  Half hour after the estimated time (they're 1.2 miles from us) later the driver showed up.  He was very nice and very professional so he was the only positive about this experience.  He asked for the entire amount, sans credit, in cash.  We were puzzled but he showed no credit.  He got his phone out and called the store manager and let my husband talk to him.

At that point we got told that $20 credit was a store credit only - which baffles me as I had to click to apply the dang thing on GrubHub - and we could only use ordering directly.  He did at least finally let us pay via credit card, and I still feel bad we had no cash to tip the driver as we'd put the tip on the original credit card payment that never showed up.

So... if you want to eat in, I guess they're great and at least our order was mostly correct this time -although I am still utterly baffled why when I specicially ask any pizza place in this state for red peppers and cheese why they can't deliver those - but we will never use/order from Rosati's and/or their GrubHub counterpart again.Went to the parts department to get a seal for my Dodge 4x4. It was Saturday around 1:00 on 02/08/14. There was only one middle aged guy behind the counter. He brings out the part and says that will be 32.80 plus tax. I gave him the money and asked, isn't it 17 something on your web site? He said, well everything is cheaper online and gave me my receipt and walked off. What an ass. Returned the part and will never do that again. 

Also, it is a little obvious that the positive reviews are from the sales peoples' friends. When they use their first and last name and write it like a mini commercial.Terrible service. Please do all of the people who are stuck with this crappy company a favor and don't even consider them. They are very undependable and unpleasant to talk to. I got switched over from security networks and no one even said anything to me or sent us any info. I had activated a new card so my auto-pay would not work and I was sent a bill from Security Networks and sent back a check and updated payment info as soon as I received it. The excuse they gave me for not receiving this check for 4 weeks was because my account was switched over to Monitronics last Friday. So, why has Monotronics been calling my husband every other day for the past 2 weeks and telling him we have a balance due? This company is extremely unreliable and will make up any excuse and even argue with you to keep your money. If I want out I have to pay $1800 so I'm stuck for 36 months over-paying for a simple service. I wish I would have done more research as a first-time homeowner but hopefully someone will read this and learn from my mistakes.

This company does not deserve a good reputation so let's save others from getting caught up in this trap.Would you like some over-priced, mediocre pizza from an establishment that doesn't respect your right to self-defense? I won't be back unless they lower their prices and take down that stupid No Guns sign.buyer beware: had problems with this company, looked up roc # to find out it is suspended, used to be freedom airI have never been so disgusted by people that were supposed to be doing my pet and me such a good service. 
When I was at the vet's office in Scottsdale one week ago, I was talked into signing up for the Wellness plan. I had to tell about three different people that I would agree to it when all of them asked in between the vet coming in. I was told that the visit for the day and the vaccination my dog needed were all going to be covered under the first payment, so I agreed to it all. One lady came in and had me sign the billing statement, but had charged me for the vaccination and visit. After I commented, again, that I was signing up for the plan, she removed the charge for the vaccination. I didn't say anything about the charge for the visit because I figured that maybe I was wrong and it was not included. After everyone coming in and out a couple more times, the vet finally came back with my dog and said that we were all set. 
Between all of the people that I had talked to and having a puppy jumping around, it didn't even occur to me that they had not received my payment information... So I walked out, waving goodbye to the receptionist. I later received a phone message letting me know that they had not received my payment information and asking me to pay in the store because apparently there was something that I had to sign. Unfortunately, I didn't get the phone message until a few days later (my phone doesn't notify me of voicemail when it is off), but I went into the store on my very next day off, one week later. By then it had already been sent to their collections department - I guess that was okay because they were very friendly and removed my hold when I payed the bill. 
The problem was, however, that because it was sent to collections, I was charged for the vaccination AND the visit: charges that I only agreed to because I was under the impression that I was getting a whole medical plan for my pet with the fees that I was paying. Sure, I accept responsibility that I didn't realize I had not paid. That was an error on my part and maybe a dumb moment, assuming for some reason that they had my payment information on file or whatever. But I am a very honest person and I went to pay the money that I owed as soon as I could. But still, I had to pay over twice as much as I wanted to agree to? This is ridiculous. I would have signed my dog up for the wellness plan for her life - I LOVED the idea of stopping by and PetSmart whenever it was convenient for me and it would all be taken care of on the plan. 
I hope it was worth the assumption that I was stealing.I'm looking at the other reviews for Cafe Rhumba and I can't believe we all ate at the same restaurant. We found it to be very bland and boring. There is no way this restaurant compares to Chipotle in any way. There were 4 of us and we all had something different as none of us had ever been there before. All 4 meals were tasteless. The salsa had no taste, the chicken was not seasoned, etc. We will NEVER go back again. I could eat at Chipotle weekly and was happy to have another similar restaurant. What a shock to find it to be so bad.The pharmacy is just terrible. You are ignored and abused. I just spoke to the manager.  She asked to phone if I had a good experience as she was going to speak to her manager. I told her that in three years I have not had a good experience. They Are harried, abrupt and semi rude. No eye contact no thank  you for coming. You are abused and demeaned ineveryway. Terrible , terrible terrible!  Walgreens is much better. They may be over worked but they are polite. 

If you want to give them you business go ahead, they have not earned it   
I will never go to that pharmacy again. 
Susan WengerTerrible terrible terrible customer service. Went here multiple times because of the food. Never will order again. I've talked to them to order food and she confirmed the order and then I went there she didn't even have my order at all... Like Wtf. She told me 20 minutes. Went there in 25 minutes did not have anything and gave me an attitude. 

Second time, called to order pick up and they said they were closed but it wasn't even their closing time. Asked for their last call and they said 8:45 and i called at 8:40. Lazy people. I've worked in a kitchen and would never close early.The first 3 nights/days were great. Great room, nice casino. We were there in Mid Nov. Despite their website stating that they had one pool open in Nov., we discovered that all the pools were closed. But the big issue was their spa. IF YOU GO TO THEIR SPA, DO NOT TAKE ANY CASH, JEWELRY, OR VALUABLES! While I was getting a massage, someone got into my locked locker (pass code locker) and stole my Rolex watch and $1800 in cash! Yes, lesson learned, HOWEVER, guess what the hotel did for me?? NOTHING!!! Barely an apology. A security manager took he report. They then turned it over to their insurance company. I had to chase the insurance company down, and when I finally got them, of course they said the Hotel had no liability! So, I intend to spread the word through every message board and review site I can find. DO NOT USE THE SPA T THE COSMOPOLITAN, THEY HAVE A THEIF WORKING IN THE SPA WHO KOWS HOW TO GET INTO PASSCODE PROTECTED LOCKERS!F#%$ this noise. 

I take clean over fancy anytime. 


The beds were NASTY-no mattress cover- did not use fitted sheets. Had a naked down comforter (no duvet) with stains. 

This one was the icing-After a hot clean shower I go to put on the robe they provide. As I start getting ready I notice something in my pocket--------I find disgusting DIRTY g-string panty in my robe pocket. 

I don't think I'll be staying here. 

The hotel is  beautiful, hip, trendy, and yes a great day club and night club but when I'm paying $$$$  to stay here-please keep up the quality. Starting with the rooms first and then move on to the disgusting carpeting around the halls.Had no problems with this place until I went to pay with cash and was told they wouldnt make change! wait hold up, your a business accepting cash but you cant break a fiver? 

scam. After I told them to take the 150 cash and put 84 cents on credit ( yes I know but this is how ridiculous the situation was) Suddenly the counter host remembered he could help me out by breaking down my five bucks..unhuh. They still ended up getting .16 cents extra..wankers.

Next time I will book a car in the main rental centre or wait and find something closer to my hotel.Worst car rental in Vegas. No effort to wipe down after washing, water marks and dirty interior. Very, very bad customer service. Beware of agent adding coverages to contract without explaining anything.  Supervisor Damien was worst of all. Cheap but they will try to deceive you. I'll never use them ever again.Ketchup on Dough! They basically serve cooked dough with what they call sauce and very little of it! The soup was eatable but cold! The sauce for the pasta, well I had better using Ragu out of the bottle (nasty!) To top it off I was overcharged by a very arrogant nasty cashier/manager! I wrote directly to them twice trying to resolve the problem with this nasty manager and got no results! I will definitely NOT be going back there! Their are way to many places to eat that have much better food and treat you a lot nicer!They don't honor their own posted policies!!

They claim to match competitor prices, but apparently only if they will still make money on the deal.

They claim to offer free shipping, but apparently only if they make money on the deal.

Here is the story... Labor day weekend sales are in full effect and the sales are posted.  We head over to Pacific Sales after checking out a few deals online at major stores.  We find a Samsung refrigerator we like and ask if they will match Sears' pricing which was about $200 cheaper.  The salesman (who was very nice) goes to check online to confirm the price and comes back and tells us they can.  

We leave to go check things out at the Sears Outlet store, because I of course want to see if I can get a better deal on something that is maybe scratched or dented a little... nothing there so we head back to Pacific Sales within an hour.

As we are looking around again we see the bigger version of the same Samsung refrigerator.  So I pull out my trusty smart phone to see if Sears has that one on sale, and they do!  So I show  the same salesman that price and he again goes to look it up.  He comes back and says, "give me just a minute, ok?"  and disappears for a few min again.  

When he comes back, he says "So that price is less than our cost, so here is what I can do.  We will honor that price, but we have to charge you $79 for the delivery, which will keep it the same price you will get it for at Sears because you will have to pay for delivery from them if you get it there."  

So I ask, "but you say you have free delivery right? And you say you match competitors prices right?  So why do I have to pay delivery?  The whole reason I came here for the matched price is because I knew I would save the delivery fee."

- "Well, we would be losing money on that price." was his response.
- "So you are going to let me go to Sears and buy it over $79?" I say
- "If thats what you need to do" he says.

I was under the impression that the idea of having a price matching policy was that even if you had to lose a little money on a deal, the customer will come back and buy more items and tell his friends to do the same.  Well, let me tell ya, they did the complete opposite this time.  We were buying appliances for a new home and still need to buy some.  You can guarantee that I won't be getting them from Pacific Sales.

I will also not be telling any friends to go there, if they aren't honest enough to follow their posted policies, what will they do to you when you have a delivery issue or something.  I cannot send anyone there.

Finally, we went to Sears, got the fridge for the price they advertised and the salesman even through in a $50 discount on top of that.  So really, we only paid $29 for delivery and felt good about giving our money to them rather than Pacific Sales.

By the way, both salesmen we spoke with were very nice, and the selection was quite good on all appliances.  Too bad I can never go back.I can't give a zero star review because it won't let me. I'm writing this while I'm waiting in the exam room. Called, received a 1130am appt. Arrived by 1115am, it's 1230pm and still haven't been seen. All I need is a new prescription for my allergies.Went there years ago and it was great. Never had a problem. Went in today and the office looked run down and unprofessional.  I was just there for a prescription refill. After showing the Dr. my prescription bottles of very mild mediction she refused to give me the full thing saying she wasn't sure how I'd react. I've been taking these for over two years after getting these original prescriptions from specialists. I know what works best for me and I had proof with the bottles as well as my medical records. She continued to talk to me like I had no idea how or when to take them. She made me feel like I was some kind of addict. She recommended something else and I said no because I don't like the "high" feeling from other medications for my condition. I would never recommend them to anyone again ever.So, I used to come here often, but now I am never going back.

I went in today to pick up some chicken salad and some groceries for dinner. I walked over to the deli area, looking around for what I'd like and while I'm looking, I took a picture of my shirt for a friend, and send it to him. Then this little woman from the deli walks over to me and says "hey, excuse me, who are you and why are you taking pictures?" in a very rude tone! I was stunned at first and could only mutter "..of myself??" and she says "well I wanna know who you think you are and why you're taking pictures of my shelf" and walked away.. I couldn't believe it! I got my chicken salad and went to grab a basket for my groceries, and she started following me!! By this point, I was starting to get really embarrassed, but I wanted to get my stuff and go. As I am walking down the isles, she continues to follow me until "manager" Lisa tells me I can't be taking pictures of the store and calls me out in front of everyone, at no point did anyone ask me what I was doing, or apologize for stalking me, they just decided to embarrass me and make me never want to come back ever again.

After that, I bought just the chicken salad and almost ran out of the store, tears in my eyes from embarrassment. 

I will never shop at any Albertsons again.I'm going to beg my company to allow me to go to another pharmacy.  The pharmacists are nice enough but the rest of the pharmacy staff is inept and often rude as hell.  I wish drug dealers sold lipitor, as I would much rather traverse the fêted underbelly of Las Vegas to obtain my prescription than to ever again step foot into this idiot-infested Hooverville.I tried these guys out a few times and I will most certainly not be back. The few times I had work done they really put on the hard-sell for service I did not need. On top of that, they recommended replacing parts that had been replaced less than 6 months ago (which I verified with another mechanic a few days later). Just an FYI, always consult your vehicles owners manual for the recommended service intervals for the different parts of your car. 

During my last and final visit here, the manager's demeanor was very unprofessional. I asked for an oil change and a tire rotation. When I returned to pick up my car, the tires had not been rotated and the service associate at the front desk started arguing with me and said they had. I usually do most of my own automotive maintenance but if I don't have time and need to take a vehicle in for service, there are a few things I do beforehand to make sure the service was completed correctly. On this particular occasion, I marked the sidewalls of both rear tires with a Sharpie (permanent marker) so I could verify that the tires had been rotated. It was only after showing the sales associate how I knew they had not been rotated did he go and ask the mechanic if they had been done or not.

Let me be clear, I know mistakes happen and things can be overlooked but arguing with a customer before verifying with the mechanic if a service was completed or not is something I deem unacceptable.This place is not good. Tacos el gordo is better, I do better tacos, my lunch lady in Mansfield Mass in 1995 did better tacos. I would really have to order Tacos el Gordo and then take it into this place, make an identical order and really eat slowly , a little bit of each and find out what this place is missing. I'm not even going to read the other reviews on here, cuz I just don't see the 3.5 star rating....don't go here, try Rubalcabas down the road or Tacos El Gordo ! Don't eat here. You'll be fine without this place.Worst fast food I've ever had. The first time I came here, I ordered a combo. The only thing I could eat was the biscuit. My four year old, too. So, today I came back for a biscuit and the drive thru guy asks me if I want my change! Since when is that optional? Then I needed a knife to spread the butter, but he wouldn't come back to the window so I could ask for one. Never returning.the worst service provider anyone can ever deal with!!!!!!!   i hate this lying cheating stupid place.   i will never ever ever get cox again!!!!!  When returning my equipment they said i owed 300 dollars after waisting 45 minutes m 2 managers later i was right n i only owed 107??????  Customers B WARE!!!!  This company scams ppl n their system is designed to scam u so pay attention!!!!!I visited yesterday to look for a storage unit. The sign outside indicates a number of sizes available and rates. I walked in and asked for a rate sheet. The girl at the front desk stated that she did not have one, but that she would write down the rates of the sizes I was interested in. 

Me: "How significantly different are the 5x7 and the 7x10?"

Her: "About 2 feet."

What?

Here are several options for what I would consider to be appropriate responses:

1. A lot of people get the 5x7, but end up deciding it's too small and upgrade to the 7x10.

or

2. Let's talk about what you plan to store and we can help determine what size is best for you.

or 

3. Why don't we go look at them and you can get a feel for what the sizes mean.

I didn't need a math lesson. I can do math. I needed simple common courtesy or even basic customer service. I told her that her answer was rude and started to turn to walk out because if service starts off poor, I am not going to stay. I turned to look at her again, and she had a look of shock on her face. I told her that was basic math, and that I could do math. She continued to look surprised and defended her glib, non-service oriented answer. 

Perhaps I should lower my expectations for service. She was working the front desk at a storage unit. She probably didn't go through years of customer service training. I don't know. I just know that when it starts bad, it's going to be bad. I won't be going back and will be checking out other options in the neighborhood.Not very impressed!  It was a confusing set up.....white table cloths but self service?  Placed orders that they could not seem to get right.....took a long time to get food yet not very busy....some orders still messed up.  Drove here from S. Phoenix but will not be back!This place is horrible, trust them with nothing.Again, another two weeks have passed since I went into the dealership to complain in person after I was repeatedly dismissed and not help through email or over the phone. I spoke with Tina Escoto in management of the service department. Again, very nice, but as useful as tits on a bull.  I was told to follow her to several different departments to get to the bottom of this problem (it's a missing wheel cap that you guys lost, this is not a difficult problem to remedy) and everyone in "management" positions seemed to be perplexed with the problem.  The answer I received as to why they weren't yet able to replace it was simply that "the parts department manager couldn't figure out how to order the part online". Strange, I did one Google search at it yielded over ten third party retailers that sold the piece for less than $60, yet these so called professionals aren't able to do this on their own. Called two more times, since they never called me back as promised. Still have yet to have the issue resolved. Going on about 4 months now. THIS IS A RIDICULOUS ESTABLISHMENT!!!! SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE AND INCONVENIENCE OF DEALING WITH CHAPMAN CHRYSLER .... go ahead and give them a call, when you are on hold, the company song they play when you are on hold (which is always a prolonged period of time) says it all, a COMPLETE JOKEI used this service to get back and forth from the airport for $12 a person and I suppose you get what you pay for.  

The pickup area is jam packed with travelers and it's a big zoo like you would imagine Vegas to be.

The service was standard, however, the most annoying part of the ride was the "guide" if I can call him that.  I felt like I was in some horrible comedy club at the mercy of this person's terrible jokes.  I was annoyed by the end of trip and I don't think I would ever use this service again.  I would rather pay more.Not even the hungriest, rabid infested pack of Chihuahuas would touch this food. All their food is canned process nonsense. It's like Mc Donalds on Mescaline. Now the freshly made tortillas are good, but that's it.We called to confirm price AND went online for estimates. The dispatcher told us it would be less than $15. We got to our destination the clock said 10.50 but they said they had to charge us an additional $12! He blamed it on a new dispatcher. Sorry that is not our problem. We will choose another company next time.Hmmmm, that's interesting. I wrote a scathing review about Lazybones on Friday. It is now posted in the filtered reviews. Please read! This is a terrible company.Bill our server was terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!It's taken me many months to get around to writing this but I can't seem to stop thinking about it...so I'm compelled make this known by ALL who will read it. This restaurant to had decent Thai food and the service was just ok. That would have been fine had the waiter not taken the liberty of changing the amount of the tip I indicated on my Visa receipt. When I reviewed my statement online and discovered he had done that, I printed the statement and took it and the receipt (as proof) back to the restaurant to explain what happened to the manager. The manager refunded my entire tip in cash. Some would say that should have solved it, but for some reason the manager's reaction to the incident wasn't what I had hoped for. It felt more like he wanted me to simply go away with cash rather than regain my confidence as a customer. I went with what it felt like. Haven't been back and will likely NEVER return.Este restaurante lo unico que tiene de Guadalajara es el nombre.  Todo es comida chicana muy malita.  En el escusado habia un hombre semi desnudo aseandose...que asco. 

Verguenza ajenaWaitstaff suck... Unless you have testicles. I love Hooters wings, I won't be back to this Hooters.My wife went to Cali nails to get manicure and pedicure with gel, they are extremely rude and way overcharge! Then the finished product was crappy. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Nails were crooked told me my fingers were crooked bubbled gel polish whole nail not even polishedI wasn't even going to give one star, but the Mac&Cheese was amazing.
As for the staff, my suggestion is to get rid of the entire staff that is presently employed there, and rehire all new people. Start over.
You would think that with a name like Alice Cooper behind you, that the team would be amazing and go out of their way to have pride in their establishment and offer a good experience. We went here before a RUSH concert in November, and it was absolutely the worst customer service we have all four ever experienced.... And we are from Tucson, and were so excited to stop for drinks and dinner before our show.
The guy waiting on us was very impatient, and very huffy. Complaining about the busyness.  And at the table next to us, their waitress complained to her customers that "she was very busy, and would get them what they needed when she could", while raising her voice about three levels.
Horrible experience.Rude managers combined with a shabby hotel in a sketchy neighborhood.  Apparently these folks haven't realized that we're in a recession and if they want to keep their business they need to cater to customers instead of being rude to them. The manager was one of the rudest employees I have EVER encountered.  I wouldn't stay here again if you paid me.Historic, yes. Worth the visit, no.

Problem 1: Hosting a political event without warning during the Saturday lunch hour.  No signs on the outside, no warning until we're in and heading for the table, and we realize, "There's a guy, stumping for Mayor of Phoenix, and he's going to just talk the entire lunch hour."  So this means we can either enjoy conversation with our friends or we can sit and eat quietly while an unelected politician tells us why we shouldn't trust elected politicians.

Problem 2: Very dry chicken.  Seriously, I think they stuck a frozen Wal-Mart chicken breast in the microwave and nuked it for 8 minutes or something.  How hard is it to make a chicken sandwich taste good?  So now I get to try to choke down dry chicken and terrible political speeches at the same time.

Problem 3:  The candidate finally quits talking.  Then he takes a photo standing between the waitresses and says, "It's like beauty on the outside, and beast on the inside."  No one laughs.  But then the owner comes up to our table as we're finally getting the chance to talk to each other, and she spends another 15 minutes telling us why we should vote for a certain party and why she wants to move into Phoenix from her home in Fountain Hills.  My favorite line: "We need to make it harder for folks to drive so that they start using public transportation."  But of course, she's not using the light rail on her way in from Fountain Hills.  She just wants the people off her streets when she's trying to drive in and out of the city.

The only good thing about the whole trip--apart from our friends, who are awesome--was that the waitresses were professional and competent.  They earned a good tip and they treated us well.My boyfriend and I recently visited this bar because we just moved into the area. The moment we walked in the bartenders were rude and unfriendly. They asked for our       IDs and they were whispering and rolling their eyes at us even though we are both 23. We ordered a pitcher of beer and both of the bartenders went into the back to get glasses and came out with glasses that were sticky with lipstick and seemed as if they hadn't even been washed.  We didn't even end up drinking the entire pitcher since the glasses and pitcher were so dirty and sticky. No matter how close this bar is to us we will never go back. They were rude and wrongly rude and disgusting to usEven though it is only $6 to get in, this is so old school.  They hand you a 3 ring binder to take you through the tour.  They do not have information cards at each fire truck.  You have to read this small print in the 3 ring binder while minding your children.  The old guy at the front desk was grouchy on top of it all.  Don't waste your money.  Make a donation to the fallen fire fighters instead.Tried the kung pao shrimp and veg chow mien. Nothing great. Service was also not good. Although I did go just before it closes. Even then I asked if you guys are still serving and would have been more than satisfied if they denied service. Looking at all the reviews. I might just try it again. But for now.... NOT Satisfied.Eek! Methinks not.... this clearly doesn't describe this place.  Eek! Foodpoisoning Ahead.  That would paint a picture like Bob Ross on this damn place.  1 out of the 8 beef mini chimichangas had chicken...  I think it was chicken, it's been awhile since I have tasted rancid meat... but it's a taste you don't forget.  The waitress didn't check on the food after we received it, manager ignored me at first and then asked me if he could get me something else.... didn't want me leaving "hungry."  Don't worry... hunger is that last thing on my mind.  I told a group coming in that is isn't too late to turn around... they will probably read this later, so... I told you so.READ THIS REVIEW..... if you are willing to do the following:
1) support a local business
2) have a knack for bitter and angry women
3) take time of work... meaning a whole day of work 
4) be on call and not do anything until they come to your home
5) be hung up on
6) PAY for crappy service...


a lady from this 7 person office calls me in reference to a service that was schedule between 1-4 pm , this was per the property manager.. However there was a miscommunication between the business and the manager all I knew was it was between 1pm to 4pm.
i was on my way to the house to take care of the issue .. Before i forget to mention this ... 
A lady calls me at 12:50 asking me how far was I from the home ... i answered give me 15 minutes (I was still thinking about the 1-4pm time slot) she then said you know this is not going to happen , the property manger this the property manager that ... this is ridiculous and you guys should've been there and went on and on and on and on ... and she was on my cars bluetooth on blast with my 11 and 9 year.... and  i said well i apologize for that i will there as soon as possible.. then she said .. no... its not going to happen ma'am not today ... this is not going to happen ma'am .. she uses the word ma'am like she was to say *insert profanity here* , then i asked how can we resolve this maybe  if we can work on rescheduling (first of all WHY am I as the consumer would be trying to make things work when she was standoffish to begin with? IDK maybe i am still hoping for world peace) ... and she was like ugh no I need to call American Home Shield and the owner I don't know this is ridiculous.. and I asked well can we get a time maybe for next week and then call us if its possible or not and she NO MA'AM I AM NOT GOING TO THAT all loud ..... and asked ... excuse me did I say something to offend you???  and here goes........SHE HUNG UP! i called back and she said YES I HUNG UP ON YOU and hung up again !

I was disappointed with the property manager and made sure he knew I felt, however Angry lady's action was uncalled for... wow ,now i know why some people pay a premium for larger companies ... since this will not be tolerated.


When i read the review from Mollie C .... why am I not surprised?

The following has been done:
1) filed an executive complaint with the BBB
2) a copy was sent to American Home Shield and the FTC , just in case this company tries to make a quick buck....and ask for the $75 deductible 
2) a letter to Mr. Little , the owner and according to the grumpy lady on the phone he was the "technician" he that was waiting.... 
do 

I guess if the owner of the company is performing the service .. you need to bow down to him ... its like the president of the United states is doing you a favor and exempted all taxes due for you and your family....SCORE!

this is the worst service I have received .. better yet treatment from a COMPLETE stranger.Worst experience ever!  I am a fan of Richardson's so I thought we should check this place out.  Stopped in on a Friday night around 8pm without reservations just to see how long the wait would be.  Great host at the door greeted us and was really friendly.  He said there was over an hour wait upstairs but we could try our chances downstairs where it was all open seating.  We headed downstairs, grabbed a couple glasses of wine and waited for seats to open up.  We waited quite a long time for a table and multiple groups were able to grab seats before us, so we saw a couple ladies paying their  tab and asked if we could get their seats when they were ready to leave.  We ended up talking to them for a while before they left.  When we went to sit down, a very unfriendly brunette bartender said this other couple had been waiting longer and were next on "the list".  The other couple was already sitting!  She gave them our seats  at the bar and someone else who had just walked in grabbed their chairs.  I'll never be back.  If there's a list, tell the door guy and offer people to put their names on it when they arrive.  And if that couple needed to sit at the bar so bad, I would have been fine with the table.  Customer service is obviously lost on this place (except the sweet door host.  Worst experience I've had in a long time.  Contrary to my efforts to calmly explain to the bartender, she did nothing to resolve the issue.This place is old, furniture is ugly, rooms are dark and smelly. Add to that the manager was really rude... this was the worst part of the phoenix trip for me.I arrived on time for my appointment and had to sit in the waiting room for over  a half hour with a blaring kids  movie playing on the waiting room television.  The waiting room was not very clean and the furniture was worn and outdated.  While I was waiting, people were being rushed out the door who had just had their Lasik procedure done.  The staff were walking them out telling them their aftercare plan in front of the whole waiting room.  When the "sales girl" finally called me back into a room she did not apologize for the wait.  She only said, "this is surgery day.  We are busy.  We tried calling to reschedule you (I received no such call). Then she made me look into a machine while she looked at my eyes for about ten seconds.  She then led me to her sales office to talk pricing. She gave a very lengthy sales pitch and did a poor job pretending to listen to my concerns. I am nervous about having this procedure done and she made me more nervous.  She made it seemed like I needed to have the procedure done ASAP before my eyes got worse.  Then she made a morbid comparison to Lasik being equivalent to cutting her finger off.  Then she pushed a finger down and modeled to me what her hand would like missing a finger.  She would not offer specifics on pricing and kept throwing out numbers and percentages.  She made me feel rushed and like I had to decide today if I was going to go with them for the procedure. She discouraged me from using another form of payment other than their financing and kept throwing percentage rates around as to why she was right.  I asked for documentation stating the pricing and discounts available to me and she declined to produce any such document stating, "This is not like buying a car.  I am not giving you any written pricing.  Anyway, the pricing changes all the time.  These are your eyes we are talking about and you only have two (like I didn't know that)."  She created a huge sense of urgency with getting the procedure done and kept repeating, "You only have two eyes."  She kept telling me what "most people" do, which is pay the day of the consultation and get the procedure done the following week.  She also told me she needed a $100 deposit before I left today if I decided to go with them.  I told her that her sales pitch was making me feel uncomfortable and rushed as I am in the early stages of exploring this procedure.  She became offended, defensive, and moody claiming it was not a sales pitch and that "I only have two eyes." She would not even continue the consultation and have my eyes tested to see if I was even a "candidate" for Lasik without my committing to pay.  I then said that I felt their company was not a good fit for me and she led me out.  I do not recommend this company based on my consultation experience.  I would not trust them with the actual procedure because they seem very concerned with getting people in and out of there as fast as they can to make $$$! If you do get the procedure done at this place, you should not pay more than around $1500 per eye because that's the final price I was verbally quoted at my consultation.  But, like the "sales lady" said...prices are always changing! This company needs to train their sales people on how to effectively communicate with clients, build trust, and be empathetic!! Oh, and give clients documents on pricing!They serve Pepsi.  Got horribly sick about 30 minutes after I finished my meal.Ok, seriously, I gave this place 1 star but only because they have my favorite Irish Ale on tap - and they should because it's an Irish pub.  I suppose it would be an "okay" place if you want to hang out in a neighborhood bar and play pool and/or video games and drink at a mediocre price.  I read on their white board that they have a live blues band a couple of nights a week (Fri/Sat maybe?), which, if they're decent, could be pretty cool.

Anyway, let me walk you through my experience...

It's Tuesday night and my friends want to go to a karaoke place.  Why they chose this place I will never know.  I was actually a little scared when we walked up.  Some of the patrons were outside smoking and they looked a little rough around the edges.  Now, I'm really not one to judge based solely on appearance, but...  I digress.

The bar itself is laid back.  Wood paneling, some high tables, low tables, long bar with stools.  Plenty of room for big groups.  I would say there were a couple dozen people there which is pretty good for a Tuesday night.  I didn't visit the bathroom because I was scared to see what it looked like.

The bartender was just ok.  I got my first drink (draft beer) pretty quickly.  However, when I went up to the bar for a second beer, the bartender was nowhere to be found.  I stood there for about 10 minutes.  She finally came back in after her smoke break and poured me a beer.  I still tipped her because that's how I roll.

The karaoke was AWFUL.  The song selection was large, but I couldn't seem to find any of my regular songs, which are popular hip-hop songs from the current decade.  If you're into singing Limp Bizkit, Metallica, Pantera and other songs from way back in the day, this place is definitely for you.  You will be entertained by middle-aged obese men moshing next to their table and growling into the microphone, while the host either sings uninvited backup or makes out with her boyfriend.  But that's not even the best part.

My friends and I wanted to sing a specific song and the host overheard us.  She said cool.  We tipped her (heavily) so she would move us up in the rotation.  We waited about 20 minutes.  Then, she came over and said she didn't have that song.  Surprise.  We asked her to move our other songs up in the rotation and she said no problem, but she did ask me to change my selection (?) for some reason.  I didn't and I really wish I could have gotten my money back.

It's the most ridiculous karaoke experience I have ever had in my life and I won't be repeating it... ever.  I guess that's what I get for going to a local Irish pub to do karaoke!Awful! My Mom and I decided to stop in and each have a taco with an iced tea. I ordered lemon with my tea. My tea was served with a lemon as requested but it had a long dark hair wrapped around the lemon. I told the server and he had the nerve to bring me another one, also with a lemon (it should have at least been on the side after that!). After that, our tacos were not so appetizing! The kicker? Our server still charged us for my beverage! We went to pay our bill and had to actually get the manager to take off the tea from our bill. The manager offered no apologies and seemed to smirking about it. All's he said was "These guys no better than that"! Too bad because my boyfriend loves this place. Accidents happen but it is how it was handled......never again!Ok so I was going to a movie and I really wanted a coffee.

The nearest thing was coffee plantation.

I got a cup, one sip and I was the keystone bitter beer face guy!

This coffee was like if Propel made coffee water.

This was the most watered down coffee I've ever tasted in my life.

NEVER DRINK IT!!Meh, for sure. Since we were staying at the hotel we thought we'd pop over for a drink and light app. What a weird space! Here we are, in the middle of a desert with gorgeous views, land, and sky to see, and this dungeon is what we have available to us.

Service was fine. The bartendress was nice. The food selection sucked, and our cheese platter was sub-par. What a waste of space.Adam took me to "a different point of view" to celebrate my birthday. Super nice. Beautiful view. 

We get there and there are about 3 weddings going on. Enter the lobby and they tell us we can wait for our table in lobby. We see some people with drinks but don't see a bar. So I ask hostess if there is a bar. "Not tonight because there is a wedding just go wait in lobby " That's kinda strange we think to ourselves, but  then it gets even weirder. As we are sitting in lobby as older couple sits down next to us and a server came and welcomed them and brought them each a glass of wine. We were completely ignored. 

We were lead to our table (which was not a window view as Adam requested). We notice some waitstaff taking a rug and putting it over something right next to us. At that point we realize that they are using the rug to cover up vomit. 

After a few minutes we notice there were a lot of high school kids having dinner before prom. One of the tables of them right next to us was so drunk the girl threw up! I immediately get up to tell the hostess I want to be moved and notice a vomit trail all the way to the bathroom. 

We were relocated to a table in the very back of restaurant. Service was slow and inattentive. The guy knew I was gluten free because I had a few questions. Dinner was good. 

After dinner. Waiter brought by dessert menus. We wanted to order something but he never came back. 10 minutes later he came back over and asked us what we wanted. I replied "we would have ordered something 5 minutes ago but now we will just take our check. ". 

They knew it was my birthday because Adam had written it on opentable. The guy came back with a birthday dessert and slammed it on the table with zero comments. No candles. Nothing. And it was the most gluten containing dessert option they has. Let me say that the people across from us got candles and a different dessert that I could have eaten. 

Took 20 more minutes after this for us to finally get our check. 

Horrible experience for such a special occasion.How can a eatery get mexican food SO wrong?!!

I had a bad feeling when I walked in and the lady was looking at us like "what are you doing here!?!!!?  Don't you know the food sucks and you will get sick???"

Well.. I got a fajita burrito and the peppers and onions were boiled.  The chicken was bland. My girl's tacos were crummy too.

If ever a reason to go there I guess the chips and salsa are ok. That would give it a star. But otherwise... I would never advise this place.  Sorry. I hate to be mean. I always try to find something good about an eatery. This place was hard to find anything good.If I could rate 0 I would.
I called at 10:55 to place an order the guy answers and says can u call back when we're open and hangs up.
I call exactly at 10:59 to place an order I go pick up my I take it back to have lunch this pizza is so salty. I couldn't eat it.Ugg the worst costumer service EVER!! And not only this place... They do not hire any competent people what so ever... even their managers. I had to order a bridesmaid dress since the girl at the Tucson location was incompetent. After 4 days passed its supposed arrival (wedding approaching in a week), and not receiving it (freaking out), I called to see where it could be. Called at 11 am for the mailing tracking number... it took the manager until 8pm!!! to get back to me for a freaking tracking number. On top of that, they ended up sending me two of the same dress... just so I can keep dealing with these morons.My last trip on Monday the 14th was not very good.  I sat in the bar and just wanted to grab a quick burger and beer.  The bar was pretty empty, even though Monday Night Football was on.  I sat down and after a few minutes the bartender came over and I ordered a Fat Tire.  He tells me that they don't have Fat Tire but they have some other beer and that it tastes JUST LIKE Fat Tire.  I passed on his recommendation and went with a Kilt Lifter - he seemed pissed that I didn't go with his recommendation.  

I ordered a burger and he said "you want it cooked medium right?"  Typically I would say thats a little presumptuous but hey its Islands not Morton's.  The burger came out and was maybe mid-rare, closer to rare and was very greasy.  The bartender asked about 10 seconds after he delivered the food if "Everything looks OK".  I said sure it does and he never stopped back to refill my beer, ask if I wanted a water, or ask how the burger was.  He was busy talking to his girlfriend who was also working.  

I ate about 1/2 of the burger and asked for the check.  The bartender brought the check and didn't say a word, or ask why I only at about 1/2 of the burger.  Overall a very disappointing experience.Okay, I'm not one to usually flame places, but they deserve it!!
I had about the worst experience EVER at Shogun, and I didn't even get a chance to try their food!
Went a few Saturdays back for lunch with a friend.  Upon arriving a harried guy told us to just sit anywhere, which we did.  We were catching up and after a bit realized that ~15 minutes had elapsed since we sat down.  No menus, no 'can I get you a drink', nothing.  We sheepishly looked around for our host who was nowhere to be found.  There were some occupied tables, but I would not classify it as 'busy' by any means.
I flagged down a sweaty waiter who said that everyone had called in sick and he was doing his best to keep up.  He brought us both iced tea, which we did not order nor did we really want.  Still no menus.
After half an hour of sitting there Mr. Sweaty threw menus on our table and assured us he would be right back.  He kept this promise and took our orders.  Tick tock Clarice....
AFTER A SOLID FRICKIN' HOUR we just left.Mystery Theater was cute and funny. Food was aweful and very bland.I will not be ordering from here again. The only good thing I ordered was the cream cheese wontons. All of the vegetables had a really funky taste, and the garlic chicken had no garlic flavor.Purchased a deal through Expedia and was EXTREMELY disappointed with my stay here!! Do yourself a favor and AVOID this hotel. You are better off staying at a Motel 6. 
Upon checking in, it seemed as though Expedia had messed up in this case. I had made reservations for 2 beds but had one bed which was not the hotels fault, and the guy at the front changed right away... 5 stars for this. When going into the room, I had noticed an empty half-and-half and an old water bottle by the bed. At this point we were way too tired to care or complain about this. The next morning I had found out that I only had breakfast for 2 which I had for singed up for 4 on Expedia. The manager at the restaurant took care of this for the first morning after they had embarrassed me in front of my guests, but our amazing waiter Ron made up for this so Ron gets 5 stars. We got back to the hotel room and I had not noticed this before but the blanket was stained!! So gross so at this point I had enough. I had called Expedia which they told me to make a complaint with the hotel and then went down to speak to the manager, Jackie. Jackie had a "wonderful resolution", she told me I can call Expedia and ask them to relocate me! Seriously?!!! And this is at a Hilton?!! Great customer service....I seriously don't know why this woman went into a career in hospitality but obviously should not be in this line of work. In conclusion, I have realized that Hilton's standards have gone down the toilet and to stay away from this hotel at all costs. The only redeeming part was our waiter Ron.If you want Mexican food that tastes like it was bought off of a street vendor in Piedras Negras, then this is your place. 

I give this place one star for being a step above cat food. Awful, awful, awful!!!One star for their great service. Food was the worst BBQ ever, horrible, ribs were rare?  Yes pink stuck to the bone not done, threw them away.   Expensive and horrible food.I will never fly through here again.

Besides being a poorly designed airport where to make a connecting flight you have to leave the airport via zigzagging and try to catch a shuttle (20 rental shuttle buses to 1 airport shuttle) to the next terminal and face going through security all over again.

Security only had 2 lines and if your bag needs to be checked, there is only 1 guy there to do the exam, and he does it slowly.

We barely made our flight after they called last call.

Who cares about free wifi when you're desperately trying to run from one terminal to another??  There's next to no time to grab food or use the bathroom as you're struggling to throw on your shoes and stuff your liquids back in your bag in order to awkwardly run with your luggage to the plane huffing and puffing.Ive been craving udon and ramen probably for the last month or so. While I was in Awatukee today I saw this place in the shopping center I was visiting. Oh yeah, this is going to hit the spot!

You know when you're in trouble when you go in and the place is empty. Continuing in I saw udon on the menu board.. my cravings overrode my sensibility to leave, oh how do I hate my cravings. Got to the counter and couldn't stop myself.. order the shrimp tempura udon. After about 3 minutes later the smallest of bowls appeared.. can you call something this small a bowl, more like a bo since far to small to use the whole word. 

Well instead of griping about paying 7 bucks plus tax for my bo of udon cravings took over again! I tried the broth first.. hmmm, pretty unimaginative.. for whatever reason I though it was going to be good, just salty.. the shrimp, gummy and soup logged.. okay here comes the udon!!! Like eating rubber bands.. tough, chewy and actually kind of strange. The only thing that was decent about the bo was these little pink and white half slices.. very chewy and pretty cool texture.. I would have rather had a bowl of those then anything else in the bo in front of me. 

After about 5 bites I threw it out and left.. still craving good udon or ramen.. any ideas? Please!!!The first time we went to Rock Bottom (how fitting a name), the hostess sat us next to a table with three screaming kids right next to where the servers enter and exit the kitchen. The waiter came by after a few minutes, took our drink order and then actually snatched the menus out of hands. He brought us our drinks and promptly walked away. The floor manager came by and we told her what happened. She reprimanded the waiter in front of us and gave us two discount cards for our next visit and comped our beers. The food wasn't great by any stretch of the imagination. So little so that I don't remember what we ordered.

We decided to use our discount cards for a second trip. We were sat once again in a far corner by the kitchen. The waiter took our drink order and food order together and instead of bringing out our drinks and then our food, just waited until our food was done cooking to bring out the drinks as well. I ordered the lobster enchiladas which was about $18 (US) because on the menu it sounded tasty. On the plate it looked like a used deflated diaper. The enchiladas were TINY. I asked the waiter if that was what it was supposed to look like because it didn't look like $18 worth of food. The chef that made it came out with an attitude and said, "You should have asked about the portion before we wasted all that lobster." To which I responded, "What lobster? There isn't a lobster tank in here which means you pulled it from a can." I have never been treated so rudely. The floor manager apologized however refused to defuse our anger because the previous manager comped our beers and gave us $20 off our next meal which he felt was more than kind enough a gesture.

So if you want Rock Bottom quality food with Rock Bottom service at sky high prices then this is your stop. For those of you who read this review this far: NOT A WORD OF THIS HAS BEEN EXAGGERATED. We are never coming back here.
Right across the parking lot are better places with better food on similar menus, The Keg, BJ's, and Wolfley's.Terrible ER.  Maybe the staff in other areas is decent but the ER is just awful.  I've been there three times - each time, the wait was 4 hours +, the admitting nurses were rude, the 'nurse assistants' which you see instead of a real doctor were uninterested in helping, and you only see an actual doctor for less than a minute.  Oh, and they do everything they can to avoid running tests.

I went in for chest pains and it took them 4 hours to give me a breathing treatment, which they did without ever running a single test to see what the problem was.  I went in for a stomach issue and they attempted to give me a medication I'm allergic to - when I said I wouldn't take it, they had a doctor come in to try to talk me into it.  Hello, ALLERGY!

I could go on and on, because they're terrible every step of the way, but no tests + no doctors pretty much sums it up.死八婆  made me wait 30 minutes for some pan fried noodles and fried rice.Have to say this use to be a fairly decent restaurant, it seems however, when they removed some of their better meals from the menu, they also removed the flavor and customer service, bad food, bad service, sorry to say it was our last visit!I didn't even want to give one star. I don't know what happened to Nypd. I placed my order and they had to call me back to tell me they don't make a certain item anymore. I read it right off there website, they need to update their menu. Nypd use to be my favorite place to get pizza, not anymore. To make matters worse they charged me extra for getting a similar dish and didn't tell me, intern the delivery boy didn't get a big enough tip since I was paying with all the cash I had on me. I felt so bad! Nypd need to clean up their act!So after reading great reviews on yelp I decided to try this place out. I have tried many different nail salons in the valley but never been satisfied. Whenever I get a chance to go visit So Cal I get my nails done there. Otherwise, I just do my own nails at home. Nail tech that worked on me was a male and he manhandled my hands. He was so rough and over did it with his nail file drill even after I told him my nails are very thin so he needed to be extra careful. I even yelped out few times because he was putting too much pressure on my nails. After I got home my finger tips were throbbing so bad I couldn't even zip or button my pants or touch anything. Took ibuprofen for couple days till the pain subsided. Finished work looked sloppy and acrylic is already lifting off my nails. I will never go back to this place.This place sucks...i brought four shirts to get dry cleaned. They could not get any of the stains out. i made four separate trips back for re dos, still no good. They come back wrinkly and they do not check to see if stains are out so be sure to check before you leave. First time returning I found a slight burn mark on a  Lacoste polo and new stains on an express button down. They also seem to have difficulty finding your clothes on their racks as well.... I noticed another customer had the same issue with stains while i was there to pick up.....By my fourth trip they were able to get the stains/ burn marks out but the original stains were still there. They refunded me with cash. 

Bottom line go somewhere else.I walked up while the manager was cashiering. He was talking.inappropriately about a girl who.asked for an application and made it very awkward when ordering. I dont appreciate sexist people so I'll order from Auntie Anns now.The ambiance was promising when we all arrived.  It was suggested that the prime rib would be the best option so I ordered the 7 oz, medium (using their menu-rankings and descriptions as a guide), plus the usual sides.

What I got was essentially steak tartar, with a millimeter-thick quick sear on the outside.  On first bite I wasn't sure what I was eating, so I had a second.  Then it became apparent that the middle of the steak was not only rare, it was completely raw .. basically refrigerator-cold to the tongue.

So, steak sashimi not being what I wanted I waited for the server to return.  This didn't happen so I got up and went searching through the restaurant, to no avail.  I finally just stood in the middle of a busy intersection until one passed by, and explained the situation.  He could not find our server either so agreed to take it back for 'reheating'.

A few minutes later someone higher up came and apologized and said another would would be right up.  The rest of our party continued to dine while I sat there with no dining whatsoever, no refills on water/drink etc.  About 20 minutes later my food arrived (45 mins after ordering), and everyone else was most way through theirs.  

With wine glass completely empty, no service for refills forthcoming, I proceeded into steak #2 with just a glass of water.

Steak #2 was marginally better, but in lieu of medium it was just well done on the outer ring and again, all-rare tartar in the middle.

I gave up after a few bites, just surrendered the meal altogether and just went to a taco take-out on the way back to the hotel.

I didn't do an exhaustive review of the check but it did not look like anything was comped, though the restaurant put in a $25 gift card for a future visit.  This I regarded as a final insult, as I have no desire to return to this place and in lieu of making up for the bad meal and poor service, the only apparent apology is an invitation to come back and do it all over again.

I hope others have a better experience.I went around lunch time and it was pretty busy. My husband went to wait in line while I went to find a table (this is a seat yourself restaurant). I am 8 months pregnant and was holding my upset 2 year old. I waited patiently for people to leave a table and then, completely exhausted, sat down with my son. The manager told me I had to get up and wait longer because there were others waiting in front of me. I understand that there are others waiting, but sometimes common courtesy should trump order. Especially when it is seat yourself, and you're telling a super pregnant woman she has to get up with her toddler. Shame on that manager. The food wasn't worth it. I would have left but my son was starving. All the meat tastes chewy like it has a layer of fat around each bite. I'm never going back.You would think with the economy as bad as it is service would be a priority! One guy rolled his eyes after he brought me the wrong food! Another argued with me once! I used to be a regular! Love there awesome balsam salad! Unfortunately they have been RUDE too many times! I am no longer wanting to EVER GO THERE! Even the manager that used to talk to me only talks to certain people! What an unprofessional way to try and run a business!This restaurant in Ocotillo area  appears to be very poorly managed.  Just moved in to this area and have given this location several visits.
The employees can't smile, takes them forever to greet at the speaker,I received the wrong salad - called them from home - mgr said come back mention my name and we will replace the salad for you.  i went back the following evening and they flat out refused  to do anything- sorry we don't if this happened or not- the mgr is off today. Unbelievable!!!very poor training and employees don't care-most likely the mgr doesn't care either.Tried to have a nice dinner here on a Saturday night, 7:30-ish. Usually have a good experience here for a weekday lunch and knew my son and his fiancé would like it. However, tonight we had to walk out. No one came to take our order. Even after we politely asked the busboy to ask someone to take our order. It's not like they were busy - pretty empty actually. Just got tiered of waiting and watching the staff walk around setting tables and ignoring us. And as we left, there were two waitpersons just leaning against the wall chatting behind the hostess station. Plenty of other choices in North Scottsdale where you won't be so rudely ignored.I think I actually 'hate' this place. Strong words. It started many many years ago when my dad had me pick up an order here for carry-out. They forgot to make half the order and when I came back to get it - they didn't apologize for over-charging me, about forgetting the order or seem to notice I drove back to get it. I sat waiting for the order for. ever. 

Forgetting to include food in a take-out order happens, it's a simple mistake, I get it. But they didn't respond appropriately, in any way at all, just kind of stood there like "soooo does this mean you want us to make it now...err...maybe?...well....hmmm.." My dad actually called the manager when I got back - the second time - and he didn't offer an apology or remedy the situation. 

The food is just awful. I save the word "mediocre" for frozen wings, pizza & subs from the freezer section - Uncle Sam's is not worthy, it's gross. 

If my review isn't enough to warn you to dine elsewhere, maybe the state's health inspection review is - 

How bad is a restaurant that actually needs the government to tell them to get rid of roaches?

"OBSERVED TWO LIVE ROACHES PRESENT UNDER EQUIPMENT IN BAR. HAVE LICENSED PEST CONTROL PERFORMED UNTIL PESTS ARE ELIMINATED."Okay, I call Verizon 800# to check out WHERE the closest store was when I was out and about. I was directed to this store. So here, I go. Guys are wearing Verizon Shirts, so I think, I am in a Verizon store... NOT! IT's a retailer...BUT that is not the kicker. I walk in, they don't have a ph that I need, but will go pick one up. Nice Customer Service, I think... Well, I pay for my ph; they hook up the ph #, and I walk out. No problem...right? WRONG! I go home and start using my ph..go into the pictures and WTH?!!! There is a pix of a fat woman on my NEW phone that I paid FULL price for... So I figure, it's a refurbished phone GO WIRELESS SOLD TO ME AS BRAND NEW-- Nice work guys. BUT wait, it gets worse! I then take the ph back to an actual Verizon store an THEY tell me, that I have to take it back to the store-Go Wireless, that I bought it from. I drive all the way back out and THEN, return everything, cancel my contract, my ph #, etc... -it's been less than 3 days; and want a credit. Not to mention the time I wasted...Thinking I had it all figured out, it's canceled, right? I go to A REAL Verizon store and asked get a new ph- only to find out Go Wireless NEVER canceled my old number/contract. WTF?!! Geezus, and am told I need to call the Go Wireless Store to have them cancel it... I call the Store again..and they give me the 800 # for Verizon. Lucky, I called because Verizon was going to charge me the $350 for early term fee-- THAT Go Wireless never took care of in the first place.... Geezus guys!  Is this brain surgery because everyone acts like it is. It's a one banana job. My suggestion is--NEVER EVER USE THEM. Now, it will be interesting to see if I ever get a refund from these clowns...Tanya W, I wished so bad that I had read your review before I, myself became involved with these clowns.  They completely ruined what's supposed to be one of the most fondest memories of your life. 

    My experience with them: I found a dress that I liked, not loved. When I found it I was all alone, so I had the opinions of the BC staff coercing me into thinking this is the best dress and the best deal I will ever find. I felt very torn about the dress, but time is running out before my wedding date, and I felt I needed to come to a decision sooner than later. So I wrote them a check for 1600. (a steal according to them) and left, no sooner than I had started my car to go home, I was having second thoughts, and by the time my 15 minute car ride was over and I was opening my front door that I thought "Oh my god I don't want that dress!" So I called and told them of my second thoughts and told them I was coming back. 15 minutes later, I was back in their store, arguing with John, the President of the store. He told me that I was just having bridal nervousness and that this was normal. He also said that I probably left his store to go to another store and found another dress there and that he didn't believe me. He also said he had already gone to the bank in the last 15 minutes so there is nothing he could do. After this drawn out argument I told him that after he was so unwilling to help his customer, having been called a liar, and that I "liked the dress, you're just nervous" I told him that he was making me incredibly uncomfortable and that I didn't want to do business with people who operated like this. I told him I was going to cancel my check and that there was nothing I could do about that. *zing. 

Long story short, Jerry called me that night and told me that i was under contract with them and that I had to get a dress with them, whether it was that one or another one. I said when I come back I don't ever want to see John again and that she really needs to re-evaluate the way they treat their customers. 

Needless to say when I went to pick up my dress yesterday,everything was in boxes and disarray.  I found out they are "moving." (read as going out of business i bet, considering they have no place to move to yet.) That's what happens when you run a petty, money pinching, unprofessional business that they did, and I don't feel bad at all. I got my dress and I am washing my hands of these fools forever."No Vegans Allowed", reads a sign posted just above the entrance and narrated by a middle aged man in slow motion usually working for charlie brown. Okay, maybe not, but it should be there. The only thing truly vegan on the menu is the guacamole, so they claim. The pastas all have cheese, even just red sauce pasta (they cook the cheese into the sauce), my sources reveal. The only reason I find myself at Oregano's is if one of my friends is getting a melted chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on it, which, to be honest, looks delicious.I have always been a huge fan of Rays and recommended the establishment to others looking for close to authentic NY pizza  but my experience with them on March 3, Sunday, has changed my mind. We called about 15min before they closed (kind of a dick move, but they were "technically" still open). Service was fine. We ordered a medium white pizza and a plain calzone. When we brought it home (a 5min drive) it was cold. No biggie though, just stuck it in the oven for a couple minutes. Once we took a bite into it though.... UGH!!! The  dough was so tough it seemed that it had been sitting out for hours. I get it that we were probably one of the last orders of the night but this was worse than cafeteria pizza that had been sitting out through 3 lunch periods. Its unfortunate that this happened at one of my favorite spots, but I wont be returning. Head to POMO if youre in the North Scottsdale area. MUCH better and MUCH more fresh pizza!My experience could not have been more negative.  The doctor's medical protocol made me very sick.  She admitted to several errors but did not correct them then would not correct them when brought to her attention twice.  Her staff did/does not return phone calls.  There are too many doctors in the valley to put your health in the hands of this doctor and her staff.the reviews are accurate.  This place is physically quite attractive, and new, with a pretty pool and outside area, but the staff is BAD HORRIBLE unprofessional.
The housekeeping threw out a whole bag of my medication, didn't even look to see what was in it.  I told the desk.  They claim they had a whole crew in looking "All night" and didn't find it.  In the morning I went to the trash and there it was right on the top.
Another time I arrived just before midnight with my boyfriend.  They gave me the key to a room where a man was sleeping.  They then said they were full.  It was a nightmare. the guy at the desk basically threw us out.
I know now what they say about a book and it's cover.  That is why I ALWAYS go to the country inn next door, a family hotel with good values and a staff that cares.
Like a good wine, it gets better with age.Arizona Mills is what happens when Mesa and Peoria* have babies. That's all I'll say, as it's all been said already.

*Mesazonans and Peorians, I'm sorry, but some of your ilk has driven me to disrespect. If you're yelping and awesome, then you are exempt from this idiom.So I love burritos and will try one at just about any Mexican fast food place. I know what to expect when I eat at those places and know what to expect from Filibertos but this Filibertos should be closed down.It was horrible and nearly inedible. I really love food and usually can deal with some bad stuff but this was just disgusting. The tortilla was overcooked as well as everything else inside. The meat was horrible and very low quality. Be sure to avoid this location at all costs. Could not finish my food and it gave me a sour stomach throughout the night into the morning.Came to this store to buy some groceries. Used the self checkout line. Clerk asked for my ID and continued with the sale. The machine malfunctioned and the associate had to help. This managing staff must be retarded. After 20 minutes of trying to help me they could not refund the money to my gift cards for at least 24 hours. Staff is uneducated and flat out rude.  I would not recommend coming to this store. There are many more reputable businesses in the area that have cheaper prices.Been here a couple times. The quality of the food seems to be going down, fast. The service is ok, but definitely not great. The wait for food in the drive through is pretty bad, for fast food drive thru. Won't be going here very often. Too bad, cause I used to like their breakfast.My friend, boyfriend and I decided to go for Ladies Night + Karaoke. Boyfriend was our designated driver for the evening, so why the hell not? You can't beat $2.50 drinks  (which were awesome . . . one thing this place got RIGHT!) and drunk singing with your girls. We THOUGHT it would be a good time . . . 

So many things wrong with this place. It's as DIVE-y as it gets! But hey, like Vikram A. said . . . just look at the area. 

The "karaoke regulars" were screaming all kinds of stuff at my friend and I like, "OH EM GEEEEEEEEEEEEE I sing it better, bitch!" or that we sucked. Classy . . . because your rendition of Katy Perry's "E.T" or whatever it's called was American Idol material  *eyeroll* 

IT'S  KARAOKE, DON'T TAKE YOURSELF SO DAMN SERIOUSLY! But since we're playing that game: You suck at singing yourself. You're just a cheap knock-off of Katy Perry . . . I'll check you at the factory outlet, sweetheart. ;) 

The bathrooms felt and looked like a scene out of Zombieland. When I walked into the stall I was waiting for someone/something to come under the door and stab me.

Also, our waitress (wish I remembered her name, the one with her bra hanging out) was pretty much screwing around the entire night with her friends. When she got off work, she tabbed us out (without us asking) and said, "I have to leave now, but you can keep drinking 'til 2AM!" Then proceeded to go drink and screw around with her friends more, just like she did while on the clock. 

I think that ^ was the nail in the coffin. When you can't "delight" your customers in the service industry, expect them to vote with their feet. 

If you're looking for an AWESOME Karaoke experience, try Darkhorse on Ray and Rural in Chandler. Great karaoke selection, friendlier clientele / staff, and less trashy for sure.Just like several of the other posters here, I went to Meridian because it was cheap and close. My husband dropped off his suit and a bridesmaid dress of mine together, and when he went to go pick it up, they said they couldn't find my dress and they'd give us a call regarding this. Fast forward to 6 months later: I realize I still don't have the dress back, so I swing by the shop to pick it up (assuming that after 6 months it would be there). I ask for the dress via looking up my husband's phone number, giving him the background that it has been several months since I dropped it off. He goes to "look" for it in the rack directly behind him.. less than two steps away... clearly recent articles of clothing and says that its not there. I ask him if its not there, where is it? He says its probably at my house already picked up. I step back and think.. maybe my husband picked it up for me. So I say good-bye and I call my husband. He tells me that he never picked up the dress either. At this point I'm livid because I'm convinced that they have lost this $120 dress. I go home, find the receipt off my husband's suit (luckily it was still on there, otherwise I'd be screwed), and bring both the suit and the receipt in to the same guy. I explain the situation once again. ALL OF A SUDDEN there is a place in back that has items that were "held". WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE LOOKED THERE IN THE FIRST TRIP GIVEN THE SITUATION'S BACKGROUND??? My opinion was laziness. Or its just a shady company. He tried to say that they called my husband, but if they did, they did not leave a message, which is useless. Moral of the story: DON'T TRUST THEM NOT TO LOOSE VALUABLE ITEMS AND NEVER GET BACK TO YOU.This place has a hefty grey haired man with quite the crappy attitude.With his Horrible customer service skills, it's no wonder he's stuck working in this tiny gun shop crammed in the corner of the tiniest strip mall. Just went in on a whim, to ask a question about a particular rifle, and he acted like a complete DICK. I felt very uninvited in the store, and wouldn't spend a dime in this place nor 10 seconds of my time.I have used Purcells a few times, its close and convenient. I'm done after the most recent experience. I took my vehicle there for new tires and then took it back at replacement time. They put new tires on and I left for a weekend get away. Great, flat tire! A little shop in Pine fixed my tire, the valve stem was leaking. All the valve stem seals were old and dry rotted, something Purcells should have done with the new tires.  I called them and they said they don't replace them, that's extra. So, I took it to Community Tire at 51st and Cactus and they replaced them all for me and also showed me that Purcells damaged the bead on the tire when they put them on. Back to Purcells where they tell my son they always replace the valve stems..... Ok. Which is it?

So, I'm done with Purcells. Community Tire treats me great, are honest and try to save me money and keep me safe. As a woman getting her vehicle serviced, it's important to me to feel that I'm being treated fairly with honest advice from the professionals.The most rude, unprofessional staff i ever encountered. The products from this company are made cheaply & they do not stand behind their product. My hubby bought a pair of expensive glasses because this is the only place his insurance covered. Within 4 months, the frames were chipping, the glass from 1 of the lenses even chipped. He NEVER dropped them, although this establishment accused him of doing just that. EVEN THE LAB AT THEIR HEADQUARTERS!! Will never go into another store again. I suggest you do the same.If i can avoid this location i will, I have never walked in Arrowhead Ulta without wanting to shoot myself in the foot. To find an employee with like finding a needle in a hay stack. The manager alone is one of the unfriendliest of them all. Every encounter I've had with her she is either short and snooty, rolling her eyes at a customer or annoyed she's even there. Sometimes i feel like her red hair could actually light itself on fire..  You could find better and happier customer service in a gas station. The line is never manageable... Usually wraps around the store and never is caught up to a decent size.... Though the store is kept tidy the constant hassle of trying to find an employee and the 20 minutes just to purchase items ruins it for me.. Ulta at Happy Valley Town Center is just as tidy, the employees engage with customers and the line is maybe a 2 minute wait at the business.This place is over priced and not very good. Why would you pay those prices for pretentious Mexican food? Filburto's is better tasting and better priced. The decor is nice, but I prefer good food.Went here for a birthday dinner. Place was busy as it was dinner rush, heard the sound of plates crashing and server came around corner with two of our plates dropped one, pasta was hanging off edge of mine, my jaw almost dropped when server used his hand to flip my pasta back on my plate and placed it in front of me. Yum yum. Ate here another time as I was taking a bite of my ckn parmesan server stopped by to check on us. I fished out a 3 inch strand of hair out of the mouthful I had right in front of her ? Go to Tony Roma's or any place else.I am so upset and disappointed with Chipotle across from Sunset Station on Sunset Road. At 1:45pm 6/24/12, a husky latino young man, gave me the WORST service ever! I ordered a bowl with vegetables and steak, of which they apparently were running out. I get a significantly smaller portion than what I usually get at your restaurant. When I asked for more veggies to supplement the lack of both steak and veggies, the attendant said we are out; I said I would wait; he throws the plate away with an attitude and a dirty look, with no intention of giving me what I asked for. I had to spend my money at Spicy Pickle to get the food and service I deserveUnder the "NEW AND IMPROVED" management the newly "reopened" Santora's has managed to go down to a C grade (which they kept hidden behind a curtain)!  They still allow smoking while people are eating.....which is against the law!!  And they were featured in DIRTY DINING on channel 13 for having nasty, moldy, slimy, icky food.  Looks like the "NEW AND IMPROVED" management is really working out for you!  

http://www.ktnv.com/news/local/175661241.htmlAfter a long day I decided to meet a friend at a casual establishment and since I recently opened a business in the neighborhood I thought it would be nice to meet our neighbors.   I never give bad reviews.... but this place does NOT want your business.  

After being warned about our casual conversational speaking level, we kept quiet and proceeded to sit in the corner and speak at low levels about daily events and politics.  We were asked again to keep our conversation to a minimal.

Apparently you cannot speak in this bar because it disrupts patrons.   

This bar is a funeral procession.   I have never been treated so rudely for spending money.  

Unless you are on your way to your death bed and hate noise or any conversation--- leave this place out.! 

People go here to die.I took my car into the dealership to get the first oil change (new FR-S I bought in February). I also mentioned that the air pressure light would randomly come on but it was no longer on and the tire pressure was fine in all of the tires. The service staff member carefully looked at all of the tires and also stated they look fine, no noticeable issues with pressure, and he did not see any nails. He said they would change the oil and look at the tire pressure light issue.

About 45 minutes later he approached me in the waiting area stating that there was a nail in my tire and that they took it out and tried to fix it but then they realized it was a little close to the wall of the tire and they could not repair it so I needed to purchase a new tire. Then he handed me an invoice for almost $300 for one new tire. 

I explained to him that I did not authorize anyone to take the nail out of the tire and asked him why they would do that without first consulting me? I did not authorize such work in the service agreement I signed. I have never had a situation where a service shop would do something like that without my consent. I explained to him that Findlay's actions were not authorized and that I am now being forced to purchase a new tire which sounds a little like a scam to me. His response was that if I didn't purchase a new tire they could put the spare on for me and send on my way. I asked if the spare was a true spare or a donut and he said he would go check.

About 30 minutes later he came back and guess what.....all of a sudden the story changed. Seems the service guy did NOT take the nail out after all and he is just going to pump the tire up and put it back on the car. Without even getting into how much of a SCAM this is, I told him the tire was not flat, or even low, when I brought it in so I don't understand why the guy had to "pump it up". He had no answer for me.  

I fully believe this was a scam to lead me to believe that I HAD to buy a new tire. Had I not questioned the actions of the service and blindly took them at their word that the nail was removed, they tried to fix it but after it was out they couldn't, I would have been forced to spend $300 on a new tire for THEIR unauthorized work. To further my belief that this I a total scam, only after I refused to blindly pay $300 and questioned their actions did it come out that in fact they had NOT done the work they originally claimed to have done.

I don't know if it was because I was a single female and they thought they had a sucker on the line, or if this is status quo for Findlay but either way it is so wrong.

I got my car and I left.  At that moment they lost me as customer and forever lost my recommendation.Started the adventure around a year ago. Food and service so bad my husband complained and received a comp. We didn't want to go back there, so we redeemed it at their sister property, Silver Nugget . Tried again @ Opera House 2 wks ago, hubby was reeled in by 16oz t-bone for $5.99. Bad decision. Steak coated in pepper. Returned that and hard as nail potato. Results in another comp, $15 this time. Entire time , mgmt horrified their staff is that horrible. We take my father, probably for amusement value @ this point. Green beans are not seasoned, at all. We ask for them to be sent back, seasoned. Waitress brings back, in same bowl , with pepper liberally shaken on. I know this is a ghetto- fabulous casino, but pepper on everything ? We inform the manager, whom has  a pow wow w kitchen staff . They smugly
 inform us we are no longer welcome. As if...I invite the manager to sample the green beans. She declines , stating she, the 90 lb skinny broad is not picky about her food. It's obvious the food that goes down her gullet passes stringent tests, unlike the employees she hires or the food they serve. Better off  as a snack bar.I just left here disappointed in their customer service, or lack thereof. I walked in the door and all 3 stylist were with clients. No problem. I sat down to wait.  Within minutes one of the stylists was done. She smiled at me and said hi but that was it. Another stylist walked in off her break I presumed. I watched her get her station ready. Then both stylist just wondered around the room chatting to each other. I was never helped. Never asked if i needed anything. After waiting for 15 minutes i got up and left. No one even noticed.I loved this place because I had amazing health insurance at the time so I happily paid $400 for 2 pairs of glasses which would have cost us $1500 out of pocket. I liked their frame selection because they carry Gucci, Dior, & Oliver People's but they are TERRIBLE at doing lenses. If you have bad eyesight and actually need glasses to do their job, do not come here. 

My husband and I both got the poly-carbonate lenses with anti-glare and I was so disappointed by the quality. I needed my glasses adjusted when I got them (as everybody does) and the crappy lab that these people send their glasses to put on a cheap layer of anti-glare so that when they're adjusted, they literally melt and smear!!! Who does that!? I've been wearing glasses for 10 years now and have never had to deal with something so ridiculous. 

After my first fitting and my lenses got smeared, they sent them back and received the second pair a week and a half later. Those got smeared during the adjustment process too. Those were sent back and on my 3rd pair, the people realized that they'll have to put a cloth over the lenses to not get them too hot so they won't smear. What a hassel! This place is so far from my house and every time I need adjustments, I have to come back here in hopes that my lenses won't smudge and I'll be screwed out of glasses. I've had those glasses since last February and about 6 months in, the anti-glare began rubbing off at the bottom and continued to do so until my frames snapped two nights ago. 

My husband's anti-glare actually got smudged because he left his glasses out in the car one day and then tried to clean them. This place offers a one year warranty on their lenses so they replaced them for free, but it was still an incredible inconvenience. I will never recommend anybody nor return here again. My father-in-law also purchased a pair of glasses here and had the same problem of the anti-glare wearing after a couple of months. So cheap. Go across the street to Lenscrafters where you pay a little more but you only have to wait one hour instead of 1 month to get a pair of working glasses.If there was no star rating I would give it.  I brought a keyblade over to these guys to get cut.   After giving me a (rude) speech about how he is probably the only person in town that would do that type of work and how he wouldnt garantee it, he proceeded to charge me $5 (A SIDE) for a two sided key.  

I should have probably inspected the work but I had my 2 year old with me so I left after paying the $10 dollars.  Once I got home I tried the key, and of course it didnt work.  I shouldnt have even bothered, once you compared both keys it was PAINFULLY obvious that the cut was all messed up.  Figured as much given it took him about 2 mins to cut the key.

Long story short I ordered another key blade and took it to MX Locksmiths.  They charged me $1.08 to cut it and oddly enough, it works.....Bf wanted to check this place out, since we were only in town for a night.  I went here before when I was 21...that's like 5-6 years ago.  It was better service back then.  I will never come back here again. lol

The hotel was really dirty and old!  It's different for sure and nice to come check it out, but to stay no thank you!  So spoiled from The Wynn, Cosmo, and Vdara....  Where to start.... When we first got into the room, the lights wouldn't turn on.  We put the room key into the key slot that's required for the energy to turn on.  For some reason the light switch wouldn't work, you have to press the button like 5-6 times!  The bathroom look is the WORST!  It wouldn't even turn on after soo soooo many times!  And the worst of this is that, finally you would get it to turn on, it would turn off in a second!  It's like.. WTH?!?  The couch's foot is broken...You can see from the metal foot all the screws are hanging out.  -_-!  Ok now...this is the worst part...the bed sheets and blankets were sooooo GROSS!  You can remove the sheets and see stains and hair ALL OVER THE BEDDING!  We just removed all the bedding stuff and used the blanket in the closet...boy, that has hair and stains all over it too.  Stains were yellow, gray and black!  o.O

If you're gonna want to sleep in a quiet hotel, this isn't the spot.  We got back to the hotel around 5:20am and people were still getting to the hotel and people were still raging it like crazy in the lobby and the lounge.  Also in our room 415, I think the hotel outside speaker was right outside of our room, you can hear music blasting at 10 am.  It's so loud that we can even shazam the dang song! As it gets later the music gets louder!  

The house keeping was the worst!  Worst Service ever of this place, obviously! But at 11am, they literally bang on your room and tell you have to check out now.  She did it 3 times really loud.  "Excuse you, lady!  We called for a late check out until 3pm and we're paying extra for it".  She even asked us, "Are you sure, you have late check out?"   "Dude, what do you mean are we sure?  Isn't it your job to know?"  TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE SERVICE!

I guessed when I was younger, I never remember staying at any hotels and it was like this.  It's the worst hotel experience ever!

Let's stick to our usual hotels now, booboo!  =DThis was my regular grocery store for 2 1/2 years. It was the only grocery store in the neighborhood. You could walk in easily find a cart, they have wide aisles and plenty of selection. However the meats are poorly cut-a rookie or inexperienced butcher I presume. Of course the prices were a little cheaper than Vons,Smiths or Wal-mart BUT now they have remodeled and the prices are no longer LESS, there are tons of people every time you go and long lines, broken carts and the produce is lackluster at best. Lots of little Mexican kids running unattended throughout the store and when you finally go to get out of there there's usually 1 or if your lucky 2 cashiers. The belts are always dirty & sticky and you have to bag your own shit while a mentally challenged employee stands by and stares into space. Never any help bagging and definitely nobody to assist you to the car which explains why you never see elderly people here. On one occasion I saw a homeless lady walking through the store and when we were in the parking lot 2 employees came out after her and tackled her to the ground claiming she had shoplifted-very unprofessional. 
If you like rubbing elbows with illegals and bums to wait forever to buy overpriced below average quality stuff-this is probably your store of choice.I used to eat pho so 1 with my family when we're in Vegas. Their pho is NOT good at all!!! We stop going their for years., then we found other pho place like Kim Long or pho Saigon 8 which right down the street. We went back to pho so 1 this passed Saturday to try again with my friends. I must say it was a HUGE MISTAKES!!!!! The services was horrible and the foods was NOT good! Myself, my husband & my son came in last and I order bun bo hue, it was ok and my husband & son order pho. It took them at least 30 minutes or more. After we waited for 20 minutes, I went to the cashier, which I think she's the owner. I ask her about my 2 bowl of pho. I brushed my off in a very rude way & she said "u need to wait cuz there's 20 bowl of pho togo ahead of u"!!! By then I was mad but I didn't want to say anything. So I went back to my table and patiently wait until another 10 more minutes. By then my husband was really upset! He got up & went back to the counter and talk to one of the guy which we also think he's the owners son, cuz he did not wear his uniform. He's not a tall guy, kinda chubby and of course not good looking at all but he sure act like he's all that! Anyways, my husband ask him about the 2 bowl of pho. He told my husband in a very rude way again, " we have 20 bowl of pho togo &  u have to wait!!". My husband was so upset then said, u can't make 2 bowl of pho for us & let the 20 bowl wait.  It only take 3 minutes to make 2 bowl of pho. We should know cuz we're pho's owner's ourselves! They rather let their dine-in customers to wait & loose them for good or just push the togo wait for 2-3 minutes & makes their customer's happy! I guess they don't need customers cuz they think that they have so much that if they loose us know cares! To build customers takes a long time. But to LOOSE customers, not  long at all! Anyways, we still have to wait for out pho for another 10 more minutes until we get to eat our pho. By the time they bring out the pho. I over heard them say that they have parties for 20. So they started to clean up our table just to get the other parties in. By then I was upset becuz they took a long time for the pho, then finally came out, they rushed us, that's really bad. We will never go back & I will let everyone that I know. Who ever read this, please don't go to pho so 1 cuz they will treats their customers like SH-T!They should move the Oyster Bar in here!Bottom Line, Not impressed. We went for the inexpensive room and did not even get what we paid for. And our expectations were low!

We thought we were paying $45 a night and they charged an additional $17 resort fee PER NIGHT! This room was no better than a $30 motel 6 room which probably has a better view. Our view was a wall on the other side of an alley and it was the same alley as the recycling center. Imagine glass being poured into a metal container every few hours.  We could also hear the employees hanging out on their break. We were looking for a basic room to sleep and did not care about the amenities of the "resort". You can feel the springs in the beds.  Water randomly ran out of the shower head during the night making noise.  

Restaurants: Why would we want to eat  at a scary looking Chinese food cafeteria or coco's with so many other great restaurants in Vegas.  Sorry, this place is not worth more than $30 a night (after all fees) and it ended up costing over $60 a night after all of the fees. Go elsewhere.My aunt told me I had to come here. I'm from San Diego and sometimes I go to Vegas as often as once a month for a few days, but no fewer than 6 times a year. I eat out. A lot. When going to the restaurant, the most important things are: food, service, price...well...for me at least. This is the type of restaurant where you cook your own food. No problem! I enjoy that! But, when chefs in the kitchen don't need to cook your food for you, you would think the food would come out sooner, don't you???

They took our menus away before we could barely get a chance to look at it! Granted we went because of the buffet special $17.95 per person for all you can eat...but you have to order each meat plate you want...how do we know which to choose without a menu!?!? AH!

The spicy pork was OVERLY marinated. Chadogolgi or however you spell it (thin curls of beef) was the usual but the dipping sauce was not good. If you live in Southern California, wait till you get home to go to a decent Korean BBQ place (like Tahoe or Castle in LA)By far the worst bank I've ever banked with. How the HELL do you charge your own clients money to withdraw from your own atm??? Um...... they do!!!! It's normal for another atm to charge you a fee...... Well so does this bank. You not only get charged with the other bank or atm fee, but 1NCU also charges you a $3 fee for using another bank or atm. Really???? I can't stand the service. There bank has 2 tellers only, and the line could be full as 15-20 people and there isn't any additional help provided. The list goes on and on. I'm exhausted just thinking about the problems............. oh yeah, they also charge you $19.50 a month just to have a checking account. HaHahaha. I love this free world............ Not!!!!!! One Nevada Credit Union is garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bank of America or Wells Fargo here I come.This place was really gross. To bad there wasn't a zero star. I got the Bobbie because I thought it was creative but it was disgusting. I pulled out a piece of hair and I got a soda. The total was like 15 bucks. It sucks. No recommendationThe Salvation Army discriminates against people who aren't like them.  Did you know they spent $10 million dollars to try and prevent their organization from having to following anti-discrimination laws in hiring?They might as well sell adult toys, that way when they screw you, at least it makes sense.

Most unknowledgeable staff ever to work a camera store.  (What's a neutral density filter?)  Upon understanding what I was looking for they offered a Tiffen 3 step for $149; not even in the realm of reasonable. 

Also in need of a stepping ring, I asked for a 72mm - 77mm.  Was sold the inverse.  The return attempt (next day) was an exercise in futility.  All sales final.  For a $15 purchase.  I can completely understand a reasonable return policy for purchases of significant equipment to avoid 'rental' attempts, but $15?

I'm still sore.Terrible - don't bother

I drove out to visit this place based on the good reviews on Urban Spoon. I was harassed by 2 separate guys while getting out of my car - asking for money. I felt very unsafe here. It was 1pm on a Monday! I looked in and noticed that the actual drugstore had closed and the building was empty. Tiffany's was still open though. I went inside and found one customer sitting at the counter and another standing waiting for a take out order. There was a man cooking at the grill and a woman behind the counter. As I walked in, the woman behind the counter looked at me then turned around and faced the grill man. She stood there staring at him while he was cooking for over 3 minutes and completely ignored me as I was standing at the counter. I said, "excuse me" and was ignored still. After looking at the cleanliness of this place (which was quite disgusting) and after being rudely ignored purposely, I decided to leave and never come back! I was astonished at how rude the woman was. If they have good food, I will never know as the service is deplorable and not worth the time. What a shame.You still get one star, you douche-bags. 

Called and left a message with their fraud department which was amazingly returned within two days, and they told me that they sent me a letter closing my identity theft claim. *click* And they sent it to my old address so I had to run down there to get the letter. I am going to write out this entire letter for you so you can see how they deal with issues like this, with some commentary in parentheses: 

Adina M.,
We are in receipt of the identity theft claim documentation and very much appreciate your time and effort in providing it to our office. After conducting a thorough investigation (LOL one week is THOROUGH?!) we have approved your identity theft claim. 

Therefore, we have contacted our collection agency and provided them determination. The collection agency was instructed to clear and remove this as being placed in error and to notify the credit bureaus of this immediately. 

Though the collection agency will report this information to the three credit bureaus today, the actual removal of this collection can up to 30 days (did they forget the word "take"?) depending on the date each bureau updates their database. All credit checks/inquiries through Equifax requested by COX Las Vegas will be removed within the same time frame. 

We apologize for the inconvenience (understatement of the century!!!) and appreciate your help in identifying and removing this fraudulent account. (REALLY?!! It isn't like YOU were any freakin' help OPENING the account in the first place under the wrong name and address! And I only identified it because I NEEDED SERVICE! If I never called your damn company I would have never known since it did not actually show up on my credit report!!!!) 

Sincerely, 
Fraud Department (at a different address than what they put on the credit packet. Nice.)


So yeah, that's the letter. Did they offer me service? No. At the very least I should have been reimbursed for my time, gas money, faxes, and certified letters. This whole debacle cost me over $50 to fix, and they offer me nothing, just thank me in a "we fucked up, whoops" letter. Even if they did offer me service, I wouldn't take it even if they were the only providers in Vegas. I seriously hope this monopoly they are running falls to the ground and I hope that maybe this review will pressure others to call Cox even if they have service with another company just to check if they may have been victims of identity theft. And MAYBE this will spark them to actually hire more people for the fraud department or have more information online since this incident had me running around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to fix it, but I seriously doubt it will since they only care about getting money no matter if it is in bad conscience or not. Fuck you very, very much for putting me and possibly hundreds of other Las Vegans in this shitty mess that should not have happened to begin with.

Oh P.S. Thank you for giving me the address used for this account. If I was a lesser person I would visit this residence with a crow bar but instead I am just going to pass it on to the police like a good citizen would so these fuckers can be taken down. I only wish you would go with them. Ta-ta!It's the policy of the restaurant to put the wet naps on the plate with the food 
That wet nap was in storage after storage where rats piss on the box and then it's put on the plate along with the food disgustingMy grandson goes to this daycare center and I cannot tell you how disappointed I am. This place is unclean, smells and the staff should all go for training.  The worst part is how they handle their financials.  One week they do it one way and then they change without notifying the client.  The lock accounts down and the parents are continuously trying to figure out the problem.  The owners need to pay special attention to this situation and hope that the health department does not become involved.  The front desk has supervisor who is clueless as to the operations of this center.  She is rude and has no answers to questioned put to her about the billing situation.  I am currently looking for another  24 hour day care center.We've actually stayed at this hotel on 2 previous visits and had nice stays, however our most recent stay(April 26th and 27th) was just plain awful.  We arrived early on Friday at about noon and Justin was working the front desk.  We did not request to check-in early, but we did request a top-floor room as we did when we made our reservation.   Foot traffic noise in this hotel is exceptionally bad.  Every person's footstep sounds like a loud bass drum, so if you're a light sleeper, you need to be on the top floor or you're going to have a long, miserable night.  So when we politely asked Jason about a room on the top floor, he said, "Sure, I can get you one of those"  He wrote down our names on a scrap sheet of paper and told us he'd call us when the room was ready.  By 3:30pm we had not received a call so we decided to head back to the hotel.  When we tried to check-in with Justin, he said, "Okay, I've got you in a room on the 2nd floor."   We asked why he put us there when we specifically requested the top floor 3.5 hours ago.   He said, "Sorry, I'll put you back on the list".   So we had to continue to wait.  When we came back about 6pm, a different person was working the front desk.  She said, "Sorry we won't have any rooms on the top floor tonight.  I don't know what Justin told you, but they're simply not available now".  So they basically gave those rooms to someone else.  Here's where it gets really bad.  This woman apologized for the situation and said, "Here, I'm going to block off a top-floor room for you tomorrow night so you'll be guaranteed a top-floor room tomorrow."  We said "thank you" and managed to sleep on and off despite the fact that she placed in a room that bordered the stairwell and we got to hear people running up and down the stairs all night, and we got to stand in 5 inches of water in the shower since it didn't drain.   Now, the next day, we try to check-in early and Justin says, "Your room should be available in a few minutes".   So we waited there at the hotel for 90 minutes just to watch Justin walk out the door for the day and the new woman promptly tell us that there won't be any rooms available for another 2 hours.  I verified with her that she still had that room blocked off for us and she said "yes".   So we headed out and when we later returned that evening to our "guaranteed" top-floor room, and the new guy at the front desk says, "Sorry, I see that she blocked off a top-floor room for you, but for some 'unknown' reason, I don't have one for you".  Someone at the front desk that afternoon/evening basically unblocked it and gave it to someone else.   So the front desk staff there basically lies to your face, kicks the ball down the road or points their finger at the previous shift, and steals rooms from each other,   Also, despite leaving a tip for housekeeping on our first night's stay, they decided to keep my iPhone charger instead of turning it in to the front desk.  So they're a pack of thieves who steal even when you are nice enough to leave a tip.  Overall, a horrible stay at this Holiday Express which is unfortunate because we've had 2 nice stays in the past which led us to stay again on our recent trip.  We will absolutely never be back.Left me waiting, no show! I called after over 30 minutes and they said no one is in the area or on the way! Not even a phone call to give me a heads up, could've been waiting there and missed my flight!I had a crazy acne flare up a few years ago.  I researched derms and found a lot of good reviews about Dr. Aspacio.

When he came in to the exam room, he seemed rushed and acted like I was taking up his time by telling him my dermatological history.  I told him that I had tried a certain medication for my acne, but didn't like it because it made my skin raw and peely, and asked if he could make a suggestion for another solution.  So what does he prescribe?  That same medicine I had just told him I didn't want to use again.

Did you not hear what I said 10 seconds ago?  I just said it made my skin RAW!!  When I told him this again, he responded, "Well, you must be applying too much.  It's the gentlest medication there is, so there's nothing else I can give you."  He wrote the prescription and walked out.  I felt so uncomfortable at his chiding and found him to be one of the rudest doctors I've ever experienced.  No one should feel that way when it comes to a professional taking care of your body.  Everyone deserves much more than that.

I took his prescription, threw it out, and found another dermatologist who actually listened to my concerns and cleared my acne with another medication that didn't leave me looking like my face was coming off.Why do people think they can just make teriyaki? Samarai Sam's is definitely a great white hope to asian goodness. Ok so here's a teriyaki lesson:
Japanese make teriyaki usually with shaved beef or chicken pieces. and a light sauce. Usually from soy sauce, sugar, and sake...usually a thin sauce
Hawaiians: grill meat so it's got the charring and add a sweet sauce with a base of shoyu and brown sugar, pineapple juice/honey so it's sweeter.
Samarai Sam's: What the hell is a teriyaki wrap with rice? Doesn't it defeat the purpose of Atkins? Is this fusion? It's basically cheap, fast faux teriyaki bowls. For what it is....it's the McDonald's of Teriyaki. Is it good? Eh It's boring....I usually write out some lengthy reviews...
Today is not that day. 

The food quality, quantity and price - horrendous.

Save your money...please go elsewhere for your teriyaki.A haiku for the buffet inside this smoke-infested retirement home disguised as a casino littered with gambling addicts: 


Save yourself the time

Explosive Diarrhea 

Combined with mudd-buttGood deeds? Great deals? I don't know...

I have a disability, EM (Erythromelalgia). Store manager, Ben Niebauer, rudely discriminated against me by requiring me leave the Savers located at 3121 N. Rancho Dr. in Las Vegas, NV. I had spent quite a bit of time & effort picking out cloths to try  on. He would not let me try them on. He threatened to call the police to have me removed, even though I explained my handi-capped condition & showed him a letter from my doctor. I said I would sign a letter relieving Savers of all responsibility for my safety. He continued to threaten to call the police, but he didn't. All he did was get louder & more aggressive. So I told him I would call the police. I went outside with my mother to wait for the police. When they arrived, the police were told he had left.
I have never encountered this kind of treatment for being disabled.

(For more info on EM: http://www.erythromelalgia.org/WhatisEM.aspx). 

Did I see good deeds or great deals? No, but I would have liked to.Worst customer experience!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!
We were told to meet in front of the El Cortez casino at 8:45. We were there at 8:30 when 9 rolled around and not one bus had drove by I called the company. The lady told me we missed the bus and we would have to take a cab to planet hollywood to make the tour. 
To make this short save your money this is a complete scam. 
Thankfully Groupon showed how a company should treat a customer and refunded the money.Do not go to this cleaner if you expect the service they promise you on the phone!  They almost ruined my wedding due to their incompetence!    

For our wedding my husband and I flew to Las Vegas.  I needed to get my wedding dress pressed (not cleaned, just pressed) and I called Master Cleaners the week before we were to leave.  I explained that we would be flying into Vegas on a Friday and I needed the dress pressed no later than 10am the next morning.  I gave them the dates we would need their services, which happened to be good Friday and that Sat., and they said no problem.  They promised they would be able to get the dressed pressed and ready by 5pm that same day.  We flew in and headed straight to Master Cleaners.  Once there we were told that their pressers were not available due to the holiday and would not be back til Monday.  Obviously Monday was not going to work for me since our wedding was the next day.  They absolutely refused to help us even though they had promised to do so just a week early.  Well after running around to two other cleaners that were also not accepting business for the holiday and running up a very high taxi meter we decided to go back to the hotel and try to press the dress ourselves.  Thankfully my husband to-be knew how to use an iron (I thought they were decorative doorstops).  We managed to press the dress fairly well.  Moral of the story: watch out for any promises Master Cleaners' gives you!Farm Basket? After eating here I thought I was headed towards a warm casket.

The fried chicken in the "family fried chicken dinner" I had was absolutely fried a day (or days) earlier and then thrown in the microwave. I've made the mistake of reheating leftover fried chicken in the microwave before and this was a reheat job. Never have I had such a thick, soggy coat of breading on a piece of fried chicken that slid off in a greasy mess in one wet disgusting piece. Thick and soggy...and tasteless! -And for comic relief, inside the meat was dry. Just the worst piece of fried chicken I ever had. I dare you to find an elementary school cafeteria that could produce worse. Even my girlfriend agreed, "wow, this is bad".

To elaborate on the rest of the meal...

The rolls were not fresh
The cole slaw was dry and tasteless
The fries were INSANELY over-salted

...and I've had better mashed potatoes lunchtime at a Chinese buffet.

I really hoped I could go far on yelp without tossing out a one-star rating (as I have a soft spot for business owners) but to be this out of touch with what you are handing out across the counter is ridiculous.

I might eat at a fried chicken joint twice a year, but with options such as Popeye's, KFC and Church's everywhere...how anyone can justify coming here is beyond me. 

I would love to dine with someone who gave this place 3 or more stars just to see how they could possibly feign a compliment on any level.Farm basket is a place I rarely visit but today after work I wanted chicken fingers and I am lazy and they have a drive thru lol. So I ordered the finger meal deal which is 4 chicken fingers, small fries, one sauce and a drink. Total with tax is like $8 something. 

I asked for the chicken to be well done. It was not. I got Ranch for my dipping sauce but added honey mustard and hot sauce as well (which btw they charge for) and they were all horrible. The ranch was super watery as well as the hot sauce and the honey mustard was this lumpy yellow goo. Gross. I don't plan on returning and if you haven't been there save yourself a trip and don't go.I'm drunk, I come here and order a hot and spicy ( sub The mannaise  with Mac sauce) and 2 breakfast burritos. Tell me why I didn't get any hot and spicy??? What the fudge???The food is a joke.  I can understand if you like the atmosphere, but let's all get serious about the food.Fancy Nails is probably the worst place I have ever been to get my nails done. The first time I went I just got a basic manicure and they did an ok job. The place is fairly clean and I left mostly satisfied. The second time I went in I got a shellac manicure and it has horrendous. I have honestly never paid to have my nails done and have the result end up so sloppy. The manicurist was not paying attention and messed up and had to take all the polish off and start over again twice! When she finally finished the result was a bubbled smudgy mess.  I would honestly never set foot in this nail salon again especially for the prices they charge.lack of identity, the Asian noodles don't look nor taste like it, the pastas are the same. Taste like cooked by bunch of students, taste very plain. just like cooking from school.My dining partners really wanted Olive Garden; as much as I protested, I lost out and begrudgingly went along for lunch.

Slowest service ever. An hour plus wait for our salads and soup. No drink refills. Food was cafeteria grade (sorry to insult cafeterias) at best.

Old and dated interior; chairs are stained and disgusting. Ick, ick, ick.

And, it's expensive and the service is attrocious. We left a miniscule tip, and in hindsight should've asked for our money back. There's not a nice way to put it; Olive Garden sucks. Why do people tolerate such a horrible place?!I hate the biggest toy store there is.
Gee wiz.
They do have good prices but it's the worst shopping experience and they sell sooo much CRAP. 
The staff I dealt with there (checkout person) however was very pleasant.
The only reason I have for posting this review is to encourage people to shop the small businesses on etsy and in your local area. It's worth the extra bit of money.
Buy less and buy better quality!From the waiting area they announced the plane would have NO WATER ON BOARD for a 2 hour flight.  Nothing potable (drinkable), yet the ship steward announced it as "no portaable water" until fellow crewman corrected that...ahem!

They saved a bit of money bu purchaisng older planes?The flight out was delayed, again, for maintenance issues.  
The flight back was cancelled for, you guessed it, maintenance issues.   (Makes you wondering if they ran out of duct tape at Wal-mart.). But here is the funny part.  The gate agent said over the intercom, before they cancelled, "the new time of departure is 4:15 (and hour later).   We are still looking for a plane."   So I am guessing that you are not firm on 4:15....  I feel sorry for the front line employees...hang in there!Slow service by an incompetent MANAGER , who has NO customer service skills What so ever ! They should rethink WHO they want representing the BAD EGG      The Manager , along with staff should take a look at the service standards and retrain themselves .You'll either love this place, or hate it.  I must say, this was the worst Chinese food I've had since eating at some place in Gallup, New Mexico back in 1994!  Actually that place was the absolute worst.    BUT, I'm sure there are some tasty dishes this place must have because they were very busy during Monday lunch.  

When you walk in this place, the first thing you'll notice is the smell of grease.  Then you look around, and the atmosphere is dark, drab, and plastic.  There is no ambiance.   Then while you are being attended to, you'll find the staff not very friendly, the none really want to be there.   And last, but not least, you'll wonder why you ordered the food you did.  

I got the egg foo young.  Now some of you are wondering, how can I criticize a Chinese restaurant, when I'm not even ordering real Chinese food!  All I can say is, you might be right.  But really, this dish is so easy to get right, that I'm amazed at how much they got it wrong!   The egg patties were drowning in a totally flavorless brown sauce.   Plus they were slightly burned to a crisp, so essentially you were eating deep fried charcoal in a tasteless gravy.   Oh, and you get a golf ball sized dish of mediocre rice too.  

Like I said, I've heard some people love this place.  I don't know why.  But I do have an idea why this place is still in business.  Location, location, location!  Yes, it is centrally located to the DUI Court and Grand Jury building right next door.   That means tons of new people walk past this establishment on a daily basis.   Then there is the towering monstrosities of Maricopa Country judicial pride just around the corner where hundreds of people work, plead, or visit for jury duty.  And where is the ONLY Chinese Restaurant within any walking distance?  You got it, Sing High!  

My advice, don't go here for the food.  And don't go here for the historical significance.   It's not worth it.   Save that craving for Chinese food for something better.  Heck, even Panda Express would do.Dynamite Paving is a Terrible Company! Do not do business with this company! They jack up contract prices by 50%. My advice stay as far away as you can from these rip-off artists!After all the positive reviews of this place, plus my partner recommending it, I thought I would stop in at 2:15p on a Tuesday.  20 minutes or so later nobody has so much as asked me what I needed.  I guess I'll just take my money and business somewhere else to buy myself a new bike.  It's a shame; I saw some floor models I liked too.Went in and got no help for about thirty minutes. Finally a salesman was free and I informed them I was sent over from another location including what I was looking for. I got three bike literally pointed at and offered no information about the bikes. When I asked about a fourth bike the salesman said "it's a nice bike" I literally talked myself into a bike that was double my budget and the sales guy completely dropped the ball. I will never shop there or recommend that shop to ANYONE. Go to the Scottsdale location and you will be very well taken care of.TERRIBLE PLACE!! HORRIBLE FOOD!!! Bell Rd & 23rd ave. They got our take out order wrong, then we found a nasty hair in the food. We called the manager to let him know and he was in complete denial and said he could not do anything about that on a take order. This place is not clean inside and is a complete rip off! Don't waste your time or money.We decided to try vitos the other nite based on reviews and word of mouth so i went to there web site to check out the menu i noticed they delivered and it was 15% off for first delivery....perfect , so i ordered on line with a  delivery time noted as we got close to the delivery time i called to let them know that there was a gate code to get in she said i will call the driver to let him know....perferct, so came the delivery time...plus 10 minutes........plus 10 more minutes.......plus 10 more minutes......so i called back to find out where the order was....she said   oh were sorry we thought it was for pick up....WHAT THE HELL so i can't tell you how the food is BECAUSE WE NEVER GOT ANY. ended up going else where. A return phone call from mngt or owner might have been nice.This place has a really nice atmosphere, several good Italian beers on tap and a wonderful wine selection.   

The problem is I have eaten here four times in two years. The two times I had seafood with the pasta I got sick. Like almost food poisoning sick. 

Normally I would not have gone back after the first time but my wife loves the atmosphere here. So after 6 months or so I would give in and give La Stalla another try. The seafood appetizer did not sit well with her this last time so we won't be going back again for another try in 6 months. 

This place is busy when the resort is full and not so busy other times so maybe we were just unlucky and got some old seafood.  The problem I had with the non-seafood dishes I tried is that they were just OK and you can get just OK Italian food in Chandler at several other places for 1/2 what this place charges.

We had excellent service 3 times and rude service once.I always here great stuff about this place.

The food and service totally suck.

The tortillas are pretty good and the scenery is great but seriously, a blind homeless guy could cook better.

Complete rip off, dont believe the hype.This place get negative stars! I had to pick one star but it doesn't even earn one. Awful! We arrived on a Sunday evening, there were 2 other tables seated. There was a gentleman who worked there standing by the bar and another employee standing there and neither greeted us. We stood there for a minute before I asked if we should sear ourselves. The answer was yes. 
We ordered a large salad for 3 to split with dressing on the side. Then we ordered 2 gluten free pizzas and asked if the 'classic lasagna' had cheese because it doesn't say on the menu. The waitress said there was. 
45 minutes later we get a small salad with dressing on. Waitress apologized and offered to bring another but it took so long we declined. 
30 minutes later our pizza came. One burnt the other was fine. A few minutes later the lasagna came without cheese. We never got refills and no one checked on us.  After awhile another waitress asked how our meal was and we spoke up and said, not great. She offered to get the owner. Well, watch out if you have a problem! We planned on just letting him know what happened and we were disappointed. He came to the table with his arms folded  (turns out he was the gentleman that was at the bar and didn't greet us either) asked what was wrong. We told him about the lasagna, the salad and before getting any farther he got defensive telling us his lasagna doesn't have cheese and if the waitress told us that, we shouldn't tip her. What kind boss tells you not to tip his employees???
We told him that's not what we wanted. He started getting defensive telling us it sounds like we do this all the time and HE never told us there wasn't cheese its our problem and kept telling us we don't have to tip the waitress and he's been open for 13 years of business and clearly he's been successful and it's us that was the problem.  I have never in my life experienced that treatment in a restaurant. I will never return here and I will tell people NOT to go here. I have no idea how they are business.:( :( This place has changed a lot! It used to be a classy sophisticated old town wine bar where customers were treated with respect. Our last experience at Kazimierz was the worst ever. My husband and I took a couple of friends there on a Saturday night.  The place was so loud that it was impossible to talk. We decided to switch to a quieter table.  Our female waiter was upset that we moved, I could tell by her attitude. To make story short, we were kicked out of the place because we complained about the waiter. The manager said "they stand by their waiters" The manager (Tony) said he would back her waiter up even though it was only her 3rd day working there.  We will never be back.Was looking for a place to eat tonight, I like to call first to see if there are coupons or specials going on, I believe it was Charlie who answered the phone, I asked if they had any coupon specials going which I remembered from the past, Charlie quickly answered not for nine months and hopefully never again, he didn't even bother to say why or ask if I wanted to make a reservation, so I am picking another place to go for the night, sorry Brioni's you lost my business, sounds like your getting to big for your britches, customer service over the phone was horrible.Don't eat at Banderas in old town. Their servers are great but their "reservation" policies are wack!! If you have a large group, EVERYONE has to be there before they will seat you. So if someone is late and another group come in before your last person shows up, you'll lose your table. Corporations suck! Eat at locally owned establishments.

The food is average. I've had better.RUSHED OUT THE DOOR:  My wife and I invited some friends to this restaurant.  At first appearance, the service appeared to be genuinely good, but then it showed its true colors.  The Mustard Barbecue Beef Ribs were so burnt that when we called back the waiter, he recognized this before we even said anything and took it back.  We were brought the check without requesting it and without being offered dessert. As soon as we finished dessert, our water glasses and napkins were removed.  When I asked--tongue in cheek--if it was because he wanted us to leave, he said "yes" just loud enough for us to hear.  Feeling lead out the door, my wife and I were quite embarrassed and will not be returning.Total. Waste.of.Time.



The Rawhide western town was an old-school attraction in way north scottsdale years and years ago, then it moved to the gila river indian reservation about 8 years ago, and it is NOT the same. The old rawhide was three times the size of this one and had way more attractions and things to do, especially as a kid. 

Went to this new location for the first time with company...it was lame, bordering on pathetic. This rawhide at wild horse pass is tiny, it is basically one big steakhouse, with 4 little overpriced gift shops down the dirt street. The petting zoo is tiny and boring, the games are boring, the old west shows cost now, and everything requires a "wristband" that costs 15 bucks. For what?? the two rides you have? No man.

The old rawhide had free shows, free attractions, and a lot more atmosphere, this place was sad and a ripoff. The parking costs 5 dollars, god knows why it's just a big dirt lot, and everything inside is hotel-markup price.

Total waste of time, unless you are 3 years old you will not enjoy this place. Skip this place and rent "tombstone" on dvd, it's worth the time and money, unlike rawhide.LET IT BE KNOW THAT I DID NOT ACTUALLY HAVE ANY WORK DONE HERE! 
Ok now that I got that out of the way.... 
Why would I write a review on a place I have never been you ask? Here is a copy of a note I wrote on Facebook: 

So I a a bit confused about the business practices of AAMCO located on Scottsdale Road just south of Thomas, maybe someone out there in facebook land can help me understand this weird trend a bit better. 

Sunday afternoon there is a knock on my door and it is a salesman. I don't realize this right away, I thought it was our neighbor or I wouldn't have opened the door. This overly gregarious guy hands me a coupon and begins his "buy this stuff speech" right away. It is a great deal, you buy a punch card and for roughly $80 you get 5 oil changes and a plethora of other neato, keep your car running in top notch condition services. I it thought how great it was because not even 1 day before I realized I was overdue for an oil change. But I was not about to give my credit card info, address or cash to some stranger standing in my doorway. 

To try to understand better a concept that shouldn't be hard I started asking questions: 

"So they only way to get this deal is to buy it from you right now?" 

"Yes." 

"Well I don't feel comfortable giving you all my information just because you say you are selling these coupons and are wearing an AAMCO shirt. You can understand my hesitation right?" 

"Well it is a secure transaction ma'am. All your information is sent right here by satellite but this nifty gadget I have secured to my belt." 

"That is all fine and good but I would prefer to just go to the business directly and purchase this deal." 

"You can't, they don't offer this deal." 

"What? I am sorry, did I hear you correctly? You are selling a punch card that I am going to be using at the business that will be honoring these cards but they don't sell it directly?" 

"We are a different company ma'am." 

"But you are wearing an AAMCO shirt." 

"That is because our company, which is different, is selling something that can be used at AAMCO." 

"Yea, I think I am going to.... 

I hadn't even finished my sentence when asshole grabbed the flyer out of my hand and says "Well I am going to give this to someone who understands the value and will buy it." 

Listen jerk I do understand the value of it. I also know that identity theft is a real problem in this county now. Just because you are wearing some t-shirt that says AAMCO on it and are carrying some flyers doesn't make you legit. Oh and bucko, just for the record, anyone can have a remote credit card processor, it doesn't make you any more special than the next Joe Bob that comes to my door. 

Feeling a bit miffed and also concern for AAMCO I give them a call. I wanted to make sure it was the real deal and and I wanted this family owned business to know how I was treated. As a business owner I know how important it is to make a great impression and they were not shining like a new penny to me. I was informed that there is an outside company that sells these coupons but they have nothing to do with them. 

"So you honor these coupons but it is a different company that actually sells them?" 

"Yes." 

"If I came into your shop could I get the same deal? I would just feel better having my information and credit card run at an actual establishment." 

"No we don't have that special, you would have had to buy it from that guy." 

"So you are willing to let my business walk out the door when I was ready to come down today and get my oil changed but only if I could get that deal." 

"I am sorry but we don't sell that deal." 

"Wow, ok." 

"I appreciate your call though and letting us know about the guy selling the coupons. If you want I can find the number so you can call that company directly." 

"You do realize that whether or not that guy works for another company he was selling something to be used at your establishment, therefore he is representing your business. Because of how rude he was to me and the fact that for some unearthly reason you can't or won't give me the same deal there is no reason for me to give you guys a try." 

"Sorry."

I JUST DON'T GET IT!! 

I own a business, I would never, ever turn away business, shoot I would even take competitors coupons!  I drive by this place everyday on my way to work.
I have seen the mechanics out front holding arrows that say "no waiting right now!"  or something similar to get customers.  Why oh why would you turn me away?This review is unfortunately about Jeff Harper at the Mesa location. My extended family and I came over Memorial Weekend and purchased numerous plants from the nursery during the 50% off moving sale. All the plants were doing well except one shrub which started doing poorly and dying the day after bringing it home. The receipt stated "receipt required for returns" so I got my 7 month old son in his car seat, drove the short mile up to the nursery and hauled the car seat and bagged shrub inside. I explained to Jeff how it wasn't doing well at all (all leaves had been fried when the label said "extremely heat tolerant") and asked if I could switch it out for another. He said I bought this on sale so there's no returns. I explained that I didn't know that since the receipt didn't specify sale items were nonreturnable. He said well we assume customers know that. There was no signage anywhere that this moving sale meant final sale with no returns and we weren't notified of that when we purchased the plants either. I went through the trouble of digging the plant up and bringing it back because I honestly thought they would honor what was listed on the receipt and didn't assume everything was final sale, especially with a plant dying the very next day.  When I told him I brought it back because I was basing this on what the receipt said, he interrupted me mid sentence grabbed the bag with the tree, screamed "FINE!!! You know what?! I'll go get another one!!!" And swung his arm as if throwing a discus and threw the plant so violently it flew out of the cashier area door onto potting bench knocking over and breaking several things. A worker was talking to a customer outside and witnessed it along with everything shattering to the ground. I was in such shock with my baby in his car seat on the ground I stood there for a moment unable to move. I grabbed my son and slowly walked towards my car hyperventilating. I have never experienced something so violent in a workplace and now two hours after it happened I am still shaky. I am only grateful I didn't take my four year old daughter with me to run that errand as I had planned to tomorrow. I am so saddened that a return request angered someone to the point of doing something like this, not only in front of me, but my child and other customers.  The worker did express how I didn't deserve that, that he was sorry that that happened and that I seemed like "a nice girl". I just wanted to let someone know in the family I will never drive by Harpers the same and could never recommend a place who's owner conducts himself so aggressively. I hope that no other customer ever has to feel so scared and threatened no matter the circumstance. To note, I do now see online all sales being final, but this should be listed on the receipt and at the register as well. Thank you, I hope Jeff understands he should never be conducting himself in a matter such as this. It was truly horrendous. **Not to mention he claimed if I would have purchased mulch and dirt I would've been able to return. The plant he threw back at me while I was walking to my car wasn't even what I had originally purchased. I didn't even want it but while I was putting my baby in the car the other employee placed it in my car. When I got it home there were literally over a hundred caterpillar/grubs in the pot. And as I drove away from the nursery slowly from crying I could still see Jeff marching around with my bagged plant fuming. I don't know what is with this guy but save yourself from ever dealing with him.**I took my mom here for her birthday dinner cause its where she wanted to go and we havent been there in a while.  I don't know if it was the over burnt roast beef, the under cooked chicken, or the shoe leather they tried to pass off as steak, but coming back here after 8 months left a very bad taste in my mouth. My family and I use to come here all the time when I was younger and the food was great, the atmosphere was wonderful and the staff was very friendly.  This use to be the place to be, now I would gladly spend the extra $3 and waist the gas to go to a different golden buffet (Golden Corral).  Do not waist your time and money on this place anymore, Trust me I won't.  I would rather eat out of the dumpster behind Taco Bell than ever eat at this Hometown buffet again.  You have lost a lifetime customer, and anytime your name comes up in conversation, I may just puke.I have had way better sea food at the Red Lobster and the price was nice.  Seriously,  my baked stuffed shrimp was overcooked.  My husbands Halibut didn't seem like halibut at all.  It was dry but edible.  Our third party had Lobster and clams and he thought it was terrible.  We are from Seattle and I guess we know sea food. Rich food does not mean good food.  The turtle soup was good.  The staff was friendly.  Not a reason to waste 200.00 bucks on a bad dinner.Can you give less than one star? I called on a friday night for delivery and the guy told me right away they were done delivering even though the website said they still had an hour left. He asked me to hold, but i could hear everything he was saying in the background. He was joking with his friends. Very unprofessional. When i went to pick up my food, the bar was covered in trash and dirty plates. The bar tender was taking shots and swearing up and down about how much he hated his job. I just about walked out when he started to ask me why i wasnt smiling over and over. His friends were hitting on me while i waited for my food. This place was disgusting and should be shut down for so many reasons. I will never return to this pThe service was so poor, I was about ready to call for delivery from Jack in the Box. Waiter offered lame excuses for his and the kitchen's slow service, citing that he had to wait the tables outside.  There was one couple outside!.  The place wasn't busy.  No excuse.  When the food arrived it was adequate.  Avoid this location if you have things you need to get done during the day, as you will be there awhile. Great menu, but you need to go to another location that believes in customer service.I am writing this review for my daughter and her friends. Saturday, May 24th my daughter and her group (6 all together) had made 6:30 dinner reservations the previous week. They arrived at the restaurant, needless to say was not busy, and sat down. To wrap up the whole night/situation was the service was slow and non attentive. I don't know whether the fact that this was a group of 17 yr. old kids but the young lady that was their server that night had them wait 40 minutes before taking their order after telling her twice they were ready and her response was "I'll be right back" and never came back. The server's attitude was rude. 40 minutes to order, REALLY! They were celebrating a friends birthday, needless to say did not turn out to be very memorable.I don't understand how a place like this can flourish. It kind of shows that those who play by the rules don't get ahead. Awful, flavorless pizza made by sketchy jerkoffs and delivered by weirdo sketch balls who show up whenever they damn well please. Avoid at all costs unless you want diarrhea soup for dessert.The entire staff at this office is completely incompetent. I went here in Jan 2012, and after waiting AN HOUR past my appointment time, I was finally taken back to the exam room. I had been experiencing a sharp ear pain and all I wanted was some medicated ear drops.... Dr Mendelson prescribed me NASAL SPRAY. In addition they made me do a hearing test which came back normal (which btw that lady treated me like I was 5 years old and special needs). I think the staff should take the hearing test themselves because THEY DON'T LISTEN to anything their patients tell them. I left the office in tears.This IHOP is just like every other IHOP except for its proximity to ASU campus. I have eaten there so many times that I cannot even count them. All due to proximity and availability, never due to desire. 

This is the only restaurant I have watched someone get sick in. It is packed after the bars get out at 2am. It is busy all night. Often with those who are under 21 but over 18 drinking coffee and acting as though it is their living room. 

Go here for sustenance only!!The most frustrating unintelligent staff you can imagine that go back on their leasing quotes! Don't bother!Bleck!  Chips that taste funky, like the oil is rancid.  Salsa, Macayo's used to have awesome salsa, but now it seems water-downed.  This place looks like it needs a power-washer and a deep clean.  And the food was meh and really not very good.This is one of those auto shops that gives all auto shops a bad name!  They overcharge and the service advisor lied to me about my car.  

I went to Hon-Amotive because I had a coupon for a $20 oil change and my poor little car was well overdue for one.  They are in a great location (the only thing going for them) and I was able to drop my car off and walk to Tempe Marketplace to get lunch while they worked on it.  

When the service advisor, Mike Brennan, called to let me know that they were done with the oil change, he said my brakes were down to the bare minimum and recommended replacing them.  

I'm clueless about cars (which he obviously picked up on) and if someone tells me something serious is wrong with it (like brakes!), my reaction is normally that I don't want to take on the expense, but what has to be done has to be done.  Luckily I was with a friend who recommended I hold off.

I went back, paid my $20 and picked up my car.  I talked to my neighbor who has an auto shop and he quoted me $100 less to do the brakes, so I made an appointment at his shop and when I took it in, he said I absolutely do not need new brakes!  He found nothing on my car to work on.  Thank goodness for honest mechanics like him!

I will never go to Hon-Amotive again and you shouldn't either!This is probably the worst food I have ever had in my life.  I should have run the other way just by the smell of the place, but I really wanted Chinese.  We ended up throwing it all away - including the flour tortilla (I kid you not) that came with the Mu Shu Pork.

Run the other way is my advice!I have to update my current review because after my dog received an echo-cardiogram at this clinic she was put on medication that only worsened her condition. She eventually died a week after consistently feeding enalapril to her as recommended . I was told that her heart murmur was only minor and that her condition was still treatable. They recommended cleaning her teeth because they were really bad. When I consulted with other vets prior they did not want to touch her. I was told that putting her under anesthesia could possibly kill her. Yet, this vet was comfortable telling me that he could put her under for a teeth cleaning before the echo-cardiogram.  I did the echo on my dog and scheduled an appointment with Petsmart to have her teeth cleaned.However, this never happened because she died before her teeth cleaning appointment.  Upon further research I discovered that heart murmurs could eventually lead to congenital heart failure within a  few weeks to a year. My dog was at the end stages of her condition, but I was never told this. I liked this vet originally, but I feel like I was misled about the seriousness of her condition. I would have appreciated honesty instead of paying for a $500 echo-cardiogram, $40 for a checkup, and $13 for her pills. In her last few days of life she was struggling to breath, until her heart gave out. Her death was very painful and I think her prescription medication had something to do with this.  One of the side affects is kidney failure ( I was not informed of this). I trusted my dog would get better after following the vet's orders, but instead she died.  I can't help, but think that if I had received a call from their receptionist to checkup on  how she was doing on her medication it would have saved her life. When I called their office to inform them of my dogs passing all I got was a "I'm sorry" and I was asked if I did anything with her body yet.  I tried to explain to her that I thought the pills killed my dog, but she was too eager to rush me off the phone. Surprisingly enough when I informed Petsmart ( where my dog had a health plan) they were more sympathetic.  Unfortunately, all I am left with now is my dogs ashes, debt on a credit card  and a broken heart. I will not be going to this vet again...ever.This place is hit or miss and today was a miss on many levels.  I felt like I should have been on a cattle car.  Although they weren't busy they sure didn't make any effort to pamper or to even make me feel like a valued customer.  The guy doing my pedicure was more concerned in the Jerry Springer type show on TV than in doing his job . . . cut my toe, messed up a nail and then they young lady doing my nails tried to fix it with 4 coats of polish. There were 4 nail techs talking nonstop between themselves then bursting into laugher . . . the other 3 clients in the room didn't look amused either.  I've been here numerous times and have gotten better service so maybe the one star is harsh but they really annoyed me today. I will visit another salon next time.Absolutely disgusting selection of meat. The produce isn't much fresher. And it never fails, whatever else I happen to need is out of stock. I loathe shopping here. I have complained to management before and it doesn't really do any good.Terrible!!!Please avoid.OMG, I'm the first to review this place.  My accountant is nearby, so we stopped here for breakfast.

Let's just say I won't be going back - for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Who ever heard of ala carte breakfasts?  Order eggs and toast is a dollar extra?  Juice glasses are a bit larger than a shot glass.

It's now after 1pm and my stomach is still gurgling!  Time for another dose of Pepto!This is the one of the worse Wendy's ever! 

Today I went in for lunch and one of the employees (with a raspy voice) was very loud and the other employees were telling her not to yell. Meanwhile, the girl taking my order had so many flakes in her hair I was afraid they were going to fall into my food. Talk about an appetite ruiner!

A few weeks back when I went thru the drive-thru, the same lady with raspy voice, took my money without saying one word, much less a thank you. Sorry, but if I give someone money the least they should do is say thank you!

I also don't like that you can't get your own sodas, especially since they ignore you when you try to get a refill. I will drive to a different Wendy's for my lunch break from now on.What an excuse for a store! I had a terrible experience! First thing I saw when I walked in was a fat lady with brown hair yelling at an employee about not getting enough rewards cards and he was on the verge of crying. Who would shop at a place where the managers are so awful to their employees?? I proceeded to look for my items, which they didn't have, and one of the employees (Stephen I think) was terribly rude! And once I got to checkout, the checker (Gary) bombarded me with question after question. So I  grabbed my things before he could check them and moved to another line. I got Nick at register 3. Going through his line was the ONLY good part of my experience at Kmart. He was very nice and we even struck up a conversation. He asked me ONE time about my rewards card, and when I said no, he didn't ask me any more questions. It was a relief! I will NEVER shop there again, because I heard he was let go and I would rather brave Walmart than go through Gary's line. Plus, that boss of their's is awful. Save your time and patience, don't shop at the Racetrack Kmart.I strolled in here because we were close by. First off, there was a Looooooooong line. We figured the food was good. We were really hungry so we stayed in line. It took forever to get to the front of the line. 

It also states that people should not sit until they have paid. Obviously, people do not follow this rule and the business does not enforce it. 

The topping to the cake was when I finally got to the front of the line and the cashier ignored me. Did not even bother to acknowledge me. A nice "I will be with you in a moment" would have been appreciated. Finally after refunding someone's money and ignoring me she finally took my order. As I gave her my CREDIT CARD she points to this TINY sign that read "CASH ONLY". I got sooooooooo pissed because it did not have this sign at the entrance.

Waste of my time! If you don't mind poor customer service, long lines, and people to tell you "only cash" once you've waited for a million years, then this is the place for you! Otherwise, go somewhere else. I highly encourage people to go elsewhere!ok so here is the thing....I really wanted to like this place because I am a big supporter of Downtown and the Arts District.
I was so amazed at the quality  of the food or the lack thereof .
We went for lunch, had salad, articoke, side of meatballs and a sub sandwhich.....the only thing that was edible was the sub...it was pretty good.
The bread is as exactly stated as below from the Yelpers...I heated the butter in my hand and it was like white wonder bread...no good.
The artichoke was by far the tipping point... so overcooked and mushy in a weird brown no flavor sauce packed with flavorless bread crumbs topped with a stabbed lemon slice on top.... Never order this, it was just gross.
The side salad was ok...basic bag salad....and  I have had a much better meatballs in Costco from the frozen section with the little old lady with the dixie cups.
We did split a cannoli, and the cream was odd and chalky but it and the shell, were sweet enough to pass for dessert.

The crazy part is the owner of 35 years was standing 10 feet away from us the entire time, and he never once asked how things were, and sometimes just sat and looked into space.

The grade from the Health Dept was an A on the wall but I would have to disagree, not to mention no paperseat covers in the restroom .

 I will never return unless it changes owners. I will watch out on these reviews just in case things get better.  We have way too many wonderful choices in Las Vegas to try to keep Chicago Joe's afloat when it is sinking......Joe, for the sake of history and all thing vintage please take pride in your place clean up your house.Mediocre Mexican food and they take forever!  This is a really small shack on Main Street.  A couple of friends insisted that we go there for lunch and it took over two hours.  Everything took way too long - it took them an inordinately long time to take the order, get the food and even get us the bill so we could leave.  Once we got the food - about an hour after we got there - the food was completely bland.  About the same quality as your average Mexican chain.  Avoid at all costs.Three stars is very inaccurate. The service was bad. The food was worse. I would not eat here again no matter how hungry I was. The fruit was not fresh. They did not toast my cibatta bread. They did smile while giving us crappy food though. At least they were friendlyDont stay at this place.. If there was a 0 rating i would give it that.
Feels comfortable to be around other folks from Hawaii, but the maids-housekeepers do NOT clean the rooms thoroughly, not even the bedsheets. Trash on floor. Its filthy.Beyond upset right now. Had issues with credit card in the  bar. I'm a local-- and MOD (Manager On Duty) couldn't be bothered apologizing and clearly (IMO) didn't know computer system at all. I offered to help with my background and he snapped at me. Too many people need jobs for this dude to have one and be so poor at it. I will be dealing with the GM so I'll update. I asked MOD for business card--he gave me one from someone else! When I questioned him--"oh, I thought you wanted his card." Really? I ask for your card and you try to throw someone else under the bus?Store was small and looked junky. Saw very nice cartoon cells but thought they were overpriced by at $300.00. Would not waste my time going there.Do not go to this venue at night unless you have a reservation, otherwise you will be wasting an expensive cab fare. They are very inflexible about adding late comers and can only accommodate 20 max per tour.  Even though the website says they recommend reservations, they should probably just require them in advance to save everyone the headache.I went there based on Yelp's reviews and truly wish I didn't. I believe that the person that cut my hair has absolutely no idea what cutting hair means and/or that was his first time doing it. He was done in about 7 minutes, 2 of which he had to go to the restroom wtf ?!. The next 20 minutes I spend explaining him that hair should be smooth and that I cannot have random chunks of hair all over.  It just doesn't look normal... at which point I gave up. The 5 star review are a joke and I would not recommend this place to anybody!We were feeling very hungry and too tired to cook dinner so we ordered us some Chinese. I had the general tso and my boyfriend had shrimp lo mein. The only perk was the total with delivery was only $18 which we can now see now why its so cheap. Both dishes had absolutely no flavor at all. Even the appearance and smell was just BLAH. Every other place I've gotten general tso from at least has some kind of vegetable in it. This has not one piece of veg. Sorry guys, you gotta step up your game!This place sucks.  They charged my wife and I for services that our insurance covered that they said wasn't covered.  We called our insurance and were told that not only did they charge us, they also charged our insurance.  We called and complained so we got our money back.  When we went back in to receive our refund, they were very cold and rude.  I can imagine that they double bill their other patients but have not been caught too many times.  If you had the misfortune of doing business with these people then I recommend that you carefully look over your charges to make sure you weren't ripped off.Roach spotted in ladies room closest to the Big Seafood Buffet. YUK!They will sell you a combo even though you didn't want chips. They are always looking to rip off. :-(If I could give zero stars I would.  We ordered Pepper Steak, Salt & Pepper Pork Chops and Beef Chow Fun w/ black bean sauce.  Everything was served quick, and I mean very quick.  Which immediately made my spider senses tingle. Well it tasted that way too, as if everything was just thrown together and brought out.  Flavor was non existent except for the MSG on the pork chops.  And, really, how can you screw up steamed rice??? Do not go here please!  If you value your taste buds, STAY AWAY! Let me put it this way, the Pepsi and fortune cookie was the best of the meal. Only got Chinese on this visit so perhaps the sushi is better? I don't know, but not even going to give this place a 2nd chance.Please, please, please tear this place down.  I couldn't stand it before I lived in Las Vegas, and I can't stand it now.  About the only thing this place is good for is to walk through when going from NYNY to Luxor.  It's just so gaudy... before you even get inside the doors of this hotel, they're yelling at you, "WELCOME TO EXCALIBUR!  ENJOY THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE BUFFET! PULL THE SWORD OUT OF THE STONE AND WIN A BALLOON!"  You get the picture.  Hopefully the picture is all you'll need.I wish I could give Excalibur no stars. I think this place is in need of a makeover. That makeover being imploding the damn thing and getting it off the Strip because it's an eyesore inside and out. 

I get it, it's probably the one place in Las Vegas parents can really take their kids to. The theme is kiddy, they have a "Dungeon" full of games and carnival-type experiences. The shows here are comical/fun. It's all about fun, fun, fun here!

Unfortunately the place is a dump. It stinks. The casino floor has that early 90s vibe to it. The food court is odd and out of place. The buffet is horrible. Other dining options are ridiculous too: Bucca di Bepo (poor excuse for Italian) and Dick's Last Resort. Okay, I've never been to Dick's, but who really wants to be insulted by their waiter? And of course the new BBQ joint, which I've heard good things about, and would be more apt to try... if it wasn't in Excalibur.

I cannot comment on their rooms since I've never stayed here, but I can only imagine what they must be like, unless of course, they've been renovated.

Overall this place just needs to go away. It's from a different era, one of which we moved on from a long time ago.This hotel wasn't ready for the amount of guests that it booked. They double booked our room even though we had made reservations months in advance. we were finally given a room (hours later).  we went out to enjoy our day/night, when we came back we discovered our keys no longer opened our doors. We had to  go back down to the lobby at 4am to get new keys.  To top off this horrific weekend stay,the hotel has a  resort fee that they neglect to tell you about when you check-in.  However,  I asked Prytzel (my desk clerk) if there were any other fees I needed to pay when I checked in.  She said "no unless you use room service." I had to debate with my check-out clerk, Cora, about not paying this fee that was not mentioned to me at my check-in or displayed at the check-in counter. This place is terrible. We will not stay here ever again.I stayed here the past month and did not like it at all. The hotel and lobby was full of smoke and it seemed like all the other hotels had a better way of getting rid of all the smoke. Nothing really exciting to see and no luck winning at the tables.DO NOT EAT HERE FOOD POISONING!! I have never been sicker in my life.  my dad and I ate here and we both got violently ill.  When we called to tell the restaurant the manager did not care and said it must have been something else- it was DEFINITELY SPAGO AND AN UNCLEANED SALAD THEY SERVED US!! STAY AWAY!Dump!!!!  Please take a wrecking ball to this place ASAP......  I'd rather sleep on the streets, next to the porn peddlers than ever stay a night in this rats anus...  I just threw up in my mouth thinking about it....*(My Circus Circus Nightmares)* 
Worst place to stay in Vegas! 
They just don't care! 
We made a reservation because my daughter had Cheer Nationals in Vegas and we thought this place maybe a kid friendly environment which it was geared toward kids with the Adventure dome and such. When we arrived first thing out of the car I noticed the awful stench of rotten trash in the over crowded parking structure and figured well that's Vegas baby. Oh no as we waited in line to check in I observed the walks of life this place attracted and the dirt caked on the carpet. In my mind I was thinking this is already not where I wanted to stay, but it was midnight and we needed to get some rest after a 4hr trip turned into 6 hrs. due to a fatal accident on the way in. As our turn came to check in we were greeted by a lady and she looked up our reservation as it was brought up we noticed the charges did not match what we booked. Hotel taxes and room rates were increased only a few dollars but that wasn't the point. The point was it was inaccurate! Well we were tired and just wanted to hit the sack so we paid and were going to deal with the issue at check out. The lady hands us our cards gets a map and write floor 5 and room 099 and directs us on the map how to find the room. So we proceed to follow the instructions. While trying to locate the room carrying bags of luggage and dragging two kids around for a 1/2 hr. we were unsuccessful locating such a room on the 5th floor of 099. Mad as hell as we walked back to the check in I slipped on a flight of stairs that had a plastic edge wearing flip flops and landed flat on my back. Writhing in pain for about 10 Min's. not one person even security walked over to me and asked if I was OK! And yes they saw! Finally making it to check out tired and in pain we asked to speak to the night manager. We explained out situation to him and asked what can he do for us. This guy was a young little punk with and attitude and should never of been put in a position as a manager. He did nothing but offer a extended check out time from 10 a.m. up to 1 p.m. OH YAY GEE thanks! So he resets our room cards and tells us floor 9 and the room number. After 10 Min's. we arrive finally. The room was a standard 2 queen beds and didn't appear all that bad comparable to a Motel 6. 
Morning arrives and is my daughters big day. We hop in the shower and first thing we notice was black mildew all along tub/shower line wall OMG REALLY! I have pictures of this gross and unhealthful environment. In horror and getting out of the shower I grab a bath towel again notice a problem not so much for me but my other half. They only provided 4 bath towels, Zero hand towels and Zero wash cloths. Running down a maid service problem was fixed but the point was these things should of been taken care of before hand. The entire day we were at the competition and visiting around town. We ate dinner at The Garden Grill in the Hotel before we went back to our room. Another horrible experience in itself. We were seated in a booth that the backrest of was loose and coming apart with on the other side a larger man was seated and every time he sat back it popped the backrest approx. 6" into my other half's backside violently. So we decided to relocate and mention it to the waitress. After that we heard the words chingada being used as she conversed with another waitress about us. We did not arrive back to the room until midnight and just went to bed. The next morning we packed up and wanted to get out of there. I think with our experiences we were just done with this place and decided to get one last shower before check out. The hell continues as my lady steps out of the shower I hear Oh MY GOD EWWWWWEEEE! I was thinking holy crude what now!!! Yes ladies and gentlemen when you thought this couldn't get worse well it did! She almost stepped on a cockroach getting out of the shower!!! Unbelievable!!! I scooped it up in a cup and wrapped it in the plastic trash bag to take to the check out lady. We finished and went to check out. I calmly handed the lady the plastic bag with the cockroach in it and asked in a very loud voice "Would you be willing to pay for a room that had these in it" She responded by setting the bag in the trash by her desk and said no in a hushed voice. We proceeded to tell her about our problems in detail and show her our photos. We asked what are you willing to do for us? She replied the best we can do for you is credit 1/2 a days stay and all the hotel taxes. Again we were unhappy and were tempted to dispute charges. 
We promised the kids we would take them to the Adventure Dome for some fun. This is how they get 1 Star! Now this part was geared for kids and have to admit I even had a bit of fun on the rides. We bought a unlimited day pass which was reasonably priced. And have to mention the had some very talented artist where you can get a cartoon, life like portrait hand drawn or a miniature clay face sculFor the rooms we stayed at the  West Tower for spring break and got a serious rash from the water or bed, the water had serious chlorine in it.  Just had a thin-ish blanket as the main blanket.   Bed was really comfy though besides that.  View was pretty good.

The food was alright drinks were not worth the money stayed away from the buffet because of the line, but thank god we didn't go there from the other reviews.  Went the caesars palace for the buffet even though it was 30$/person it was worth it.  The 24 hour deli was horrible, my sister got a chicken salad from there and it was just a big leaf with a scoop of per made chicken salad you put on sandwiches.

The whole place was filled with smoke, me and my sister got bloody snot from the second hand smoke, for a child's hotel went to all the others like the Mirage and Luxor and all those others it smelt way better and didn't have and barely any smoke.

The midway was just the same as the one in Reno but a little bigger and but had seats for the free act.   I am surprised that people actually bring their little ones to this hotel/Las Vegas in General.  This place was way understaffed, there was no room service and had water for $3.00 at the vending machine so, we just went to Walmart and got some big  jugs of water for $1.00.  The only pool was outside  by the RV camps, there was no indoor one. 

In summery its like the owner doesn't even care about their hotel/casino.
Please just stay away from this and go to another one.  Next time if we come back to LV we're just going to stay at the Mirage or one of the casinos that the monorail goes to.This place has terrible food! Several dishes we wanted, we were told they were out so to pick an alternative. Then the waitress seemed to have attitude ...she could have been tired I guess. Anyway, I did eat a little of each dish despite the bland&  old tasting food....I felt sick afterwards ...I don't recommend this place.If I could give them no stars I would. I walked in and was waiting to order my pizza when I see them cleaning the air vents with a dusty broom right over where they make the pizzas. Gross!! Walked out right then and there.So I couldn't really eat anything at this place. I let the lady know that I would just be sitting with my friend. She then told me that she was going to charge me to sit there. I asked if I had to pay even though I wasn't eating and she said yes. Such a stupid thing. I just said fuck it because I'm not going pay to sit there to watch people eat. What a terrible experience. They should have a disclaimer on their sign that says "you have to pay even if you can't eat anything here." I'll be sure to never go to this place again. It was beautiful inside but the lady taking orders was a complete bitch.I stayed at the Wynn in April, and was upgraded from a Tower Room to an Executive Suite courtesy of AMEX Platinum--very nice!  However, my sister ordered a bouquet of flowers through the Wynn Concierge, and I received a bouquet of wilted flowers--not very nice.  When I stopped by the concierge to express my disappointment with the quality of flowers, the concierge responded that my sister must have brought the flowers to the room herself--neat trick since she was sitting in NYC.  Finally, the concierge agreed to have someone check on it.  When I returned to the room at the end of the day, there was a new floral arrangement, and the wilted flowers remained.

The following week I received an on-line survey from the Wynn, and I expressed my disappointment about the flowers and the rude treatment by the concierge.  I received an apology via email in addition to a promise of a one level upgrade on my next visit to the Wynn.

Yesterday, my AMEX Platinum travel agent tried to book a return stay at the Wynn trying to use my email promise by the Wynn of an upgrade.  At first the Wynn denied any knowledge of this email.  Finally (after 15 minutes--my travel agent called me back), all the Wynn would do is upgrade me from their cheapest room to their second cheapest room (not the Tower Room to be upgraded to the Executive Suite as I had wanted).  I told my travel agent to tell the Wynn that I was again very disappointed by their service, and that I'll be making a reservation to stay at the Bellagio when I return to Las Vegas.Tried to go to the British restaurant in the hotel.  Pulled into the driveway from the strip to get to the self parking garage.  They must have had a show just get out because the line to get to the self parking merges with the valet exit and it was a cluster-fudge of traffic that took us about 20 minutes to get to the other side where the garage was.  We decided to not go to the Riviera and left when we had a chance to get out of there.  They have the worst entry/exit for cars that I have ever been in.  I will never go to the Riviera again.Ok, so I admit it, I LOVE Asian food...and I have to say, I've tried quite a few different places...so I honestly expected sooo much more from this place because people always say its "amazing" and the "best Chinese food ever"...Boy was I in for a surprise. 
So my Bf and I arrived a lil later on in the night, and the place looked nice...busy, and cozy, but when I saw the prices on the menu ( Which I was warned would be a lil outrageous) I was expecting that the food would be sprinkled in edible gold!! :)
Luckily they had a menu perfect for a couple..a "prefix menu" with many different options for under $40. Ok, not too shabby...The waiter was good..my bf drinks like a beast, and his cup was always filled, and my mouth was anticipating our tasty meal...
and then it showed up. 
Honestly, I don't see the hype. I have had BETTER Chinese takeout!!!!!!!! The Lo mein was not very flavorful, the mongolian beef was extra crispy it had turned chewy and stiff,and it was super salty!!! yuck!!! The only dish that attempted to save the meal was the honey shrimp..the shrimp was juicy and fresh! Dessert was our choice of cake shoved in a shot glass, and even that didn't turn my frown upside down "(
Would I come here again??.... Probably not..unless I wasn't paying for it. And even with that, I would be willing to try new dishes, but I don't feel there is anything worth my $15.95 a dish.The very first second I walk in, the staff in the front desk staff didn't even bother to look at us and gave us a very mundane welcoming. I personally don't think it's too much to ask to be pleasant and inviting when you walk in after booking a 3 night stay. They were unprofessional and inefficient. Making the check in process slower than it should be. After a long trip, the last thing you want is the staff wondering around aimlessly looking for forms. How ridiculous to make a simple task look so difficult. But it doesn't end there... We find our room, which I wish we never did. The room was absolutely disgusting. It looked like it had been abandoned and unkept. The bath tub was filthy. Well everything was. Even the remote. It had dust and CHUNKS OF FOOD stuck in between the buttons. And the beds?  probably shouldn't sleep on them unless you want a disease. The room was HORRENDOUS, even my dog hated it. We tried speaking with the manager, which was a waste of time. She not only refused to show us another room, she started raising her voice and verbally attacked my mom. There are no words for how despicable the whole experience was. Unless you really don't care about decent quality. I encourage you to stay somewhere else.This was my 5th, and LAST time here. The first 4 times I came here were amazing. Old school Vegas feel, amazing quality meat, attentive and knowledgeable wait staff, perfectly cooked food. NOT this time.

It's been about 2 years since my last visit, and things have gone WAY down hill! When we walked in the lady up front was too busy on the phone to acknowledge us, so we patiently waited. After about five minutes I started to wander over to the aging room, which apparently got her attention enough for her to finish her phone call. I had made reservations on Open Table two months ahead, and she seated us. Lucky us that we got the worst waiter in Las Vegas! This guy obviously hated food, and hated his job. I ordered the Rib Eye which comes with asparagus. I asked him for barnaise sauce. The food comes out, NO SAUCE. I remind the waiter that I had asked for barnaise sauce, he replies that its on there. I said, "really? Ive never seen invisible barnaise!" Can you please bring some extra? He comes out 15 minutes later with some brown sauce that looked like gravy. I said "what is this?" he tells me its barnaise. I said no, barnaise is yellow. He tells me that he is positive its barnaise and then walks away.

The quality of the meat was mediocre at best. My steak was actually tough. The seafood we ordered tasted like it had just been thawed out. The only redeeming part of the meal was the salad.

I think I'm just going to try and remember the good times and NEVER come back.All I can say is that we were starving and needed some heavy food to prepare us for a night on the town. Their food is pretty bad and I'm for certain that my burrito was cooked in a microwave and then smothered with red sauce. The beans they use are definitely canned and probably the cheapest you can buy. I don't know what kind of  beans they were but they were a weird brownish gray color and I picked them out of my burrito. Most Mexican places use refried beans. This place they were whole and undercooked. Yikes! We were lucky that we didn't get food poisoning.This place was pretty disgusting. The only thing I could recommend is the gumbo, Other than that the food was bad. The shrimp was probably Tyson brand, at least it taste like it. My sis asked for fried chicken, waitress said they don't have the ability to do any frying. The waitress then offered chicken tenders, she brought out but we later thought, if they don't do any frying,how are the tenders, fries, shrimp and fish fried? Could've been all microwaved. Everything was cold. I would not recommend this place to the homeless....45 dollars to wash my new car and they did not even get it clean  I have tried them three times now a complete waste of Time  retarded monkeys can wash cars better than them. And now I have a dent on the roof of my show car thanks you dumb assesI was exicited to come here because I had heard good things and I am very enthusiastic about BBQ.  The quality of the meat was not to my standards.  Everything I tried here was substandard.  I felt like everything in the restuarant was in need of a good dusting.  Little too heavy on the kitsch.  I didn't want a box.this had got to be the worst sushi i have ever had..it was only mysel,f so i sit at the sushi bar.i decide to get the ayce..so the sushi dude(can't really call him a chef)just keeps making dishes for me without me ordering.i was just going to pace myself,but whatever,i figure he knows what is good..well i don't think there is  anything very good there.the only thing i actually ordered was the unagi and the dynamite.the unagi tasted like it was pre made..oh yeah, i also ordered a half  roll with unagi,cucumber and avocado which was ok.the sushi dude made me what is called a no name(half roll),which was probably the best out of everything i had.while i'm working on the dynamite and the no name,he hands me the seafood salad.(says it is really popular)well the texture of the fish was like it had been thawed and frozen, and then thawed again.yuck...i decided i was full(i couldn't stomach anymore)..the sushi guy tried to let me pay ala cart (which was nice of him once again)but the lady said that i ordered what would be more than if i ordered ala cart,even though the portions were made small for me(that's what the sushi guy said anyways).i was too tired too argue and i didnt want the sushi guy that meant well to get into trouble..so i paid..i just wanted some sushi that was close to me but you do get what you pay for i guess..but then again, i can pay the  same price for much better sushi in Hawaii..and Hawaii is not cheap by any means..i'm a small lady though and don't require a lot of food..knew i should have cooked for myself tonight.DON"T RENT FROM THRIFTY and save yourselves the worst nightmare!
I reserved and paid for a 1 day rental, full tank , FULL SIZE SUV for $270.00 - and the garage guy was giving me a Chevy Equinox-small,tiny 5 Passenger SUV and insisted that that is a full size - Whoa dude, I'm not dumb! i complained at the counter, was told they have no fullsize suv,  so he voided the charge and said the $270.00 will be reversed.  5 days later, i see the freakin $270.00 charge on my credit card!!!!  CROOKS!One Hour and Twenty Minutes!!

That is how long we stood in line waiting to check in and pick up our car on Saturday, February 22, 2014!!

I had reserved this car on November 15th to be picked up at 11:30am on February 22, 2014. At approximately 11:00am we arrived and saw about 12 people in line.  "This shouldn't take long."   There was ONE agent working on our line.  Behind the same counter were FOUR agents working on the DOLLAR rental line.  Needless to say, their line moved much quicker.

I feel very strongly that the one agent was doing his best. At about 1 hour another agent joined the counter so now we had two agents. The agent that helped us, finally, was very nice, professional, and apologetic for the long delay. 

I am appalled by the amount of time it took to assist 12 people - 80 minutes divided by 12 customers = over 6 minutes each. If that is a typical time frame - then my suggestion would be to staff the counter based on the reservations.

TRUST ME - if I hadn't thought I had prepaid my $70+ bill - I would have left and gone to another rental car company. 


I am disappointed, angry, and appalled at the level of service given to us by Thrifty Rental Car.i would like to start off to say that i had a good meal. but i went to the bar had two drinks.. i played 55.00 dollars and i was ready to pay for my food they charged me for my drinks i said why when i played 55.00 they gave me the receipt that "was wrong".. it said i sat down there at 6:24pm and i arrived at 5:18 pm...which was wrong because, i made it there at 6:35 i picked my daughter up then came over to eat for almost 45 minutes. to make a long story short i asked them to go over the cameras they said, "they don't work" management was rude and she did nothing to help me. not even go back on the receipts an clarify that i wasn't lying. im not please and i feel like this company is getting over on alot of people with "gambling".. its not about the food or the drinks it about how she gave me receipts that clearly showed i wasn't there at that time. nacy g. our waitress was amazing wonderful server!... management sucks!!!!  I WOULD LIKE FOR EVERYONE TO BE ADVISED THAT THEY ARE TAKING PEOPLES MONEY!! AND THEIR GAMBLING MACHINES ARE WRONG! AND BETTER MANAGEMENT! I WANT MY DAMN MONEY BACK HIGHLY UPSET AND I WANNA PUSH THIS FURTHER CAUSE THIS IS HIGHLY UPSETTING!Service and ice cream was fine. My complaint is about the condition of the restroom. Absolutely DISGUSTING!!! There was a dead baby roach under the  filthy sink. If there is a baby, there are obviously more!! The toilet was so filthy I didn't even want to go near it. I refused to let my 4 year old daughter use it. There is graffiti on the paper towel dispenser as well as the back of the door. In white writing on the back of the door it says "only fags write this" with an arrow pointing to some other graffiti. They were not busy when we were there today, someone could tend to that bathroom! When I told the cashier, she just said "I know." I realize this a public restroom, but for the price of their ice cream, I should be able to use a clean restroom when I'm there. Soooo incredibly gross!!!We have been getting our lunch 3 days a week from the Vons deli for about 7 months now. There is one employee there that is ALWAYS in a bad mood and rude and I called and spoke with the assistant manager which changed nothing. Yesterday my assicoiate went and picked up our lunch and the manager happened to be in the deli, so he told her about our experience and was given one excuse after another about her poor customer serivce and attitude. Ok here comes the best part......Today when he went in he was told that you have to pay for the bacon now! Really for the last 7 months we have not been charged for bacon by ANYONE who makes our sandwich and now that we complained we are being punished for saying something! As a manager myself in a customer service industry, this is a complete disgrace and joke.Tried to give this best buy another chance but ran into a very consistent lack of customer service. Witnessed several others very frustrated with the lack of help!  The merchandise stocking is also very poor. Out of many items. I will continue to buy all electronics at Amazon.Watch out  from this thief  people I took my Mercedes for repair the try to still  $1.000 more then the Mercedes dealer for the job  the add 10 extra hours for the job when it should take only 2 hours I .i told Them not to touch the car I took the car to  Mercedes dealer and less then 2 hours job done for $ 700.00 .  and Europa  car want $1700.00 big big different  .stay away from them .What's with the freshness and quality of ingredients served in this city??

Ordered some wings and a salad for delivery. Shouldnt be that complicated and I should not feel completely sick to my stomach a few hours after finishing eating!

Chicken wings were way overcooked, and tasted funny. Salad was alright, but it felt like it was prepared 48h prior, and left in the fridge for the next delivery order (mine!)

Seriously feel like I am going to puke now and have stomach cramps. And I dont have a delicate stomach, I mean I have lived and traveled in Africa and Amazonian jungle.

Do I have to stick with 3* Michelin restaurants to not get sick in this city!?  GrrrrrrService was worse than bad.This is the closest DQ to my home and my wife loves DQ but we won't be going back to this one. First off they proudly boast that they make their own Buster Bars as opposed to "the factory made ones". Well their home made Buster Bars are substantially smaller, have little fudge and about three peanuts; a waste of money. Next trip we ordered dip cones. You wouldn't believe how fast they melted. It was like trying to eat a pint of milk. All three of us could have used a shower. Most recently we ordered Blizzards; one cookie dough, one snickers and one banana split. They were all like chilled soup. I went to the counter and described our experiences with the quick melting cones and soupy Blizzards and was told "that was normal". Normal for who? We'll still be visiting DQ's, just not this one.Horrible service. Workers are very rude and lack serious customer service skills. My drink just didnt taste right like the syrup was low on the machine. The woman at the window told me it was perfectly fine. Ok so I get home and something told me to look at my burger and low and behold my bread is moldy. And no it was not just burned bread! I threw it away and will never, ever, go back to this place. Thats what i get for wanting some fast food. BEWARE! These people are going to get someone sick and they are lucky I did not ingest any of this B*llsh*t! Fyi... Dont waste your money, time, or health here!!!! DO NOT EAT HERE!I've order from Mark Rich's pizza several times and every time it takes more than an hour to deliver anything. I once waited more then 2 hours for a pizza to be delivered to my house which is less then 10 minutes away.  Not only do they take an unacceptable amount of time to deliver, they deliver cold food. I feel I have given this place more than enough opportunity to deliver hot food in a timely manner and they failed. I will no longer be a customer.WOW, Extremely overpriced and rude.  I understand you don't want kids in your establishment but you are right next to a children's museum.  We went there starving and left mildly hungry after dropping $50 on ok pizza.  I have definitely had better at a lower price but the main reason I am even reviewing this place is how rude the wait staff was.Visited based on all raving reviews, and because the owner is supposed to be from phill (where we work) with several friends on our escape weekend. Had a borderline unreasonably long wait time as reservations are not accepted, however they sent us next door to a wine/beer and cheese bar type place, so that killed time pretty well.  My one friend ordered a basic white, and they were out. Not a good sign. We got seated, outside, which is lovely, and the table is so uneven my beer falls over. That sucked but I wasn't a fan of it anyways (nut brown ale, which I usually like, but I'm not faulting anyone for my tastebud preference). The selection of pizzas consist of 3 red sauce and 3 white, that's it. Ok. I can deal with that, because at the bottom of the menu  also has a selection of "additions." I figure I can make my masterpiece. I try to request the addition of a red sauce to the white pizza and you would have thought I was asking the server to kill her first born child. No exception was made. I wanted to have a side of sauce and the explanation was "the chef policy."  Forgive me, but who on earth can dictate what I think will taste better?  I offered to pay for the added sauce but still, no dice. I went ahead and ordered, and got a pizza that was absolutely covered in onions (which, were good in a much smaller quantity, but I guess I'm crazy if I prefer pizza w onions vs onions w pizza. ) The rest of the table tried 4 other types of pizza, none of them were finished. We were all very disappointed.  We are not going to recommend nor return.Terribly overrated in almost every aspect. People will then ask: "Well, why is it so busy then?" Busy does not translate into a "quality experience" - hence the case here at Lotus of Siam. This is a tourist trap since it is close to the Strip with cabbies parked all around. This was also my third and final trip to "Lots of Siam". The food lacks flavor, and the Tom Yum soup is virtualy tasteless. The staff fouled up our orders and seemed indifferent to our needs even after it was quite obvious that we were unhappy / displeased. There was a complete lack of care and comfort / concern as well as management presence. Of all the Thai restaurants in town, this may very well be one of the worst I have been to. We will never return.All I can say is what a joke.  my feelings about this place were confirmed.  I had a burger and something called southwest fries?????  the burger was soooooo over salted it wasn't even funny (no I didn't eat it) and putting tons of Spanish  paprika on soggy fries is a total waste of time and not to mention gross.   Also the place was not very clean would it be an inconvenience for someone to clean all the glass vases above the bar.Oh man ... this is NOT good pizza ... it's CHEAP and they usually have an all you can eat lunch buffet but the 'za is about as good as Little Caesar's Pizza (i.e. "not so much")No Parking, no Parking, sad for a mega hotel complex, had tickets to a 9pm benefit concert . Valet was closed (full) at 8pm. drove around the complete hotel and garage for 1 hour. had to give up and go home.  No Parking sucks..The traditional New Orleans Gumbo was tasteless, the lobster bisque was too salty, the jumbo lump crab salad was anything but fresh, the BBQ shrimp was swimming in BBQ sauce......, we were amazed by the poor quality of food this restaurant serves, we ordered great wine and that's the only thing we finished, service was O.K.  I would skip this restaurant altogether.We were sat at 9:15. Dinner arrived at 10:45...  Those of us not drinking wine were not offered anything other than water. Once dinner arrived a couple of the steaks were placed in front of the wrong patrons. Instead of just correcting the issues, the server/manager restated what I ordered (the bone in NY strip). The steak in front of me was very clearly a filet. Our wine glasses were not cleared until our dinner plates were...
The steaks were decent. Not amazing, but adequate...  
Restroom was dirty, toilet seat damaged, no hand towels. 
A relatively pitiful attempt at a fine dining experience.For some reason they did not have my reservation that I paid for through Amex. They blamed Amex, Amex blamed them. At the end of the day, I paid and got a room but they took no responsiblity or even tried to make it better. No customer service, the people were mostly rude. The only nice person there was at the buffet. An ok buffet if you like buffets... but over all, this place is out dated. If Joel Robuchon was not there, I would not bother going there at all.  So many other great hotels to try at around the same place. My sister stayed across the street at the Tropicana and that place was way more updated than MGM and at a better price.Please be aware of the time share sell!! Like those postings not recommended, the guy on the street promised the free stay was to be in the Cosmo, but that was not true. He promised there would be only three questions and a visit to their rooms, casino, and a brief preso.  Definitely not true ... The preso lasted an hour, they don't have a casino if their own, and the model room was a pit!! The carpeting from the elevator to the room was stained and worn.  The pool was small and crammed between two large resorts. Last of all the free gifts were misrepresented.This place sucks!Just reviewing the buffet and lobby area....I was on one of those 24 hour 7 buffet passes and had dinner there. It tasted pretty good but I could have done without waking up at 3 a.m. with violent stomach cramps and a less than pleasant exit the next morning. Also the building itself? Dark, old and sad. The bathrooms at my high school looked and smelled about the same!I came here with a group of friends because I have always heard good things about this place.  Our server was friendly and really attentive which was a plus.

Other than that everyone's food was average and I had a salad with grilled chicken added.  My chicken tasted like tuna.  Enough said.Please spend the extra cash on a better hotel, even if its off the strip. Sahara is not worth it. 

1)A fun weekend with my girlfriends and I, was what I was expecting. We arrive in what seems like an old and dirty parking structure. There was absolutely no maintenance. Inside the parking structure, the walls where filthy and full of what seemed to be peoples footprints on the wall . I guess it was the thing to do inside the parking structure. No one bothered to clean or paint over the walls. 

2) We arrive at check in. I'm not making this up, we were the next guest to be seen in line, it took approx 45 minutes to be seen. The line was out the door for people that needed to check in. They had only ONE person working the front desk. As I'm waiting to check us in, my girlfriend goes outside by the pool, in search of a cocktail. The bartender ignores her for about 3-5 minutes. My friend finally asks for his help and a drink. 

3) We start walking to our rooms, elevators are old and smelly. The hall ways stink and not to mention, there was old, tore down wall paper. We enter out room and I swear to god, i felt like we were staying at a mobile home park. The bathroom was tiny, bath tub was old, old wall paper etc. Beds were old 
and smelly. Carpet was dirty, i had to wear my sandals to get around. Everything is just plain old and not updated. We had a HORRIBLE view, we had windows that's wouldn't shut, YES would not shut!!!! We couldn't even leave our valuables inside for fear of theft. The lock and handles were broken from the windows. 

4) Room service was not in sight for hours. I kid you not, I saw a neighbors room service i.e plates, cups, old food with flies around it my whole weekend there! No one bothered to even pick it up 

Good things- Nascar cafe Yum! Hotel rooms are cheapAsked for a non smoking. They put us on the 15th floor - directly above the smoking rooms. Couldn't breath when we entered the room due to the smoke. Back down to the check in desk. "Oh most people have the same problem with those rooms" I was told after standing in line for 30 minutes. We were put into a room on the 7th floor. They advertise newly remodeled which actually means new wallpaper and furniture. Our bathroom sink is rusting through around the drain, the bath tile has mold in the grout, water pressure is strong until you turn on the shower, then it becomes a trickle and the faucet handle slowly slips from hot to cold. Skip the buffet - I think the furniture and fixtures are older than me and I grew up in the sixties - unless you enjoy cold, tasteless food. Why one star then? The hotel is centrally located.Omg!! This place is disgusting!
 This is my second time at the flamingo. Several years ago we came here for our first trip to Vegas, we really enjoyed it then. However, this time our experience was not the same.

 First off..check in. What a line, that didn't seem to move. We Sat in line for about half an hour moving about ten feet. Finally we saw someone using the express check 
in kiosk, we decided to give that a try. Good news, we were checked in in about ten minutes, bad news,  no one to tell you about the fact that you get two passes a day for the gym or free internet, especially since the sign in your room says it costs money!! Total bullshit.
So I picked a non smoking room on the 19th floor.
First the elevators, which where old and dingy and dirty. A couple times they stopped on odd floors, opened the doors about 5 inches and just sat there until we hit a button. Alot of beeping and squelling.

 Our room happened to be the farthest room from the elevator which made us walk thru what had to be a smoking room area. The smell walking thru this area to get to our room was disgusting. I seriously wanted to throw up. The carpet was so old and stained and dirty. Riped in many places, and so jacked up that it was rippling down the hall. I tripped over it a number of times. Having had back surgery recently this was very hard and dangerous for me to walk on.
The main room itself was ok. Actually liked the firm bed and at first liked the faux wood laminate, however this is really annoying late at night when drunk people are stomping around, and also really hard on your feet after lots of walking.
The bathroom was horrible! Filthy old and moldy. The toilet paper holder was falling out of the wall. The bathtub was moldy around the edges with the soap holder all cracked and broken tiles. Mold on the ceiling and old broken fixtures. The cabinets had chipped old paint and were separating from the wall.  Even the cups were paper. 
Overall this place made my skin crawl. I will never go back.
On a positive more, if you go to the buffet around 1030, you pay for breakfast, but they start bringing out the crab and other lunch items, but you only pay for breakfast.

spend your money at NYNY. Rooms are super nice. Just booked here after our flight got canceled!!I'm a longtime Harrah's player/stayer.  I've stayed at all of the properties and Flamingo has always been a fun place to stay, even if it could be updated.  

HOWEVER - with the Cromwell opening next door, and the ENTIRE SIDE of the building facing Bellagio and Paris engulfed in NOISE from the rooftop pool nightclub...until 4am...it SHAKES THE WINDOWS.  Worse yet, it's all techno crap.

It might be ok if you're 25 and don't care about sleep (we've all been there) - but if you're a longtime Vegas player/visitor like me - go somewhere else FAR FAR AWAY from the Cromwell pool.  I blame Harrahs for ruining Flamingo - they own Cromwell too.

Oh, and because I was so pi$$ed off about the 4AM window shaking BOOM BOOM BOOM from Cromwell - the other flaws in Flamingo (dirty carpets, unreliable elevators, slow check-in) became that much more evident and irritating.

AVOID FLAMINGO IF SLEEP MATTERS TO YOU AT ALL.I just got back from Las Vegas with two of my girlfriends.  We stayed @ the Luxor.  This hotel is a total disappointment.   The room had 2 queen beds, and enough space for 3 women to unpack and move around.   WE requested for a nonsmoking room and per the lady at the front desk, we got a nonsmoking room.  But the smell of smoke was so heavy, it felt like there is a man sitting in the closet just blowing out smoke all day long.   The closet must of somehow suffered from some kind of water damage because the wood at the base was bended.   The room was dark, the wall paper looks like it needed to be replace.   Next is the bathroom.  There was a hole on the wall in the bathroom.  No joke, a hole in the wall.  This hotel is nothing like anything I would expect from a 4 stars hotel in Vegas.  It was a total disappointment.Not to happy with these hotels, they want to charge for everything, including certain areas of the pool.  Don't come in June seems to be college students and young adults.  Annoyed with pool area they don't have enough recliners for the guests.  Can be in the pool during the day.  We werent loving our room in the pyramid, only 1 elevator and have to walk clearly around the building to get to our room, they were accommating when we requested a room in the towers!We stayed here for three nights, over Labor Day weekend.  This was a return trip to Vegas after going in February 2011.  That trip was great and we were sad to leave.  We were looking for the same kind of trip this time around, but cheaper, so we stayed at Luxor (last time we stayed at Paris).  Unfortunately, everything about our stay was awful and we were actually relieved to return home! I will try to break down the awfulness that is Luxor:

Rooms: Our room was in dire need of updating.  The television set was old school and the air conditioner reminded me of Motel 6.  I don't so much care about modernization, though; the worst part by far was the bathroom.  Our shower had tons of soap scum, as well as dust.  The door was peeling and cracking along the bottom.  When I opened my washcloth the first night, it was to find a long black hair inside. I am blonde.  It was so gross that I found myself regretting that I didn't bring shower shoes.  The towels smelled burnt- not sure if they were old or if they had been previously used in smoking rooms, but even my 7 year-old commented on the towels being "stinky."  

Food: I can't say enough about how bad the food was and I think this was probably the worst part of our whole weekend since we get very excited about eating.  The More Buffet was quite simply the worst I've ever been to.  It should be hard to screw up breakfast, but they managed.  The eggs were runny and had the oddest taste.  The scones could double as weapons, they were so hard.  The only item my son ended up being able to eat was a bowl of cereal each day.  Being economical during this trip was really important, so we needed to take advantage of our two free buffets per day.  In our defense, we tried the other places, but they were equally bad.  We ate at Rice and Company and had the  most bland teriyaki chicken ever.  We ate dessert at the Pyramid Cafe and it was just... gross.  

Customer Service: The first incident took place at check-in, when we were handed our room key and directed to elevator 2, which ended up being the wrong elevator for our room, and which resulted in quite a hike across the hotel.  We had to find out on our own that elevators 4 were the ones we needed.  We also experienced poor customer service at the More Buffet, Rice and Company, and Pyramid Cafe.  The servers at the buffet just seem very brusque and were not friendly... (maybe I am just so upset over the gross food that I interpreted it that way).  The hostesses at Rice and Company were snooty and acted like they were annoyed with us.  Our server at the Pyramid Cafe was certainly a character, but I just don't like it when the server becomes a big part of your dining experience.  I think they should be unobtrusive.  

Besides all of these cons, you know those salespeople that you find at every hotel and casino that try to offer you tickets when you walk by their kiosks? Well, they are staggered throughout the floor of the Luxor, so there's no way to avoid them, and they were by far the most aggressive and rude ones I have ever encountered! One in particular was very demanding that we follow him to get free tickets and acted offended and angry when we told him no- several times.  We were literally accosted at least three times on the way to eat breakfast every day. 

I read below that this is a good place to go if you are in your 20's and perhaps that's true.  There were a lot of drunk jerks running around over the weekend.  At nighttime, when we went to the buffet, I had to tell my son to close his eyes because there was always a girl pole dancing right in front of the escalator! Just not really a family atmosphere.   

All in all, we decided that we would never stay here again, even if it was free, even if it was a free suite! We chose not to complain to management because a) we were afraid of what management would be like after all these other experiences, and b) there was really nothing that could ever entice us to return to this place, so why bother? Oh, I forgot to mention that there was also a hidden $50 "resort fee" upon check-in (we had paid our entire fare through Expedia beforehand), which might not have been so irritating if there was anything resort-like about the place.

Bottom line: If you are looking for a place to sleep and that's it, this would be fine.  If you care about comfort, class, environment, etc., stay away!I would not recommend anyone to stay here. My girlfriend and I stayed here for a week and find it very inconvenient, in a lot of senses. First of all, there is no wifi in the room. The only way you can connect to internet is through a one meter long wire. And if you have a Mac, instead of a pc, you are doomed, as the cord only works for pc. Moreover, we stayed in the 30th floor, the cellphone signal is terrible, you would constantly get disconnected while making phone calls. Because of this, the 3G is really slow while in the room. In a word, if you want to use internet in the room, don't stay here. Secondly, it's at the south tip of strip, going to the central is a lot more troublesome than what the map might have suggested you. Thirdly, there are a lot of workers doing "promotion" in the casino floor, they will try to lure you with free show tickets, but it will waste a lot of your time. My girlfriend and I call these spams. In the end, don't get fooled by the outlook of the hotel, the inside is a bit old and outdated. I, personally, will never ever stay in this hotel again. It is just a terrible experience staying here.Got there on a Tues night 10:30 pm no valet parking, long check-in line, employees standing around joking. In the room no coffee maker, no robes, no Wi-Fi, food blah and over-priced. No in room insulation so you can hear every drunken conversation after hours. Charge extra for the pool if you don't want to "hang" with the MTV pool party crowd. Incessant dance music played. Chris Angel a big disappointment, Carrot Top was the best thing about this hotel. Contracted athletes foot from the shower as a souvenir. The Pharohs would surely weep.Stayed here on a business trip. I took off a star because there is no in room Wi-Fi. Then I took off the the rest of the stars because there is no in room Wi-Fi. How is there no Wi-Fi? Also the water pressure in the shower was pretty weak.WORSE SERVICE EVER!!!! Incompetent workers who are rude & had us wait over three hours to check in. It's 6 am & all we want to do is sleep but we can't because the workers have no idea what they're doing. They tried charging me 75% more because they made a mistake & failed to take responsibility. They barely lifted a finger to help. We had to make calls to their customer service to get the problem fixed. Don't waste your time, energy, or money.I wish I didn't have to give this hotel a star because I wouldnt! My birthday weekend was completely ruined by this hotel on two different occasions. The first was when my car was damaged while in the care of the luxor! Valet brought my car to me after being Parked in the hotel for two days and there was noticeable damage! After I put in a claim, the hotel told me they could not do anything for me to fix my car! Upon checking out I realized I left my wallet in my room, I immediately went back and it was gone! The last person in my room was the bell hop. After two hours of putting up a fuss about my belongings being taken because I couldn't get home due to the fact that my money and ID were in my wallet, the bell hop finally gave it back. How could you steal from a guest?! This hotel has been BY FAR the worst hotel ive stayed at in Vegas! They didnt even try to compensate me for either incident. I will NEVER stay here again! Aside from the incidents the entire staff were rude and not friendly at all. I would NOT recommend staying at this hotel.I stayed 3 nights at the Luxor with my wife and 8 year old son. We drove up from Laughlin, so arrived at check in at 1 PM. Check in is a 3PM. It was Wednesday, so I figured there would be a room available, and there was. But the Luxor's policy is you must wait until 3PM, or pay $20 to enter room early. Paying for late check out I can certainly understand and have paid in the past, but I have never had a hotel charge to enter an otherwise vacant room a couple hours early in the afternoon. We paid the $20, no big deal. 
We went into the room and found the internet was a 20 foot long crinkly wire that came out from behind the TV. No wireless internet. I had not seen a wired internet since my last hotel stay in a 3rd world country. Luckily I had my trusty laptop, but our Ipad was useless except for our 8 year old being able to play a game. 
The flat screen TV was inside a closet with large doors that opened outward only 90 degrees. Which means you must sit directly in front of the TV to watch it, or the doors are in the way. Why not just remove the doors?
As others have mentioned, there were pubic hairs on the bathroom floor. Perhaps the cleaning staff keep a jar of them to sprinkle around for ambiance, I don't know. There was also some kind of yellow chunky stuff stuck to the wall next to the toilet. 
My wife brought our 8 year old son to the pool. About 108 degrees outside. You want shade? Another $20. The room itself is inexpensive, so no big deal.
Worst experience was when my wife brought our son back to the room from the pool. Her key would not work. She called me to come to the room and try my key instead of going downstairs with our son and waiting in the check in line for a new key. I was eating at the Excalibur and had just received my food. I told her to keep trying and I would hurry eating and be there as soon as I could. I ate fast and went to the room. Pretty long walk. When I got to the room, my key would not work either. We went back down to the long check in line in the lobby. We waited in line again and at the counter we talked to  a receptionist who was apparently having a bad day. She told us the keys would not work because we had mishandled them and thus demagnetized them  She strongly suggested we should have known better and had we not been so careless with our keys, we would not have suffered this inconvenience. 
When I asked her if it was then all our fault, she said she would not talk to me anymore since the room was reserved in my wife's name. She then asked me "Who are you to this woman? Are you even with her? I'm not talking to you." Maybe she thought my wife had just met me on the Strip.
We then asked to speak to a manager. We were directed to the front desk manager on duty at that time. The manager was very polite and apologetic. We got our keys straightened out and had no more key problems. She even comped us $50 to use at the buffet.
I would have given the Luxor one more star had the first receptionist not been so rude and surly. 
The Luxor was the least expensive hotel on the Strip when we checked. But next time I will spend a little more and hopefully get a better hotel.Visited MB over the Memorial day weekend... 
Not so great experience... they are so hungry for $$
They will try to milk you for every penny.  
The Wave pool is great but they were charging $75 for Umbrella and $100 for two beach chairs!! We requested for a Microwave, which I thought was complementary, but when we got the bill, they charged $35 per day!  They also charged for a bottle of Fiji water ($8) & cookie($10) which we never ate in the room!
Never again ugh..Craftsteak was very disappointing. We did one of the sampler menu items. The ribeye was tough and way over salted. The breaded shrimp,first course, was dry and tasteless and the cocktail sauce was unremarkable.   The potatoes au gratin were so so and a little undercooked. The balsamic carrots were extremely tough- inedible. The  lamb chops, beet salad, and asparagus were phenomenal.  For less than the $110 per person, we could have gone to a Houston's or Ruth's Chris and gotten a much better meal. The server was in our face agressive. 

I am not the kind of person to send the food back. I just will never go back to the restaurant.

I would have given this place 2 stars, but I feel ripped off.OVERRATED and OVER-PRICED Mexican food.....If you have any experience at all with good, quality Mexican food, and know any better, good from bad, you will not like this place.  If you live in L.A., S.D., AZ or TX, you probably know what is good and what is not.  If you taste the salsa, the guacamole, or the margaritas, you will be very disappointed.  A very gimmicky, 'plastic' Mexican restaurant with little flavor, no variety, and nothing unique.  Most of the (young) people eating here are loaded drunk from the bar and pool scene, hence the great reviews....the ONLY explanation.  Don't waste your time or $$$ here when there are tons of better quality food options in Vegas that are comparable in price, hire top-rated chefs and taste much better.  Don't be fooled by the 'rock and roll' image this place sells from the outside....it's basically a Mexican 'Hooters.'

A great alternative for dinner is the buffet at the Wynn Hotel.....hands down the best buffet I've ever been to....Everything is fresh, high-quality food, and every variety of foods you can imagine, including desserts!  Pastas, meats, salads, soups, seafood (endless, and popular, crab legs and lobster), etc.  Has been awarded top buffet in Vegas for a reason!  You won't be disappointed.  Always crowded (for good reason) so reservations are a must!  The various steakhouses around town are also a good option.  Vegas has all the top name steakhouse names in the country.The dinner buffet is so bad, the only reason I came here was because my friends wanted to experience a buffet.  Ick.  It's so hard to make food taste delicious for thousands of people everyday, every meal.  Everything was bland, over cooked, soft, or mushy.  I only took a small bite to taste and what I didn't finish, just left on my plate.  What a waste of food.Worst buffet I've been to on the strip.

Their desserts are delicious. They have cotton candy and chocolate covered strawberries. 

The food, however, is bland and boring. The selection is poor. Definitely not worth time and money. Go somewhere else! I would suggest walking over to Paris and eat at theirs.I hate this place. Everyone who works here is SO FREAKING RUDE and obnoxious and it's always so packed that you literally can't breathe. By midnight there's nowhere to stand without a bouncer demanding that you move. There are lines to go anywhere, upstairs, downstairs, down the hall, to a different room, to EXIT, EVERYWHERE. Also, they're bitchier about getting girls in here, but I don't know why. 

Even when we have a table, it isn't much better because you can't ever leave your little area without facing the mob around it. I don't understand how this place is still in business with Tryst and XS next door.i went here once many many moons ago and then again recently.. this club is too damn small.. there also way too many kids here..I have very NEGATIVE feelings about Tao - I have never in my life felt more disgusted about any establishment. I had to deal with borderline harassment from their security and bad service. There are so many better options to choose from in Vegas, and Tao should really be your last and let me reiterate LAST option. I believe the current yelp ratings comparatively to other clubs speak for themselves if you have to ask me. 

The first time I came to Tao it was for Hardwell on a Thursday night, the weekend before NYE 2012. Earlier that evening my friends and I arrived early for the ladies open bar happy hour. I ordered a drink and one of my guy friends took one small sip from it. Seconds later, two of the security men stormed up to me, grabbed me, and took me into a small room by the back wall without any explanation. 

My friends were screaming and banging on the door asking for them to release me as they were very worried. One of the security guards very rudely explained that because it was a ladies open bar, I was not allowed to have my guy friend take a sip from my drink. 

Ok - but lets be real here - if that were the case did it really require them to take me to a secluded room away from the public and put me in harms way? They could have just told me in the presence of others, as it is not a big issue. I am glad that they released me after explaining, but really, none of that was necessary. That experience left a bitter taste, as it was unnecessary trauma. 

My second experience was more recent. I was at Tao for a joint bachelor/bachelorette party two weekends ago for Fabulous. Because the couple decided to do a package deal, we had dinner earlier at the Tao Bistro for 15 people. As part of the package, there was dinner and bottle service provided for the group. As soon as we got to the club, we were given a table outside of the main room which was not ideal but that was ok. 

FYI, the food at Tao Bistro is really just mediocre Asian fusion food and not worth the money. 

Now onto the incompetent service. The group was kept waiting for almost 2 hours for the table service because the hostess could not match the package deal to the credit card on file without having the actual credit card that made the purchase. The entire dinner/club packaged was already paid for and yet there was a problem? Because of the wait, our group just cancelled the table service. That kind of service is unacceptable. At the very least, because of the incompetence, our dinner was reduced in price. 

Most people in the group were only in Vegas for one night, specifically to be at Tao, and Tao ruined this experience especially for the future bride and groom. Honestly I thought my second experience would be better. 

Ironically, for a club Tao is a buzzkill. 

Tao, see you never!After my horrendous experience here I would NEVER want to go back nor would I EVER pay for the crappy ass service presented here. I am highly allergic to seafood and so I saw this label stating "chicken" but when I saw the entree itself it looked like salmon so I wanted to be sure and I was RIGHT. So when I asked the lady behind the counter she goes "its salmon" so I ask so then where is the chicken and it states chicken. So then she rudely replies "DIDNT I JUST SAY ITS SALMON?!" and then says to me"THERE IS NO CHICKEN....NOW DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR ME" So I said NO and quickly went to the manager and told her the situation and the best thing done was that the labels were rearranged but as far as that bitchy waitress or server, she was never handled. F%ckin ridiculous is if you ask me! NEVER NEVER NEVER again! DONT BOTHER COMING. As far the food goes the orange chicken tasted like literal oranges (gross) the drinks, even fountain drinks are served in wine glasses. Premade salad served in cups. I think their "cup happy" LOL this place was fckn hard to find within all of the caesars palace properties. It is so confusing. Anyways so we went to hell and back to find it.  The pesto tortellini very dry and lacking salt. The mashed potatoes were surprisingly good, the extra large stuffed ravioli was just OK. The little trays that are heated towards the wall are so annoying because the lid keeps fallin down while youre trying to get your food. Their labels dnt match their entrees even their desserts are served in mini shot glass sized cups. The apple crunch dessert is tasty. Strawberry shortcake is just okay. The chocolate pudding was good (liked the crunch on top) because it gave it some texture and they had this one dessert that looked like whipped cream who knows maybe it was! It tasted like a slab of whipped cream because it was so fluffy and light, hardly any flavor idk if its trying to be a whipped cheesecake but if so it was an epic fail.The white chocolate macadamia cookie really good BUT really hard lol not a fan of the chocolate chip cookie very dry and mediocre. Just because SOME of their desserts were tasty it doesnt reimburse the horrible experience and other food I had encountered hereMy wife ordered the Sea Bass and didnt care for it. The waiter took the dish back and then the owner came over to our table and berated my wife on why there was nothing wrong with the fish.

We never asked them to remove it from our bill, and they didnt. Being scolded by the establishment was not what we had in mind. 

Never again for this place ever!!!!The check in here is terrible. Realistically waited 30 min to check in. Only 1 counterdesk worker working.Great atmosphere fine service. Worst thanksgiving dinner shouldn't have trusted this resturant for a good thanksgiving dinner especially for the price!!After ordering a drink that tasted a little funny I returned to the bar and noticed a foul odor and several fruit flies. I looked around and noticed a health code violation.  Drinks were stacked on top of each other and gathering condensation. Trying to be discreet, I told the bartender. He looked at me like I was stupid. I then requested to speak to the manager- this is the kind of thing that will shut a place down! I explained the concern to the manager and he immediately began removing the stacks and agreed with the observation. He then proceeded to wash the glasses over again and place then properly without stacking. Glad they took note of an observation but why do the bar staff not know proper procedure? Yuck! Sorry I had a drink here!"Good for Groups"...NO!  We went there for a bachelorette party, with a reservation for 20 girls.  If a restaurant with a capacity of 98 people can't handle that type of party, they need to say it, not leave girls standing in a tight entrance for over 45 minutes!  They had called earlier in the day to confirm.  When it came time to seat us, they said they couldn't get the party sitting at our table to pay their bill.  You would think with a party of our size, they would make sure the table was ready and available.  When I asked the hostess and manager to get us some cocktails or appetizers while we waited-they brought out one glass of champagne total for 20 girls!!!  After being seated, it took another 30 minutes just to get water and after an hour we finally had some food coming out-how do you not have water and edamame waiting for the people when they have been so patient.  They were bringing the water glasses out 4 at a time!  Unreal.  At the end, on a thousand dollar bill, they tried comping $12 worth of edamame and calling it a day.  After we said something, they comped us one round of lemon drop shots to compensate.  The food was okay, but not worth the service.   Customer service is a huge part of the found industry-they are selling a service as well as a product and it just seemed as though the management could care less. The best was at the end, they explained we waited so long because "they don't take reservations."  That is funny because THEY called US earlier in the day to confirm the time!!!Well how do I start?....First off The Pool...  a great complex ....BUT.... unless your there after March 7th DON"T expect any pool services....we checked in on Tues.  pool was great not many people weds okay but thur it was closed and we were sent to a different pool......ALL OF THEM ARE CAPABLE OF BEING OPEN..... a photo shoot..... Friday a beautiful day pool was packed....BUT.... not enough seating especially since the pool had many reserved seats enpty and tons of people sitting on concrete with plush seating reserved.......... We waited and got fine padded cots but I watched 2 dozen people come in and leave because NO SEATING.... to top that off  some people sat on the reserved seating anyway NO ROOM.... then security came by and said you must leave or PAY ....these are room guest to Mandalay Bay...... told to leave.... then in a conversation...the security guy told the people to leave or pay $400.00 a day and on Sat, $800.00 a day for a plush seat....?????? they moved but after the conversation the Pool security guy SLAPPED me on the shoulder and SAID you must not be a millionaire to and walked off..... The four seasons pool was empty and the Mandalay pool was jammed packed ........ I AM A WELL PAYING CUSTOMER AND I NOTICED THE STAFF WERE NOT THAT WELL PAYEDThis is the second worst show in Vegas( David Copperfield being the worst) 

There is about 5 minutes of entertainment in this show and the rest of it being a total gross out. 

My expectation were these blue people playing music and doing creative stunts instead you got totally gross out acts that I had to close my eyes to keep from throwing up. 

For example, they would eat cereal then spit the half eaten cereal at each other. Then they would stick a small thin camera in audience member's nose and mouth and display the results on a large screen. 

This gross out acts like do not appeal to you, then I would avoid this show at all cost. 

I hope this review will save some people from wasting their money and time on this show.This was the only shitty part of my otherwise excellent trip to Vegas. It was a rather cold night, and there was close to a 45 minute wait for a table inside, so my friend and I elected to sit outside on the heated patio.

It took 20 minutes (no exaggerating) before someone even came and took our order. She apologized and said the waiters were getting slammed and she came over to help out (we later found out that she was the bartender, and when she saw us not getting served, came out). She was the one bright spot in this shitty shitty experience.

Our actual waiter came out 5 minutes later (25 minutes on the game clock for those following) to take our order. Too late, buddy! A third waiter then brought us water.

Another 20 minutes went by (45 minutes now) and all of my sushi had come out, but my friend's chicken teriyaki hadn't arrived yet. I flagged down the lazy waiter and rather sternly asked him to track the dish down. It came out another 10 minutes later (55 min) without so much as an apology. 

The menu itself has more rolls with cream cheese on it than any self-respecting sushi place would allow. I got two of the few that didn't and a couple pieces of nigiri, totaling about $40. I ate $40 worth of grocery store grade sushi. And not a good, Asian grocery store, I'm talking about sushi from Ralph's or Safeway. It was terrible.

We ended up not tipping the rest of the wait staff at all for their shitty service, but gave the bartender a fat wad of cash and told her not to share.It was okay... we got the all you can eat sushi for $20. Limited sushi roll selection. Service was sub-par. 

Good thing my friends and I always have a good time. We were the only ones laughing so hard... 

The environment seems a bit snooty. And the manager or some guy in a suit came over to talk to us, and said that the crab roll was excellent. We ordered the crab roll before he said that, and it's IMITATION crab. Even my friend asked him if it was real crab, and the guy said yes... what a liar. Either he doesn't know SHIT about sushi or he was lying. I think it's that he doesn't know shit about sushi.

We just ended up eating the fish from the sushi and left the rice. LOL... 

Oh yeah, and the hostess was a bitch. There was a TON of free tables inside, and she was sweating us b/c we didn't have a reservation... what a c*nt. She didn't seat us until the owner of the restaurant got mad at her and she said "seat them!" in spanish. The hostess seemed european. hahaha.... I think it's because when you put two latinos, a black, guy and a filipino girl together - they probably figure you're not worth the time of day... which was exactly the vibe the 4 of us got... that hostess got what she was supposed to get.Never in my life as a paying customer have I been so offended by a bartender.   My wife and I stopped by IBAR at the Rio for a quick drink then some gambling.   I had half a beer left but was gonna need another one soon, so I wanted to order us both a drink.  We sat at the bar and noticed the bartender looking at me in a strange way.  I asked how he was doing and got no response, just a stare.  He asked me if I had seen the sign at the door, which I had not.  He explained the sign said "NO OUTSIDE DRINKS", had I been able to read it I would know.  His condescending tone, and implying that I am not able to read is completely unacceptable.  I simply stood up and told him that I am not going to give him my hard earned money so that he could insult me and my wife.  He said he didn't care and shrugged his shoulders all while keeping his condescending attitude.  We walked ourselves not only out of the bar, but left the RIO all entirely.  
I understand the policy of no outside drink, however the manner in which this bartender is enforcing it is unacceptable to any paying patron.  Had he approached me differently, I would have zero problem finishing my beer before going into the bar.  
Needless to say RIO will be boycotted during our visits to Las Vegas.  It's too bad because we always enjoyed visiting and staying there.  I hope this bartender understands that he represents the entire brand of the RIO not just the IBAR, and how his courtesies can completely make or break a customers experience.  


Sent from my iPadAbysmal service. A $100 bill for a bottle of wine, a plate of cheese, and two cappuccinos; and all that took 1 hour to even get. We were ignored for the most part, I'm very annoyed.One very, very blurry night a few months ago, I was showing an out of town friend around the Strip.  He wanted to go to a buffet in a bad way.  We were right by Harrah's, so against my better judgement, that's where we ended up.  Let's just say $22 a head was outragious for what was offered.

First, I was hungry.  Second, I wasn't expecting much, but thought I could eat just about everything.  Nothing looked appetizing to me, even through my beer goggles.  Everything looked old, the place was kind of depressing.  I wouldn't think anyone would really consider ending up here, but if for some reason you are - please think again.  There are better, cheaper buffets in town, I promise.Save your money. 
The crab legs were very mushy, and lacked flavor. The steamed vegetables were soggy. The sodas were flat. And rest of the food was just so so. 
The only positive thing was, they had cotton candy that you could take with you.
For $5 more you can go to a better dinner buffet.this wuz 1 of my favorite buffets in vegas... never again!!! my boyfriend and i got there around 7pm.  the wait in line wuz 2 hours long!!! ridiculous!!! everybody and their mothers wuz here.  the food wuzn't all that it used 2 b... since it wuz 9pm, they close @ 10pm, most of the dessers were gone!!! that's the main reason i go there.  maybe the sunday brunch is still good... who knows, and who cares now!!!Lack luster at best. Was seated right away so that was great. Review went down from there. Took ten minutes to put in a drink order and another ten minutes to recurve it. The food was nothing to write home about. I went simple and ordered a caprese salad. The tomatoes had no flavor and were just slopped on the plate.Umm, no thank you. This was definitely the worst eating experience I have had in Las Vegas. I ordered a club sandwich, which I understand is not their specialty, but I didn't have huge expectations. The sandwich was huge but not layered at all. Huge pile of turkey covered in bread, huge pile of bacon, wedge of iceberg lettuce. Basically ingredients that you have to assemble yourself. Oh and did I mention it cost $27. Ultimately had to complain to the manager about my disappointment.

Annnddd, my friend did get the pastrami which was also not very good.1 star, sadly because there are like 5 businesses in this whole center and LOTS O EMPTY ones.  

Wah Wah Wahhhhhhhh.

I'm going to give a nice yelp to Jillians though...I called to check for locals deal and was told I had to go to some zoo something or other.com site to buy locals tickets. This site did not have the MJ Immortal tickets so I went back to Mandalay site and bought my tickets through them (which brings you to ticketmaster). I got a mailer that stated local specials and had the MJ show which had no expiration date. I went to the ticket counter the night of the show and showed them my tickets and the mailer and explained what the lady on the phone said (that the site she sent me to did not have the MJ show but here is this mailer) the sales counter person told me the locals special ended on the 23 (I'm standing there on the 26) and that because I bought my tickets from ticketmaster (where Mandalay site sends you) and didn't call to buy (which I just explained thoroughly I DID) they would not do anything for me. I'm sorry but that is just very poor customer service if you send out a mailer you should honor it and your customer service phone people should know when your locals deals are available!!!!! Poor job Mandalay!!!!Wow, where to start. I would have hated this show even if it were free. I want the $100 and 75 minutes that I gave to this show back. 

Maybe 15 minutes total was an animal on stage. The rest of the time, it was goofy crap. The audience (which was only 1/3full) was so confused that there was hardly any clapping. 

Don't go! I wish I'd read the reviews first. The good reviews have to be written by the performers. There is absolutely no way people think this is even mediocre. I don't know how this show is running in Vegas. A total embarrassment. I'm sure Popovich is a nice guy who loves his animals, but this shouldn't be a show. My 4 month old puppy who just graduated from his puppy class could have done this stuff. I don't get it!The good: 
1) Nice location, particularly if you are staying at the MGM Grand or Signature.  If you're somewhere else on the strip it might be a bit farther though.
2) Friendly service
3) Nice decor -- it's more of a romantic place than maybe a place for a bunch of loud girls though
4) The french onion soup was fantastic, it came with the soup and instead of the cheese and crouton on top, it came with a grilled cheese sandwich.  Very nice touch.  Very tasty (although possibly too salty for some, perfect for me)
5) The lobster pot pie -- nice presentation, the crust was flaky and buttery, the lobster was tasty
6) I liked the chard that came with my meal!
7) The cheesy bread was my favorite part of the meal.  Which is actually really sad if you think about it.

The bad:
1) I ordered the pork, it was tough and very bland to me.  It was really disappointing
2) A friend ordered the short ribs -- she enjoyed them, I also thought they were really underwhelming.  Not tender, not flavorful.  They weren't awful, but pretty disappointing.
3) The lobster was sadly $85 -- but this might be worth it to some people.
4) Here's the most disappointing part for me -- we were offered still or sparking water, we took still.  What they didn't mention that it was bottled water and they were charging $8/bottle.


They apparently served us 5 bottles of water totaling $40 (this was for 6 people) which means adding on tip (18%) and tax (9%) meant we spent $50.8 on WATER.

Ok, that's not bad, that's ridiculous.
and it makes me feel very angry.  They talk about restaurants charging two or three times the cost of a bottle of wine -- well how about the 4-8 times for an all ready overly inflated cost of water?

The meal was way too expensive especially considering it wasn't that great and the fact that washing the proverbial bad taste was a significant cost.

We aren't in China or Switzerland.  You ask your patrons if they would like bottled or tap water -- 

terrible experience.
not going there again.Sorry fellow Yelp Elites, but this Yelper was underwhelmed by Michael Mina's establishment.  Perhaps it is just an extension of the MGM (see separate reviews)... didn't score a touchdown with Hubby and me.  We noted that many of the restaurants in the casino appeared either empty or closed.  When we came out of our concert at 10:45pm, all the restaurants were closed off and dark.  Seems that restaurants over at Caesars or Wynn stay open much later.

Since we were going to see Neil Diamond and didn't want to fall asleep during the concert from a huge dinner, we chose to go with nothing but appetizers.  One glass of wine for me and a Macallan 12 for Hubby.  Wanted to try the lobster pot pie, but thought it might be too heavy.  Anyway, what we chose were:

Caesar salad:  Six skimpy hearts of romaine heavily drenched in dressing with one itty-bitty, teeny-weeny sliver of an anchovy on top!  Oversized, dry, somewhat stale croutons, and two more dried out slices of cheese.

Roasted quail:  Like a good duck, quail should not be over-cooked.  However, we were not expecting quail sashimi!  Our grilled quail was a single split bird served on an overly sweet lemon sauce.  Very rare next to the bone.  

Foie gras:  Californians here having withdrawal, so had to order this.  The quarter inch thick slice was tasteless and over-cooked.   It came garnished with three clumps of red radish salad.  Ho-hum.

Pate:  The only item that we seemed to get right.  A generous serving of rustic pork pate.  Excellent with the wine.  Could have used more bread...actually, we saw other tables getting baskets of bread, but perhaps because we didn't order an entrée, it was not to be.

Service was mediocre.   We know it's Vegas, but for the prices charged, we expected much more.  Have never given such a low mark to a Vegas celebrity chef establishment, but the Nobhill Tavern just didn't make the grade.  We cannot recommend this place.Tiny portions and way bland food. Skip this one altogether.Please save your money from this resturant. The service is horrible. Took us forever just to get our nachos and when we got our pizza, we just lost our appetite. Our waiter took like 15 mins. just to refill our sodas. Their pizza isn't all that great. Nacho servings are enormous though. If you ever wander at hooters casino, just wait for a table at hooters resturant.A hair was found in my mouth attached to a Dan Dan noodle. We informed the waitress who denied it was one of theirs, my hair was in a bun all day so totally could not have been mine, and didn't even comp the dish. I couldn't eat after that and it ruined my entire experience and will not be going back ever!   Not worth your time even after the good reviews by others. Go somewhere else.Yuck....just yuck!

We went to this restaurant because it was next to the comedy show venue.  It looked like your typical touristy burger joint.

Unfortunately, the food was not even mediocre.

We ordered fries to come out first and they arrived as the side to one of the burgers.

The burgers were edible but flavorless.

The taco salad was COLD hamburger on top of a taco salad type bowl.  

Skip this place.  There are plenty of alternatives.If you eat pounds of meat at one sitting and don't mind if it's overcooked and dry, perhaps you might feel the price is right. However, our bill for two was nearly $80 and that's without alcohol. I also think that if you are going to periodically interrupt people's dining experience with half naked dancers and loud music, please upgrade your sound system. The Brazilian street music sounded like it was being pumped through the blown out speakers of a 80's Honda civic.

If your feeling carnivorous, your money is much better spent for a steak cooked correctly at a decent steakhouse.This is my 2nd time at Udupi Cafe, and I waited to write a review until a 2nd visit to be sure. The service here is lackluster, our waiter actually told us that "he only works here" and has no input into the chefs cooking when we asked him if we could not have all the vegetables in the mixed pakora platter. seriously? 

The food is mediocre, the pakoras are dry and tasteless, we had chile pakoras and there was no spice or creativity to them.

The dosa itself is good, the potatoes are very mushy and have minimal taste and their chutneys are not the best quality. 

I would recommend spending more time on working on their food  preparation and less time on the wait staff telling us that nothing can be changed. As a 100% indian, i would recommend Jewel of the Crown over this cafe in an instant.Let me just say that I've never been a fan of this mouse maze from the get go. Even though the furniture goes together with some relative ease, it still is something to be desired. My wife seems to like it though so this place gets one star becuase of her. Let me speak on their customer service and home delivery and installation for a moment though:

We purchased some cabinets to accent our living room and scheduled home delivery and install. We paid a pretty penny for that service, too. Let the customer beware, you go by their schedule and if you try to reschedule, forget it. They called me the morning of the day that they would be arriving and being the working man I am won't be home, nor will my wife to let them in or take delivery of the cabinets. If you need to reschdule and try and call them to reschedule, they won't. Once they're scheduled its a done deal. Customer service didn't offer any options and so the cabinets will left outside (then again who knows? I sure don't know what's going to happen at this point). And I paid nearly $200 for this? You have to be kidding me! No apologies, no options, no idea what is going to happen. 

I'm shaking my head. Thanks a lot IKEA, I'll never shop at your store ever again. You have no customer service and it was a waste of time and money to purchase your products and services that you left me in the dark on.Terrible.  Do not waste your time.  The entire "family" of restaurants (Naughty Gal, Cap Bills, Mariner's Inn) are all overrated, in fact poor.

If you think their "award winning" clam chowder is even palatable, you have never had good clam chowder.This *used* to be my favorite spot in Vegas, but Harrah's has completely ruined it over the past couple years.  Before it would have rated 5 stars easily... Now, if I could vote less than one star I would.  They used to have awesome cover bands, and djs.  When I went this time, the "cover band" only played a prepared set list, didn't take requests, and played the same pop music you hear in Every. Vegas. Club....   whack.

Finally the DJ came on.  He was doing ok until he kept shouting nonstop on the mic, and then started dancing on stage... and not well... They also cut down on the amount of flair bar-tending, and they also got rid of fire altogether.

Just to make sure that this wasn't an off night, I came back the following night and it was exactly the same band, playing exactly the same setlist, followed by the same DJ.  To add insult to injury, they've added go-go dancers, and a VIP area, firmly solidifying Carnival Court as just another spot that douchebags in Vegas go to hang out.  This is a grade-A, category 5 failure.  I do not recommend going.My boyfriend and I decided to try Cafe Bellagio for a small meal. The bread that comes out before the meal was just okay; nothing special. For our entree, we shared the organic chicken dish. The chicken was extremely dry! We had to ask for a side of sauce just to get it down. For dessert, we had the pineapple upside down cake. For about $10, the cake was extremely small. It wasn't even warm and the ice cream on top had melted, making the cake a big lump of mush.

All in all, I was very disappointed. I thought that with as fancy as the Bellagio is, it would have some decent food. But I was very, very wrong.The dim sum is mediocre but the prices were moderate.. We were seated right away but after that there was no customer service whatsoever.. We had to ask multiple times for someone to bring us water and tea, something that is usually done right away without being requested.. The ladies that walk around with push carts kept asking if we wanted anything but how are we supposed to eat when the basics haven't been covered yet? I have never received such lack luster service from a dim sum restaurant.. I would probably return again if they improved their waitstaff but the likelihood of that is not likely.. Sorry but you'll just have to try again, because for now you fail..After reading the description of this show, my friends and I were stoked to check this place out.  "Classic Burlesque" is what they stated.  All night until dawn was what they said..........

We show up, pay $30 a couple, and there is 1 go go dancer up on stage.  One was ok, the other girl was incredibly boring.  I though I was at a rave and some amature had stripped down to her underwear and starting dancing.

So after about 30 minutes of this, they announce the "world class burlesque show" will begin.  The first dancer arrived on stage.  She was OK, used a pole which is not classic burlesque.  She performed 2 numbers.  Then the band played until another dancer came out.  She performed and then it was over.  The whole show lasted 20 minutes and then the boring go go dancer came back out.

We honestly thought it was the worst Burlesque show we've ever seen.  The club was really uncomfortable, hard to see the dancers because it was so cramped.  The place does offer tables with 1 bottle starting at $280 but If I paid that, I would have left there screaming with disappointment...more than I already did.  

This place is a waste of time and money.  I would have rather lost $30 in slot machines than watch this "show" again.  DON'T GO!  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME!!  I wish I could give this place 0 stars.  The pictures make the place look cute when in fact it pretty dingy and cramped.I probably shouldn't review PF Changs, but feel it's my civic duty to warn anyone who still believes this is "Chinese" food, it's fusion, pretty Americanized and for whatever reason, always gives me the runs. ALWAYS! It's probably me, and you would think I have learned my lesson, but I try every so often to see if my stomach can handle it and every time, PF Chang's you bastard, you beat me.This is the worst store in Las Vegas. They never have anything you need. If I could I would give them 0 stars I would. Their customer service is beyond poor and I am done ever shopping at this Vons. Someone from management needs to really pay attention and either care or someone needs to be reported.It is really sad that the quality for this buffett has dropped so much.  The first time I went was 6 years ago and had to wait for more than an hour for a table.  Back then it was totally worth it with high quality seafood and food. 
This time there was no line.  Price with tax was about $50 per person.  But the seafood was awful...  either bad quality seafood, overcooked and dry or just poor tasting food.  
I would pay more to have the quality they used to have but for what they are serving I would say $15 (And even if they charged $15, I still would not go back!!!).  Save your money and go somewhere else like Wicked Spoon.Did starbucks have a contest to find the slowest employees of the company, round em up and place them all here?!?!

I get that the prices are inflated because its an airport, but BECAUSE its an airport time is of the essence and if you are going to charge more lets not take 15 minutes to make an iced latte!! Sheeeeesh.My friend was in town and we wanted to go somewhere with a "scene," that simultaneously had good food.  Needless to say, Tao was not the right spot for us.  As for the "scene," Tao pretty much hits the mark.  It is a beautiful restaurant, dimly lit, and plenty of Las Vegas visitors looking for a good time.  As for the food, it was very mediocre.  I will not be returning.  On a busy Saturday night in Las Vegas without a reservation, we waited for our table for about 30 minutes.  Not bad, huh?  Well with the 40 bucks we tipped the hostess to get a table at all, I was expecting to be seated right away.  I want my 40 bucks back! Oh well, live and learn.  On to the food.  Between the two of us we split the chefs special roll, shrimp tempura roll, spicy yellowtail crunchy onion roll, lobster wontons, shishito peppers, vegetable brown fried rice, and edamame.  Sounds like a lot of food, but the portions are small.  This was definitely enough food for us though.  The sushi was really not impressive.  Yes, the fish is fresh, but unless you are ordering sashimi, it is still possible to get a bad roll.  Well, we got three.  The worst was the shrimp tempura roll.  So small! So bland! So boring! Come on, if you are going to list this a chefs speciality, it better be special.  The other two rolls were a little better, but both sitting on top of a heavy mayo sauce that did not taste good.  This is my pet peeve.  Leave off the heavy sauce people! Especially if it tastes like crap.  The lobster wontons were pretty decent, I could only eat one because they were rich, turn your stomach kind of rich- too saucy, too salty, too something.  I will say the vegetable brown fried rice was pretty good.  This "healthier" version of fried rice was packed with veggies and had a great flavor, the only downfall here is that it was served to us ice cold.  The best thing at this restaurant by far was the shishito peppers! I swear these should be on every asian restaurant menu.  I cant imagine it is too difficult to roast these bad boys up, but regardless, Tao did a good job here.  If you haven't tried these peppers before, please try them!  I wouldn't steer you in the wrong direction.  Anyway, I may come back to Tao for a drink, but as for food, I will take my sushi/ asian craving elsewhere.This is the place that I had sushi while I was in Vegas about a year ago that made me feel sick. Just stay away! Everything else seemed rather sub-par even though the selection was fairly large. Not much to say about this place, but...I rather just have a go at Todai instead of this shack. 

Save yourself some money and go somewhere else. It's not worth it.My cousin, husband and I came to this place because the Main Street Station buffet had a super long line.  Bad idea.  The service was terrible.  The waitress took forever and did not give a rat's a** that she did.  We all ordered the Choice Cut Ribeye Steak.  Huge mistake!  I got the teriyaki style and my cousin and husband got the cowboy broiled steaks.  You could definitely tell these were cheap steaks.  I mean seriously cheap like found dead on the road or something.  Terrible, terrible tasting!  And what teriyaki sauce??  I mean can't they just get it from the jar?  Ugh seriously one of the worst steaks we have ever tasted.  The baked potatao was bleh and the green beans were soft and mushy.  I guess I should have known when I seen the sour cream come in a packet.  I gave this place one star for the beer.  I got the High Roller Gold which was pretty good.Very cool, but there is a good reason for the one star. Read below...

Being that both my boyfriend and I are part of the medical community we are fascinated by the human body. These types of exhibits are an excellent way to understand what makes you tick! As far as this particular bodies exhibit it was okay. A bit boring compared to the original Body Worlds but pretty cool.  However, there was an older woman who works there wouldn't leave us alone. She kept going from room to room explaining something when we didn't ask for an explanation. Being that we probably knew more about the human body then she did, it was starting to annoy us. We just wanted the quiet so we could enjoy the exhibit and what was in front of us.

Also, about 6 years ago I visited the original Body Worlds. It was much more exciting and allowed viewers to see not only humans but animals as well. It was much more interactive and they showed you the entire process they go through to create one perfectly preserved body. Also they used many different races as well as both genders equally. This exhibit in the Luxor seems to be using mostly Asian men, and it made us suspicious of why.

(Reason for my one star review!) I did some research and found its possible these bodies are prisoners from China who were executed and were not given a choice in where they now "rest". I'm not someone who believes in an afterlife and so I don't exactly worry for the person who is being displayed because he doesn't know, however if he had living family who wanted him properly buried that should have been the families choice, not Chinas. China should not be profiting off of these people, they should be donated.  In the original Body Worlds every body is donated by people who wanted to be apart of the exhibit. Now knowing this I regret spending my money here and wouldn't return. I would rather spend my money with a reputable organization. 

Lastly, I think those who are pissed about these types of exhibits due to religious views because of unborn fetuses or people shouldn't see inside the human body in this manner really need to grow up. This is science related, keep your religious views to yourself. You don't see scientists and medical staff making a fuss over fictional religious stories being told in your church, do you?  No, because they respect the fact that you want to have a belief. So people who have an issue with this don't need to attend. So stop trying to ruin it for others!Do not eat here.  The pancakes were old and cold - just run awayTo all filipino food lovers. Do not go to cafe moda. First, the food is too salty and they don't give you enough. My friend had a birthday party here last night and it was the worst birthday she had. The server ROCKY was very rude and unprofessional, she yelled at the 51 year old birthday girl and threatened her.  She changed their agreement because she thought she could make more money. When we asked for the manager there wasn't one. 
So to all those people planning parties there get your money back and go somewhere else. You'll have a better time @ Dennys.This was the worst experience I have ever had at a resaurant.   After making a reservation and then having the reservation dishonored I was told by the manager that reservations are simply a "request" for a table and there was no guarantee that you would actually be seated.   Also, the food attempts to be up scale but, in fact, is very ordinary.   For example, I had the lasagna and it was served in a bowl with overcooked pasta and was very unpleasant.What has happened to Claim Jumper? wanted to stay close to home last night with all the rain happening so we decided on CJ. I haven't been in a little over 3 years but had no concerns because it is the Claim Jumper. when we arrived we got seated and noticed the dingy and dirty feel, our table had a sticky pieces of something on it. The menus were filthy( we should have walked out then). Our salads came and they were warm, soggy and were disgusting. I also noticed a couple other tables having similar issues with the food and wait staff. Our dinners came, and it was gross. The Grilled Mahi was the worse i had ever had, Hard as a rock, could not even cut it with the supplied table knife, the rice was cold and the veggies were hard and cold. The whiskey glazed chicken was a bit better but still no where near the quality that i remember with the Claim Jumper. So after $65.00 for 2 people, i will never go back again, so many other choices in Phoenix. A couple of other tables looked like they were having a worse go around than us. Did not even stay for dessert, that's how disgusted we were.  RIP Claim Jumper !!Had dinner for ladies night last evening and had the worst service ever; he had the audacity to add gratuity as he knew we all thought he was rude, inattentive and rude. He then double authorized all our cc's. Writing a letter to corporate today... What a joke!Decent ambience. Mediocre service. Terrible food. All the meat was overlooked and had no flavor. We ordered fajitas and fundido. They were inedible. I didn't even bother sending them back. Would not return - even if I was starvingThis is absolutely the worst Chinese food I have ever had the misfortune to come across. The Orange Chicken tastes like bar-b-que. The Won Ton soup is  bland, the beef is too tough, and though the Crab puffs are huge, they are way too sweet.  Also, I think they over charged me by roughly $5. Alas,  I'm was so hungry I just went with it.Poor quality food and little selection. Got a rude server! Don't waste your time here!!My husband and I have been coming here for years. Everytime we go on vacation to Las Vegas we always make a point to eat here. Recently we went here and will never be going back. The waitress and the female manager were extremely rude, and I found lipstick on my water glass after I had been drinking on it. I do not wear lipstick! Needless to say this made me sick to my stomach. I ask to speak with the manager and when she came over she tried to argue with me that the glass had gone through a dishwasher so it should be fine. Disgusting! This place went from awesome to awful. Not to mention the meat sampler that they are known four has gone downhill. My husband was extremely disappointed with the quality of the meat and the way it was cooked. Normally when we leave there he is raving about the meat... I do not recommend anyone wasting your money on this place.nope  over rated-- pretty restaurant  but it should bee it was empty when we went and sat at the sushi bar. had to ask for towels and it  didn't make sense that the chef  placed a paper order ticket on top of the fish  we thought it was a mistake that it just landed there  but every order she threw the ticket on the plate/fish.  we  had a piece and a roll and left  was still $50    save your money 
Go to TAO in the Palazzo/VenetianYes they do take reservations. but what if you are trying to make a reservation when they are closed? No live person answers the phone. I cant wait to hear back from somebody. This day and age, everything is done electronically because we all operate more efficiently that way. This place needs to get some kind of online reservations.STINGY!!!!  I was a customer in the store, bought dog food and supplies regularly.  I gave them a donation letter and asked if they would donate to our non-profit auction.  I went to check back and buy my $45 dog food and they initially said they only donate to pet causes. I was shocked that they would not help out a regular customer.  They gave me a $13 bag of dog treats.  The cheapest and most begruding donation I received, hands down.  Kodi's Natural Dog Foods donated a 50lb bag of dog food.  I am no longer a customer at Wag n Wash, too bad, I love to support local business.Food off the menu is pricey and not worth it! 

Dim Sum is horrible! Reheated in the microwave after a long rancid stay in the carts. 

This place used to be good 10 years ago, but I am so over it! Blech!I think the quality of food has declined recently and even got a little sick after eating there last time.  It's too bad because it used to be a great place!My BF and I were both super tired from walking around nonstop, and this was one of the few places that was cheap inside MGM.  

But like what all the other yelpers said, damn is this place OVERPRICED! We ordered a BLT and a Roast beef sandwich and it came out to like $22.  WTF?!  It tasted alright, but for that hefty pricetag I think otherwise.  NEVER COMING BACK.  

Please think before you order next time.  $10 for a basic sandwich is NOT the way to go.  You're better off eating a lunch buffet somewhere or just going to MCDs that's just right around the corner.Apparently the expensive all over lotion they sold me is suddenly harmful to my face and I need to buy a facial lotion. I was told today that the lotions they sell can cause your blood vessels to explode in your face so you need to buy their facial lotion too! Oh and tanning can age you so the facial lotion will help. They may be losing a client. Next time I will be told they have leg lotion on and on until I buy them all!This place is really having issues and it's crazy dirty.  The food has just plummeted, my sandwich had one little piece of steak on it, it was so pitiful, I was just speechless.  A friend of mine has severe allergies to cheese and soy, she told them this, and still put cheese on her salad.  I got a peek of the area where they prepare the food, it was a mess!  I was thinking twice about ordering, but I was starving and my friends were already eating.  I've seen cleaner bathrooms at truck stops.  It's just disgusting!Thank you enterprise for ruining my day.  What should've been a simple transaction turned into a 45 minute nightmare where my husband and I were interrogated and made to feel like criminals.  I've been renting from enterprise on and off for quite some time.  Almost 5 years now I've been renting for vacations, family emergencies, car accidents, and as of late, basic transportation till I can afford a new vehicle to get to and from work.  But no, today you have lost a very loyal customer because being told, "it's not personal," repeatedly while looking at me and my husband disdainfully does not sit well with us.

Neither is an exceptionally rude staff member who boasts of being in the company for 3 years yet questioning her upper management while out at lunch.  "Well I don't know how they used to do things but they are not here right now and I am just doing my job."  All you are doing is pissing people off by your callous attitude. 

Finally after verifying insurance, addresses, blood type, etc my husband was asked to sign the papers.  Again, more rudeness by her mannerisms and overall attitude and after everything still saying, "I'm just doing my job."  All I could say without imploding is that I didn't want to talk about it anymore and that I wanted to just get on with it.  

After checking the car, which was not properly cleaned, we were given the car.  I was not offered insurance through enterprise, I was not told the amount of gas in the car, and I was basically shooed away because we were done with.


Customer service, whether it be a a store, a rental place, a restaurant, is a big thing for me.  In my book, you can get away with a lot by just being cordial and having a smile.  Even when things are difficult keeping an upbeat attitude can go for miles.  What I experienced today was a shrew of a woman who didn't know how to handle anything with any kind of decorum.  We were made to feel like we were criminals trying to steal a car or something.

This is my last time going to enterprise.  You have lost my business, my respect, and my reference to all business and family associates I have to come to our destination city.  I would rather have my people take bus than deal with judgmental people who treat repeat customers with such behavior.  Again, I kept my cool as long as I could.  I am amazed I did not start screaming.Inexpensive crap that doesn't work half the time. I have given up on Frys, but was in town for a tradeshow and desperately needed an adapter. Only option was Frys... they had the adapter, got it back to the tradeshow, and, of course, it doesn't work. This has been my experience over and over again with Frys and once again they lived down to expectations. Sign up for Amazon Prime and just buy everything through Amazon... at least their stuff works as advertised.Love Einsteins but do not love this location.  Employees are a bit scary and the food prep area appears dirty.  Won't come back.  Wish they could get some help.Quality of food seems to have changed, I used to really enjoy going here but now it seems there are better options out there. Service also is lacking I would rather go to a place where I don't feel like I'm bothering them just to get waited on.Pictures definitely don't accurately represent the resort.   Its dated, in need of maintenance, and pretty much as far from "luxury" as you can get.    Its basically a semi-glorified Motel 6 with a decent pool.    If you're looking for a place for the kids to splash around for the day OR on spring break this may work for you but beyond that  MOVE ON!!

We had two rooms and they both had a musty smell and had old crappy balconies - nothing like the one in the picture.   The building paint is chipping, the fountains are non-working/broken and in desperate need of repair. 

The pool area is so overcrowded its next to impossible to get a lounge away from the two billion screaming kids in the pool.     The kids area (the only place left by noon)  has the old style pool lounges that are sun bleached and worn out with the old rubber strapping.  

We had the party gang on the second floor across the way that had 12-15 people sharing 2 rooms.   They kept the door open for the ongoing celebration between the rooms - all of them trashed and obnoxiously loud.  We called security twice before they did anything and the front desk girl was a total B*TCH when I called back the second time.   

I hate this place.   I will never go back and can't wait to get this experience out of my memory.Being a Vegas local, I would recommend to go else where.  I had had the impression that Ceasar's was one of the premier resorts on the Strip and I found this to be incorrect.

I had a conference this past weekend at Ceasar's and had a room in the Roman Tower.  I am aware that Ceasar's had recently built a new tower, but in my opinion, they should have spent the capital upgrading the original towers.  The room was nice enough, but I have been in Comfort Suites that were nicer.  There was mold in the shower and hair on shower walls and ceiling.

The first night, I froze in my room.  The second night, I turned up the thermostat to find that the vent was only blowing cold air.  I placed a call to Front Desk and a serviceman called upon my room 90 minutes later (around midnight, when I had a 7:30am meeting the next day for my conference.)  The on the second night, the electrical breaker blew in my room and I, temporarily, had no electricity in my bathroom.Avoid at all costs - found chewed up bubblegum in the food

We found chewed up bubblegum in our food during lunch buffet.  What is worse is that the manager refused to throw out the dish from the buffet and replace the contents.  People, this is a bad sign since they are willing to cut corners and worse to save a few bucks.  
Anyways why would they spit out gum into the food?  This is so gross!  I will not go there again since I am sure that they really don't give a damn about their customer's health and would rather have us get sick than waste a couple of bucks.Somewhere between the movie Beetlejuice and the crap flung around a crack whore's apartment lies Curiouser and Curiouser - the retail incarnation of schizophrenia. 

Avoid this dump and its insane owner like the plague.Why bother having an automated postage kiosk when you're not open beyond normal post office hours?

Nearest 24/hr Post Office is 5 miles away, on Struck... Nice. I feel bad for anyone that has a PO box here; good luck checking your mail after hours or on weekends...I came here after reading the reviews on yelp, you guys let me down.  :(  

I'm fine with eating at most hole-in-the-wall dirty restaurants but this one was a too much.  First the tables reeked of wet-rag/mildew, which I normally I  would just tolerate but this time it created a progressive effect.  I'll just get to the point, the man that took our order/delivered our food/took our money, had bits of rare beef on his fingertips.  dood.

end of story.  i don't care if the broth is heavenly, the beef buttery, or it's free.  if that man doesn't at least WIPE his hands with the stinky mildew rag after making the bowls i don't want to think about what else he does or doesn't do.

i almost couldn't keep my soup down.  gag.  beef bits aside, if anyone is still interested in visiting, the broth was mediocre, the beef low quality and low in quantity.  go down spring mountain road a few more miles and take your chances on another pho places, seriously.Whopper was dry. Fries were cold. Iced tea was flavorless.

There was also a creepy old lady just sitting in there talking to everyone as they walked by. I didn't respond to her and she proceeded to stare at me the whole time I was sitting there. She also went over to a family with a little boy to tell them "he's so cute I just want to snatch him up and take him away with me". Um, okay. If I was that boy's parents I'd have gotten out of there as fast as I could.

Management: do us a favor and make the creepy people leave the place if they're not there to eat. Thank you.This was the worst "hotel" or motel I have ever stayed at!!! I sincerely hope no one stays here ever again!! We could here everything I neighbors said and did, including them hocking loogies!! We demanded our money back and 1 MONTH later finally got refunded! this place is a DIVE and they steal your money =( I agree, this place deserves ZERO stars!!The one-star review says next to it: "Eek! Methinks not."
Indeed. Could we take that and multiply that to infinity?
I have had Cox service since 2003. I have continuously had ongoing issues with my internet- it sucks. They've been out a ton of times over the years and I have actually had probably 70 or more occasions to call and complain about something. 
Currently, it's cable TV.

I have been noticing the past month or so that they are overlapping commercials to cut off programming mid-sentence and then coming back with dialogue already in progress. I didn't know who to blame for the longest time, but as an experiment a friend and I both DVR'd the same show. She has Direct TV. She did NOT have the overlap, and I timed it to be over a minute missing. 

So the guilty culprit is COX, who, after calling and talking to an IDIOT who tried to pass the buck "It's not our fault. Cox is told how many minutes of commercials they can buy, blah blah blah."  Wrongo. They are buying so much time and then running commercials under the guise of being, say 1 minute, when in reality they are 1.5 minutes or more. 

It has gotten ridiculous and I'm about to cancel ALL my Cox (sucking) accounts - cable, internet, phone (which also sucks.)
I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!!Ordered cox bundle service for $ 149.00 for 2 years. TV, internet, Phone.
I live in a section of Las Vegas that Cox has not updated their system for over 10 years.
I need constant internet service. Work from home. Cox said I would receive 10 mb of speed.
2nd day no internet, so when the internet goes down so does your phone service.
So now I am on hold for 3 hours using my cell phone minutes to speak to someone about no internet. 
Cox sends out a repair man, changes a bunch of wires, leaves.
Internet service works for 2 hours, down again.
On hold for 2 hours, Cox sends out a second repair man.
Second repair man, changes modem box, checks wires, says they need to change out outside wiring, puts in order to do so.
Repair never came.
Now I am dealing with intermitten internet service for the next 3 weeks.
Called a total of 5 times, with hold times total 10 hours.
Now first bill arrives $ 271.87.
Charged me for long distance calls that I was told when I signed up would be free.
Due to no constant internet service, I have no choice but to cancel service.
Just received my final bill with a $ 220 early termination fee.
This has been the worst experience I have ever had with a company.
Total ripoff.
Please be aware of this company. Stay far awayI just couldnt take it any longer! What a waste of time and money to just try and use their services (extremely, painfully slow internet) overpriced cable with a billion channels and nothing I WANT to watch - tons of garbage filler channels that you HAVE to wade through to find something good, and then when the crappy product goes from painful to use to not working at all you get the EXACT SAME results from their customer service!  Painfully slow, cant find anyone who can actually help with the problem, and unexpected charges for everything!

I finally cancelled the whole thing because it was just as useful unplugged and in a box in the garage!  After another excruciating experience just TRYING TO CANCEL! I move on thinking it's all in the past and I wont have to deal with them again.  BUT, that's when the deluge of offers in the mail come in wanting me back, touting their awesome service, incredible prices, and happy customers! Really? 

Then I start getting calls wanting me back. This time the people are quite friendly even though I'm irritated and dump on them about how they failed over and over before they lost my business.  Still they keep calling and are quite pleasant.  Then it occurs to me... this is where they put all of their good people - on the phones trying to get pissed of customers back!

Too little, too late.  I'm extremely happy without all of the frustration.  Now I just use my iPad and stream a movie from Netflix now and then if I want to.  Much better, cheaper, and i don't have to deal with people that makes my head want to explode!Was packing up my house in south Phoenix I was selling when I was approached by a salesman named Eric.
Eric seemed nice, professional and honest about getting me to sign up for a bundle package when I moved into my house.

Eric sold me on a bundle package that he said would be 109.99 plus tax- a monthly bill that would be no higher than 116.00.
"Price lock guarantee"

Eric also gave me a $200 visa gift card, free hbo and starz for the life of the 2 year contract... All I needed to do was sign up that day.

I gave him all my information- and told him I would give him a call when it became closer to me moving into my house.

A couple days later I received a phone call from a install rep saying he was at my door to install the cox services... I told him I wasn't even moved into the house yet and I would call when I was moved in to set up service.

I received a call about 2 times a week with install reps at my house that I haven't even moved into yet. (Frustrating)

Eric called me after two weeks of me signing up and said he had a NEW better promotion he was going to apply to my account. Only this promotion was 10 bucks cheaper! 99.99 he said... I was excited to get such a good deal.

Moved into my place- got the install- FINALLY.. Only 2 days after I received my first bill..
145.58


145.58 is not 99.99 or anything close to that.


Called customer service and the rep was less than helpful and insulted me when I told him I had a signed piece of paper saying 109.99 plus tax right in front of me- and that Eric had told me 99.99 two weeks later and added me to a different promotion.
He stated that the 99.99 promotion was not active anymore and hasn't been for a while. He began breaking down my account balance and stating service charges, fees and extras.... 

He also told me I couldn't cancel my account because it had been past the 30 day grace period of canceling the account when I had only had services for less than a week.

I called Eric to see what he had to say about this whole situation and he kind of danced around the whole bill and stated he would get it all resolved shortly and get back to me....

Been two weeks Eric... Nothing!?!

I would like this issue resolved- I know cox has better customer service than this.
If I knew the service was going to be almost 150.00 a month I would've bundled with dish network or even centurylink. That's why I signed up for 99.99.Last week, I had my 2013 Corvette hand washed at this location. But one of young men who was an attendant was wearing a knife on his belt and as he exited my car, the knife cut into my leather interior and the knife itself, was left in the car. When I brought the matter to the attention of the personnel they shrugged it off suggesting that the tear was merely wear and tear on my "old" Corvette. I took it back yesterday to speak to a manager who did precisely the same thing. He suggested the employees were not permitted to carry such weapons on their person but, this employee did in fact have a very menacing looking knife clipped to his left hip. I mean who ever heard of an employee not following the rules, right?? So the moral of this story is...make sure you take photos of your car before you go to this car wash because if one of their employees is responsible for damaging your car and you do no have a video of them doing so, you are just out of luck. 
This incident suggests to me that Cobblestone will not take any responsibility for the damage they inflict on your car. So fellow consumers...BUYER BEWARE!!DO NOT even try this garbage business.  Dropped my car off for the works wash and they didn't touch the inside at all.  When I let them know, they took no accountability and just said "oh" in response.  Left the car there and got back the 2nd time with the mats all over the seats and still no interior cleaning.  Unbelievable!Even as bike shops go, this place is terrible. I wanted to fix an old bike for my girlfriend.  They said they could turn it around in one week... one week became two and a half weeks.  Didn't bother contacting me.  When I got the bike back, it was still dirty, they failed to replace the breaks, cables, and cable housings.  Shotty work, when I tested the breaks and the gears, they lost all tension because screws were not tightened.  I thought I could take the easy route and not rebuild the bike myself.. now I'm out money and I have a bigger project than before.  Thanks Paragon!garbage!!!I've been here a few times. I keep wanna to give them a shot but my  experience the other night will be my last. I've gone back because I've never had a horrible experience until Friday night. The server was not very good. We had to ask on several occasions to bring us our drinks or silverware and napkins. We waited for our food for about 45 minutes. When we finally received or food it was cold and mushy. My tamlae tasted like i was eating bread not masa and my taco was mush. The salsa was very very bland. I had to add some salt to give it at least some kind of taste. I understand if the restaurant is busy but you still need to have good service and food good enough or at least warm enough to want to eat. I will not be eating here again and would rather drive into town to get Mexican food. Very disappointing. So much that we're still talking about how awful it was.Worst place ever! I did not stop in fast food places in ages. Decided to use restroom after shopping & get quesadilla . Girl was cleaning floor then smashed her nose , cleaned with her pants, then decided to take order..... I asked her to wash her hands first. She said Oh yeah, & went to restroom . Later took my order, just one quesadilla .... I had to wait it for 11-12 minutes.... Really? 
Fast food????? Easier to stop in restaurant ! Place is sooooo dirty! Trash over filled .... I thru away quesadilla but left just a coke to drink...... Yucky!!!!I was referred to this office by a coworker who just raved of this place.  When I got there the receptionist was on a personal call and neglected me for about 5 minutes.  Then, what appeared to be the great grandmother that runs the place came out she scolded the receptionist right in front of me.  They finally gave me the paperwork and I started completing it.  20 minutes later my exam started which was very thorough.  Without asking me, they took my contacts and "polished" them for a $20 charge.  I was PISSED!  After the exam they tried to sell me new  frames HARDCORE.  Their selection is very boring, overpriced, and unorganized.  I decided to keep my own frames and just get new lenses, which I got lots of attitude for.  Two and a half weeks later I got a call that my frames arrived and I asked if I could send someone to pick up my glasses since I was on a tight work schedule.  They said okay.  FOUR TIMES I had my friend drop by, each time spending 20 minutes waiting to pick them up.  My glasses turned out well but the experience was AWFUL and I don't recommend going here at ALL.  I'll continue to search for what seems to be the non-existent good optometrist...I have a lengthy history with this location but my last visit was bad enough not to return.  After having my brake lines flushed, the brake indicator light was on.  The mechanic claimed it was on when he pulled into the shop (it wasn't; I should know since I drive it every day).  They admitted the process can damage the internal float mechanism but they are unwilling to fix the problem they caused.  Even corporate ignored my plea.  The mechanic offered to disconnect the wire that turns on the dash light.  ?!?!  I'm surprised he didn't offer to put electrical tape over my dash light.  On top of all that, I had to clean the grease off my steering wheel when I got home and the waiting room smelled like cig smoke.  A bad experience through and through!If it was not for my home warranty company, I would not be working with Reliable Repair and in current and future home warranty claims I have asked not to work with reliable repair. Since Thanksgiving, my microwave has stopped working. The claim was put in a few days after Thanksgiving and when requesting an appointment time they fail to realize that the average American WORKS! They say they will call the day before with the window of time they will come. THE WINDOW is 4 HOURS! Then when they do come, they can't fix it right then and there, so I have to schedule another 4 HOUR window when I can take off work. So, the 4 hour window where I take off and they come to my house with the wrong piece so the microwave is still not fixed. No apology for the inconvenience. They order the "new" part and ten days pass and still no call from them so I reach out and they say that the wrong part came in again. Now we are mid January and I have to find time to take off another 4 hour window when they can come by with hopefully the correct part. They don't ONCE apologize for the inconvenience or are even remotely close to working with me on an appointment time. I thought this may be the way repair companies work, but when I called C & J repair to come out on my garbage disposal, he was friendly and kind. When he suggested a time he could come, I said unfortunately I can't, I work at that time, so he worked it out where they came on a SATURDAY!!!! C & J repair is who I will call every time.  I can't wait to be done with RELIABLE REPAIR, I would call it "unreliable repair." Save yourself a hassle with unfriendly and inefficient people WITH ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!By far the worst apartment complex in Phoenix. If you are looking to rent here DON'T. The gates haven't worked since June  of 2012. I received a letter on my door saying that the gates will be fixed by may 7th 2013. It is currently June 16th and the gates are still not fixed. They advertise pool side televisions but when you go to use them they are all disconnected and not working. I have been calling maintenance at lease every week on my dishwasher because it doesn't clean the dishes at all it actually makes them dirtier. They have came out literally 5 times and said everything was fine. I was so pissed I ran the dishwasher again and actually took pictures of my dishes after the cycle and brought it down to management. They told me they will have maintenance look into that and replace my dishwasher. I then get another notice 2 days later saying that my dishwasher was working fine and was no need to replace it. I was so furious I felt like talking to management was like talking to a brick wall. There is dog shit everywhere and trash is always over flowing. They say they have spas in all their pool locations. But there is only 1 of those spas that actually has spa water in it. The rest of the spas are pool temperatures which is pretty damn cold in the winter. All in all don't rent here. But if these post didn't scare u away. Please take my lease over I won't even charge you a security deposit.Let's get this out of the way first - the food was OK, but just OK.   At best, it gets 2 stars.  Mexican food for gringos.
What was really awful horrible heinous was the service.   The evening started out well enough.  The hostess said the wait for a table would be 15 minutes.  We went to the bar and ordered margaritas (the upgrade from the house one).   Before the bartender finished making the drinks, the hostess came to take us to our table and said she would have our server get the drinks.  We were quickly served chips and dips.
This is when things fell apart. 
It took at least 15 minutes to get the Margaritas.  However, they were really delicious!
The waiter did not come back to take our order for another 15 - 20 minutes.  It took at least another 30 minutes to bring the food (soup and an appetizer plate).  During this wait, a different waiter came to take our order and a kitchen person tried to give us the food that belonged to another table.  When we did get our order, it had errors - my husband was given a cup of soup although he ordered a bowl and the guacamole never arrived at all.
During all of these waits, the bus boys continuously asked if we needed anything but seemed powerless to do anything other than bring more chips.  We ordered a second round of drinks and these took even longer to get.  When we did get them, they were not what we ordered.  When the correction was made, they were so tart they were undrinkable.
Our server apologized profusely because he knew he provided poor service, but honestly, I don't think he was the problem.  He seemed to be stressed and running all the time.  There seems to be a serious lack of organization and training in general.
I see the reviews for Serranos are mixed.  We know we won't be going back anytime soon.Probably the WORST branch I have ever been in. Average employee IQ must be in the single digits. Ugh!Customer service is awful and that is being kind.  Recently tried to stop in a buy some pool acid and was told they were too busy to help me so I took my business elsewhere.  The service clerk could not have been more rude if he tried.  Avoid this business at all costs unless you want to be treated like you are pond scum.I am not able to rate on full rating because I will not  be able to see a finished product .....but that is because the Flower Studio was not willing to work with my fiance and I on the pricing that they offered.  The initially quoted almost 9k which included charges from some random things.  I traded calls and emails with them trying to work out pricing and work with them on their budget to match our budget.  Shrinking down what we wanted for flowers, etc. After it was all said and done it was sent via email that they will not budge on their pricing and basically that they are too good at what they do for our services/budget. I was very shocked to hear a business not want to make money.  Your loss Flower Studio because we have many, many contacts and friends who work in the hospitality industry and are planning weddings.Will never rent from dollar rent a car again. The service at the counter was very slow. When we finally got the car, the gas tank was half empty! We had to ask to get it topped off, which delayed us even more. 

Upon returning the car, keep your gas receipt and present it! They charge a ridiculous amount for their gas. The attendant was thankful we had the receipt. I feel that this is an unusual practice for car rental.

Also the charge for their OPTIONAL car insurance is $26.99 a day and Roadsafe service is $5.99 a day. This adds up quickly. They do not tell you these items are optional, nor are they upfront about how much they charge a day. For my three day rental this tacked on an extra $130, with other minor fees (e.g. State tax, etc.)! This is on top of my original reservation fee! 

I have never paid this much to rent a car!Will not go back, ever.  The trouble started when I booked the appt.  I didn't want to give my address to join the mailing list, this was apparently was a huge issue.  It should not EVER take 20 minutes to book an eyebrow wax appt.  Then I arrive 5 minutes early for a 1:00 and the women I had the appt with, Grace,  wasn't even there yet.  She finally arrived 5 minutes late and had to set up the room, this leads to another 5 minutes.  I had someplace else to be so finally I left.  Totally ridiculous.  If I had been 10 minutes late it would have been a big issue.  Real sick of a total lack of customer service around town lately!I love Sonic.  I grew up eating frito pies and cherry limeades.  Now, I'm addicted to the Java Chillers.  BUT my enjoyment of Sonic has taken a huge hit lately.  The reason is the slow, unprofessional, unfriendly service that seems to be the norm at this location.  This Sonic is very close to my house, so I have tried multiple times to give them the benefit of doubt - maybe they are understaffed and that's why it takes so long to get orders out? (No, there are always kids running every which way when I get to the window)  Maybe the person was having a bad day? (No, I have yet, after probably 20 visits, to receive a "Thank you" from ANYONE)  This place is just managed terribly.  It's too bad that this one store can ruin such a great experience for so many people.  Get it together, Williams Field!!!Ate here last night, just about finished my dinner when a roach crawled on my table. DirtyI had initially decided upon Maxim as our driver provider for a special night out for a birthday night due to price and availability.  It was a simple drop off/ pick up.  I had reserved the service with a credit card number which I was assured would not be run, and to just let the driver know how I wished to pay.  I understand having a credit card on file for a service like this to ensure payment.  However, a few weeks after the occasion, my credit card statement came in which showed it had been run not once, but twice.  Once for the drop off, and again for the pick up.  I called and explained the situation and was told the driver who drove us that night was no longer in their employment, and they would need to confirm that we did in fact pay cash and that somebody would get back to me.  A week or so later, I called again to inquire about the status of the refund, and was told they would refund me for the charges, and they apologized for the delay.  I was refunded once of the charges within a week, this was in the beginning of October, it is now January 28th, and after five more calls in to the accounting department, and two emails, I have yet to receive a call back, a voice mail, or email to let me know that they are at least addressing their accounting slip up.  It's a minimal amount, but it has cost me all of my patience and I am amazed that a company of this size doesn't have the customer service comprehension to promptly fix their own errors, and communicate with a client immediately.  I would not recommend this service to anyone who values customer service, or professional follow-through.  I will be filing a complaint with the BBB, as well as disputing  their final charge on my credit card.  This all could have been avoided with a quick and simple call to inform me of where they were at.  Due to the fact it has been hours our of phone time since October, I will put just as much, if not more energy into ensuring the truth about their shortcomings are public.This was such a sad experience. I used to like Dominos a lot. Since there "new pizza" has come along, I will not order again. My boyfriend who will eat almost anything...especially pizza, stopped after 1 piece and said it was disgusting. He HATED the cornmeal all over the bottom of the pizza. He said that it was gross and annoying having it all over his hands while he ate. He also did not like the garlic crust. I like the flavors of the crust because they taste like their breadsticks, but did not like having to touch it the whole time I was eating the pizza. The cheese was sparce, and the pizza way dry. I babysit a little girl all the time, and Dominos was her favorite, and now she won't eat it at all. I also think that it was rude how they put "Papa Johns, now who's your Daddy" on our pizza box. First of all, Papa Johns is my favorite fast food pizza. I think it's funny that Dominos has had to copy them with garlic sauce, and now they are trying to claim that their new pizza is better. yeah right. Dream on Dominos! Never again!lousy!  rude but most importantly she butchered my pants!  DO NOT USEPurchased a Groupon offer with these folks. They no showed when the appointment was scheduled and had some message on their phone saying that there was a 'technical' glitch and they lost all of the information.

Funny since I got an email on Saturday from Groupon confirming my appointment.

I smell a rat. Company did a deal with Groupon and could not handle the volume and made up some lame excuse to get out of it.

Honorable company would say "Leave your name and number and we will call you within 24 hours to take care of mistake"...not call them and see if you can get a refund.

Or how about this....ANSWER YOUR PHONE and don't hide behind a voice mail.I've had the pleasure of using this facilty since it was built, and had I rated it on any of my past visits, it would have gotten 5 stars like many of the reviews you'll find here.
Unfortunately, this is not the same Mayo Hospital as 2010 or earlier.
Mayo, like every other business entity in today's economic environment is now demonstrating a particular focus on bottom line rather than patient care. I experienced this first hand last week during a two day procedure.
Inquisitive, I asked several staff members what was going on, since the level of service had deteriorated so noticeably. I got the same response from nearly all I spoke with. 
Mayo, in its efforts to fill all the beds has now started accepting most insurances, (a concept they turned their nose up at in the past) the result of which is an overly crowded hospital. 
Due to the nature of my procedure, I was to stay overnight. I stayed overnight, but in a holding area instead of a room. Again, the nurses informed me there were simply no rooms available. 
The result.
Both my wife and my doctor were unable to locate me. 
The nurses were not helpful and willfully disregarded the printed instructions given to my wife at check-in, (stating visiting procedures post-op).
After several (4) hours of my frantic spouse trying to locate me, she finally was told she could not see me due to my not being accessible.
My doctor was unable to locate me until 5 hours after the surgery at which time he blew up at the staff, (in my presence) informing them a room was necessary due to the extensive neurological testing required the next morning and how this could not be performed in a holding area. 
The next day when I did come around, I found a nice bump on my head along with a nice cut on my face. I informed the nurse on duty but she deferred to the patient care rep who blew it off as a routine condition that regularly occurs in surgery, telling me the surgery table was cold and my head likely stuck to it. (like that explains the goose egg and cut)

The doctor was the best. The nursing staff was also top notch. It was the overcrowding, the panic they managed to instill in my family by not keeping them informed post operatively, and the dumb as hell patient rep whose ardent defense of the hospital only made her look stupid, and me contemptuous.

The Mayo has always been a top notch facility, but this visit proved anything but. 
When you charge the prices the Mayo does, there's no excuse for the troubles we experienced.
I, like the other reviewers, routinely recommended the Mayo as being the standard in ultimate patient care.
Not anymore.
I could have gotten this level of disappointment at the County Hospital.I love buffets. I go to many. So my one star is for the quality of the food here. My friend and I wanted to try a new Chinese buffet and headed over here for our first try.  All the meats tasted nasty. I spit out over half the things I put in my mouth. I ended up not eating a lot of each plate I tried. I am easily pleased usually, but this place really wasn't good. They had tons of variety but the quality was lacking. I would say their best items were their hot and sour soup and their dessert bar. I would not go back.What a waste. Place looks like a cool spot for breakfast, but that was it. There were about 4 tables, and 2 waitresses, and they waited like 15+ minutes before even asking us if we wanted a menu. They did however stare at us several times, yet never making the jump to offer us anything. After we took a menu from the table next to us that finished, we finally got to order. Once the food came, it took another 5 minutes to get silverware. Non-fresh squeezed OJ(Big letdown!), and food was terrible. I had the breakfast burrito and my tortilla shell was stale. My sisters goat cheese omelet was rancid, and my other sisters scrambled eggs had a very weird taste to them(unedible). Only meal that didn't get too many complaints was the over easy eggs, except the yolk was cooked. 

The weird thing was that the neighboring table's food looked so much better than ours. I don't understand, because we werent raudy or disrespectful or anything. We paid our bill, and left, and will never be back. Shame, because of the cool setting. Don't waste your money on overpriced breakfast!Terrible experience here. First, I was stabbed in the gum with the sonic cleaner device when the dentist wedged it between my tooth and gum. I literally yelped in pain. Then the dentist spent the rest of the appointment telling me how much additional work I need (as if I am letting her anywhere near my mouth again) and surprise they already checked to see that my insurance will pay for it...I'm going back to my old Dentist.We came to South Point to see the Spazmatics. While eating in the buffet before the show, I began to notice that there was a stronger smoke smell than I had experienced at more prominent casinos. After dinner, we wandered the gaming area and got in line for the show. That's when I became overwhelmed by the smoking. Jesus!  I guess they decided to cut a corner with air scrubbers, because within 20 minutes, I was sneezing and had an uncontrollable flow of sinus drainage. My best advice is to stay away from this place if you do not smoke. Consider yourself warned. Oh, the Spazmatics were great.Want a quick water cus its 108 outside? Sure. Tap water $1.00 didnt want to pay for tap water just a cup? .64 cents for a water cup.TERRIBLE!!!   I bought a weekend stay on groupon, when I called about booking a weekend every date I mentioned was "sold out", I finally had to settle for a date that I didn't really want in order to not lose the value of the groupon I already paid for.  When we got there to check in there was only one person working the desk, not only did we have to wait 25 minutes to talk to her but she was completely rude. When we finally get to our room, with no thanks to the front desk lady's horrible directions, we find clothes in the closet from whomever stayed there before us, completely gross.  The "village" was a joke, more then half of the shops and restaurants were closed and it was pretty much a ghost town ( sold out resort my ass), the casino had no more then 10 people in it including us.   The bed in the room was supposed to be a king but certainly was not,  and it was by far the most uncomfortable bed I've ever laid on, considering the clothes left in the closet it made me very concerned about the cleanliness of the bed and all other aspects of the room.  When I called the desk to complain about the bed, and to see if there was another room with a different bed we could try,  the front desk person informed me that they get complaints all the time about their beds and there was nothing he could do. We checked out early not willing to spend a other night in that hole.   DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME WITH THIS PLACE!   On a side note, the restaurant we ate at, an Italian place across from the bistro, was wonderful, the service was great and the food was delicious.Was pleasantly surprised to find a beautiful crib/changer combo. Purchased it using the promo stated on their FB page for today ($50 off of $100.) However, my experience at this store was ruined when they denied the sale of a Joovy Tricycoo for my nephew because my siblings had not "Liked" the page before hand and therefore would not let them use the promo. It is not that they could not afford the $100 bike, but why pay full price when there is a great promo right in front of their faces?? What really made NO SENSE was the fact that they said YES we could use the promo, then different managers got involved, one said they had to like the page, which they then did, but then got denied saying that they had to like it BEFORE they got to the store. Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't see any "fine print" in that little promo on their FB, do you? Basically, they lost out on a sale, where they could have made an extra $50 today, all because of a policy that was made up right on the spot. I called to complain to a manager as my sister is not one for confrontation, so I said I would wait and the manager tells me she needs to call me back. . . We will see if this actually happens. It was a 40 minute drive for us to get there, and I was excited to see all they had to offer. Unfortunately, if I didn't have to pick my crib up when it comes in, I would never waste my time there again.

Update:

Just got a return call from the manager of the store. He has upset this 6 month pregnant woman by yelling at me to not interrupt him while he was speaking, which I did not say a word after he asked me and then kept saying "GO AHEAD GO AHEAD" VERY RUDELY when I yelled at him to give me the same courtesy. He also kept emphasizing how OBVIOUS it was that people could not like the page at the store. (Implying to me that we were stupid for thinking we could do that, when the sales people said that's what they could do.) He kept telling me that they could cancel my order which is NOT what I had asked for. It's almost as if he wanted me to cancel. So, now that I am so upset, after hanging up on that jerk, I thought about it, canceled my order and will purchase this crib elsewhere. We gave it a shot, it was a cute store, but after the long drive, and the rude phone call from the manager, I am done. 

I would like to say however, that our sales person (I didn't catch her name) was very nice and I have nothing bad to say about her. Thank you for your help. You were very sweet.I had to give 1 start because I couldn't give a ZERO. This place is a scam. Breezy has poor customer service she'll hang up on you and show you no respect. I bought a groupon through her and booked the appointment in advance she waited for it to pass didn't call me or text me at all not even "As she was waiting and waiting for two hours" and now wants to charge me DOUBLE (as in $97) to make an appointment. Do not waste your time!This has seriously gone down hill!! It was fun all the other times we have been there, however, they must have new management or something.  There were so many panhandlers there, more than tourists!!  Everyone has cheesy costumes on and for a "TIP" you too can have your picture taken with smurfs, mini Elvis, fat Elvis, you name it, there is a panhandler there dressed as it!! Then there are people just hanging around with signs begging for money (EVERYWHERE) and sitting in groups on the ground with a place to drop money(for no apparent reason) It is just NASTY!!!!!  It was filthy, it stunk like vomit and urine. The only good thing was the music Bon Jovi!!  I just could not leave fast enough, both of my kids were not happy, I did not see any metro or security!!! The band was LAME!!! A fat chick trying to look like Katy Perry, who is lacking some serious singing skills and her "partner" whose voice is incredibly screechy and and annoying.  I did not even want my kids to see the whole skit about the one "singer" talking about doing something very naughty to the other "singer" as the other "singer" bent over with her butt to the crowd!!!! With a tiny cheerleader/referee outfit on....TACKY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Went here the other night and service was HORRIBLE! At first they refused to seat us inside even though there were plenty of open seats. After a long wait they did seat us, but then (after 30 minutes with only water) never took our order, even after we asked several times. We left and will never return. Way to make your guests feel extremely unwanted and uncomfortable Ali Baba. Go to Pasha if you want good food and service.Absolute worst customer service I have ever had in Las Vegas Nevada. If you're in the industry business you know you EARN your tips by actually paying attention to your  customers, sat for over 30 Minutes minutes waiting for the bartender to come and service us and then he charged us overpriced drinks even after gambling $$$. Do not recommend this bar for any industry employees!!The pharmacy staff here is so rude and slow! I had to come here twice to help my aunt with some prescriptions and if this was my pharmacy I would switch in a heartbeat! Both times I waited over 15 minutes when there was only one person in front of me! They took forever to come to the window and the hung up so quick both times when I tried to ask if I could pick up her prescription at a specific time it was too late he had already hung up the phone/intercom! If they don't have enough staff than they shouldn't have a drive thru window!!!Summary - Not a good experience. Left with the worst pit in my stomach.

We went to Vegas last minute and couldn't get our dog into our favorite place, camp bow wow,  due to an event going on in Vegas that weekend. Due to the decent reviews for this place, we decided take our dog here since they had room and were very friendly in the phone. 

We asked to have a tour when we first arrived and the place was very small and cramped and put off a bad vibe from the start. We paid extra to have our dog play and not be locked in a kennel all day/ night like the pound. When we picked up our dog the next day, our dog had the strangest behavior I have ever seen. She was barking like crazy and trying to go out the front door and completely ignoring us. She was hopping as if something happened to her back leg but wouldn't let anyone get near here as she was hysterical. The worker never said a word the entire time as this was going on. I finally asked the obvious question if something had happened while we were gone to prompt the worker to explain what was going on. The worker said that our dog was the most rambunctious dog they have had and was misbehaved. I've never heard anything like that before in my life about her. She attends day care frequently and the people always love her and say how great she is. Our dog always leaves either happy or really tired from playing. If there was a problem, I would have much rather had them call me and I would have picked her up rather than have her come home traumatized from that place. Like I said, we've had great experiences at a lot of dog day cares and kennels and never have experienced the pit in my stomach that I had after leaving this place.My husband and I went here on a Friday morning for breakfast and it was packed. We thought this was a good sign, until we got our food. I had a waffle with bananas and scrambled eggs and bacon. I the waffle was like cardboard. I couldn't eat more than one bite. I ate most of my eggs, but I felt nauseous afterwards. I also ordered hot chocolate which was pretty good, but thats about it. My husband didn't like his food either - an omelet with sausage links.  The plate with the sausage was swimming in grease. He couldn't even look at it, never mind taste it. We won't be back b/c of the quality of the food.I think I ate a dead dog mixed with mayonnaise.

If you miss mystery food from Public School days, then this is your place.The food itself is a little below average compared to other Korean restaurants. The reason for my low rating is their hospitality. I had couple friends come in town and had never ate Korean food. I took them to this place, hoping they would give a good impression for our friends. The waitress was rude to us, probably viewed us as a bunch 20 year olds. She did not  come by our table beside sitting us down, getting our order, and giving us the check. Couple of older guys, say in their 50s, came in after us. She stood right beside their table the whole time serving them. Also, they got their food way before we got ours. When we got the food, it was somewhat already cooled down. The taste was somewhat bland. Not only was the lady rude, she even complained that we did not give her enough tip. She literally told us, the tip was not enough, even though we ordered two dish and have already gave her $5 as tip without complaining about her inhospitality. We end up giving her $8 tip before we left. This left a very bad impression on my friend, that he does not ever want to eat at a Korean restaurant ever again. So in conclusion, my suggestion is that unless you are in the older crowds and you are Korean, this place probably isn't the best choice.I am very disappointed in their services.  I agree that navigating the phone system is a nightmare...and they don't get back to you...ever.  I had a very minor procedure done in the office and they didn't fix it...but they want to keep charging me a copay and also charge my insurance company repeatedly to get it right.Will never even think about this place ever again. The so-called "mechanic" was unprofessional. Damaged my car while attempting to drive up the ramp to perform an alignment on my car. I have to "YELL" at the tech guiding him to stop while I demanded the tech that drove my car to get out. Very immature "mechanics" as they were yelling comments as I was driving off to another location for my alignment service. 

This was my fault bringing my car here. Presentation speaks loud. Their image was horrible. Looked like they came right out of high-school driving beaters who claimed themselves' as professionals.

Tsk Tsk on me

The owner/manager was even worst. White man with gray hair.Either I have ginger-vitis or he's a retard.. probably both now. gross.Brutally scammed!  I went to Vegas for a mens softball tournament, and there were 10 of us.  We reserved 2 full sized sedans, and the seemingly helpful person at the counter advised us that we could get a huge van that seats 12 for the same combined cost of the 2 sedans.  It took us all of about 10 seconds to agree to switching to the van, and throughout our stay kept commenting on how the guy at the counter helped save us from being crammed in 2 cars.   

Everything was good, until I dropped off my friends at the airport and drove back to Budget to return the car.... They added a $150 upgrade fee.  I advised the lady behind the counter we were specifically told that the cost of the Van would be equal to the cost of the 2 sedans.  The canned response was that the charge was the same, but there is an upgrade fee charged to do it.  I immediately asked for the manager and was told "He's not in, but I can give you his business card".  I nicely asked for that upgrade fee to be removed, advising again we were never told of it and if we were never would have agreed to the change, and finally advised that all the guys that went in on the rental with me were gone and I didn't want to be stuck with this ridiculous fee.   I was told to contact the manager with my dispute, but of course the charges would all be put on my card.

I felt like my only choices were to allow myself to become a victim so I don't miss my flight, or stay and wait for the manager to get my refund which I probably wouldn't get, and would still miss my flight.  I took the flight, and must have left about 10 voicemails with the manager with no response.  It became increasingly clear they run this scam knowing once you have left on your plane, there is virtually nothing you can do.  They are the disgrace of an already disgraceful industry.  Thanks for taking my $150.The knuckle draggers working in the lot itself failed to meet even the most modest expectations. Apparently there is a don't talk to the customers rule in place. You are just supposed to guess if this is your car at pickup time and guess again if they are done with the  paperwork on the return.Worst shop ever!!! Overpriced!!! Bootleg products!!! Rude staff!!!

If I could give 0 stars I would.

These jokers will try to sell you bootleg synthetic urine...wonder if they actually pee in the bag themselves... I would check it before leaving the store, unless u don't really care whether or not u pass ur test.

Bottom line: this place is run by shysters and rip off artists. Steer clear!I went to the ER for hyperemesis which is sever nausea and stayed a total of 5 hours.  I never received a bill until I got a collection notice for $900.  Apparently the staff wrote down the wrong policy number and my claim was denied.  After giving them the correct policy number, I got a bill for $9000 and that I owed $1500.  The bill didn't even tell me what they were charging me for just a lump sum.  How can they get away with this?  What?!?  All they gave me was an IV and meds I could have had my doctor prescribe for $10.  I was told there is not much they can do for me.  Needless to say - I will have to think twice about having my baby there or ever going back.Horrible service! I've been there over a dozen times and every single time we went, they would mess something up.I am a frequent customer and have been for years. I went in one summer day to fulfill my cravings for their famous BBQ chicken with rice to go. Daniel (Danny), who did the order taking, did not offer me a greeting and had a monotone voice. Not even a smile was shown. It was like talking to a robot. He clearly did not feel like being there at all. When my order was ready, my food wasn't sealed properly and was slid from the register area to the end of the counter where I was at. He didn't even offer me a thank you or farewell. I just left right away because I was starving. It wasn't busy at all, only one other customer there.

When I reached home, I opened my to go box and found out there was no rice at all, just the mac salad along with my chicken. I was so disappointed. I went back to l&l to get my order fixed. As no surprise, I received no greeting from Daniel again. I told him about my rice that was supposed to come with my meal. He gave me a "sigh" right in front of my face and turned around and scooped rice and placed it in my to go box. No apology was given when he returned the box. Just quickly turned around and went about his business. When I returned home, I opened my box and found a 1/2 scooped rice in my box. Not even a full scoop was given to me after I drove all the way back there. 

It is quite clear Daniel (Danny) isn't paying close attention. Not only is he rude, he is an example who will drive l&l customers away from the restaurant. He ruined my whole experience and I will never come back there. I encourage all l&l customers to stay away from that establishment. I would give this place "Zero" stars if I could because of Daniel.

The company should FIRE Daniel. He is not a good example of an L&L employee. The total opposite actually.The only reason I am leaving this review is that I saw that one of the people in this firm joined LinkedIn so I go the update. I wanted to warn you, use this firm at your peril.

Unfortunately, the same experience as at least one other reviewer in terms of response time.  I used Garrett Cooper for many years and I very rarely got an answer back via phone in any sort of reasonable time frame.  The last year I used them I received an inquiry from the IRS 2 years later and Rick Garrett was nowhere to be found. Call after call to find out what the IRS wanted and how I should respond went unanswered. When I finally just showed up at the office some months later, I got excuses about major life events and no answers. 

It may be that these guys are a notch above H&R Block,  but the bar must be pretty low. I own a business with very complicated returns and it took me years to recover from the blunder and lack of response from Garrett Cooper. It's one thing to tout your history as a federal employee as core credential, it is entirely another to actually put that expertise into practice.Expected a lot more from a Green Valley Ranch establishment.  The sushi chefs do not take any pride in their food.  The fish was fresh but the presentation was very poor.  Most of the excellent sushi chefs take alot of pride in their food.  This is not the case here.  Sushi rolls were very poorly made and the presentation was very poor.  We arrived on a Saturday night at 8pm. The sushi bar was empty.  We were not welcomed immediately by the sushi chefs.  We actually had to ask them twice if they were open.  Rolls were okay tasting but again, the rolls were falling apart.  The quality is not consistent with prices that they charge.  could also be another reason, why it was empty on a Saturday night.  We did speak with the manager and she apologized and took off one of the rolls but it seems that they do not seem to care.  Not worth it.  Grocery stores have better sushi. (we did tip the server, the presentation and lack of caring about their food was not his fault)We had the all you can eat special . The fish didn't taste fresh ( which makes sense why they give you such large portions, they are probably trying to use it up instead of discarding it) the waiter mixed up our appetizer and when we said it was the wrong one he told us to eat it because it's usually $24.95 by itself and we were lucky to be 
getting it for the all you can eat price. Then my boyfriends rice on his sushi tasted sour. We should have just left then and there but we felt bad since we had already put our roll orders in. Needless to say on the five minute drive we had to take home, both of us got sick extremely fast ... From every end you could imagine.To be fair, this is not my typical scene. But even if it's not, a good place should draw my interest, no matter its target clientele. Instead, the people working there are a mix of aggressive bouncers and airheaded bartenders. I was disappointed. Not only are their well drinks pretty pricey, but the music just plain uninspires. I spent a while on the rooftop bar and wondered why everyone was enjoying themselves. The DJ played the same boring, unoriginal beat 1,000 times over and over, yet people were eating it up. I think I'm not cool enough to understand. I heard they're under a new general manager, so maybe this place will get better. The space is great, but the atmosphere is such a bummer here that I can't be any kinder.Lipstick on a pig!  What a huge disappointment.  Only a few rooms actually renovated but they BS you and con you when taking reservations and on their website, then hassle you when you check in and find out your room is not one of the 'newly renovated' rooms - a rip off!.  Renovations are minimal.  Showerhead sucked; one sink; nice 40" TV, but without HD signals why bother?  They invested minimal $ to renovate the old Alladin - would not recommend this dump to anyone!  Spend a few more bucks and stay anywhere else.   The Spice Market Buffet sucks - buried down in the basement/lower level; high walls make it way to claustrophobic and the food sucks as does the service. Best thing about the stay....Rudy the bellman took care of us big time with limo's, etc...he needs to move to a nicer property to make more money.DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE WE DID
I stayed here over the past weekend with my wife and a group of friends. When we checked out there was a charge on our room that neither my wife or I approved or knew about. I called the front desk and waited for over 20 minutes for anyone to answer only to be told they could not help and would transfer me to the Spice market Buffet where the charge was from. When they transferred me it was a dead line. NOT COOL!! called the front desk back, waited again, this time the took my phone number and said they would call me back. When they did call me back they just said that the charge was valid and that they could do nothing about it. I explained that i had signed nothing stating that there would be any charge to my room above the $200 credit on the room. I also explained that our room was never cleaned on Saturday. I was again advised that someone would call me back. They did call me back and state that they would refund another party of our group to "make it right". Not really sure how this helps me out at all. Bottom line is no refund has been issued and the additional charge to my card was done fraudulently! Planet Hollywood please call me and make this right!!!Don't charge me $30 for crab legs if you're gonna serve them in a plastic bag. Also, our food took 20 min & the service was pretty slow. Not coming backthe service was SUPER slow for lunch on a Thursday even though my 2 cousins and I were 3 of like 10 people that were dining here.  our waitress talked us into getting their 2 for 1 drink special.  THe first mojito that I ordered was really watered down so I had to ask the waitress to add an extra shot of rum to my 2nd drink.  The only reason why we ate here was because we just arrived from San Francisco, were staying at the PH Towers and were STAR-VING.  I probably wouldn't eat here again because there's definitely better options everywhere else.I really can not believe all the good reviews of this place... Maybe they just had a bad day when I went......... 

If you have ever walked into this place it has a different vibe... I am assuming they are going for the beachfront cafe, swim suits hanging from the ceiling, surf boards leaning on the walls and palms everywhere. I had never been here before so upon my original scan of the place it looks like you walk up and order then go sit down.. After standing in the middle of the room looking like a lost sheep for about 5 minutes they crabby waitress walked by and crudely said, "  just sit anywhere" and kept on walking. We sat down and both comment to each other, " Wow that was rude!"  

She came back a few minutes later and handed us 2 menus and quickly said, " do you need a kids menu?" we again said Yes and it was a good 5 to 10 minute wait for the kids menu. Once we finally received the kids menu and decided what we all wanted we ordered..... 2 Cabo salads and a kids chicken fingers.. Now, just to set the stage here. There was 4 tables with people at them and all of them had there food so we happen to be the only ones without food so in my head I figured it would be fast. The waitress came by to see if we wanted something other than water to drink and I said sure, Ill take a iced tea. She brought the iced tea pretty quick which was nice but a few minutes later my iced tea was about half empty and she came by and grabbed it....... Now.. I was thinking that this entire experience was turning around, I could not be more wrong... Remember that Iced tea I was talking about? Well I didn't because she never brought it back. She even came by the table 5 minutes later to tell us that the food we will be out in a few and sorry for the wait. Now I know i could have said can i have my iced tea back but i figured she may have been busy and i would give her a minute. The food came out and I was half way through my salad and decided i would really like my iced tea so she came by to ask how the food was and I just mentioned, " It is good, when you get a chance can I get an Iced Tea!" it took another 5 minutes for that to come..... At this point I was done and did not want to be on the beach any longer. The food was okay but the wait service was less than horrible. 

I'm sorry Beach Cafe but I will not be back!!!! You need to hire some new wait staff and get rid of the grouch you have in the front... I have never seen a waitress walk around with such a horrible attitude! I know we all have bad days but in a customer contact position like that you need to be able to detour your pissiness for a little while.

I can get good food anywhere, good service is what i am trying to find and Beach Cafe had no trace of it.Horrible food!!!  I sent my first meal back and the second was just as bad!  Don't waste your money at this establishment!  Even the chips were stale!We live in San Diego and planned our wedding in Las Vegas. After searching the internet it appeared that Maria's, Freed's and Leopold's are the main bakerys that make and deliver wedding cakes. Leopold's allowed us to bring in our own cake decorating flowers and had charged the least for delivery so we went with them to help with our budget. We ordered a two tier cake. Chocolate with chocolate mouse on the bottom and cheesecake on top. The cake looked beautiful for the pictures and the flowers were placed perfectly. I took the first bite of cheesecake and leaned to my bride, holding back a laugh, and said it tasted like insect replellant. I the then tasted the chocolate and couldn't believe how dry and flavorless it was. I laughed again and said it tasted like cardboard. We were in a great mood and laughed as she spit it out her bite. Even the three kids at the reception didn't have more than one bite of cake. When have you ever seen that before! Perhaps I should have read the reviews on yelp first, but hopefuly my review will help you. This bakery should be in the wedding cake model business. Perhaps their time has come and gone. A+ for appearance. F for taste.NASTY NASTY NASTY sandwich.  Pulled turkey on wheat.  I think our cat eats better food than this.  I don't know what all of the hype is about., but the sandwich I had was a waste of money.  The DRIEST turkey.  Seriously - like someone rolled the meat up in a paper towel and squeezed every last bit of moisture.  Oh, and the chick who made it looked like she was still wasted on something from the night before.  Ugh, that probably had something to do with it too.  I should just stick with Subway when I'm away from the yummy delis in the SF Bay.I just don't get why people think this pizza is so great! The crust is never done enough and bread is always raw-doughy inside. We have been to Metro more than once and it always seems the same. It is just below average to average pizza that is way overpriced!

I would much rather have Champion Pizza off of Gibson.Its a decent cupcake but nowhere near the hype it gets. There are much better cupcakes to be had without having to deal with the horrible parking situation and sometimes long lines.Ugh...just returned from my First Friday experience. and I need to take a bleach shower. Unfortunately, I could not find ANY art, anywhere...just the same old faux cool, dark, post-punk, comic book, psycho-sexualized popular culture garbage that everyone is trying to pass off as art. You know, the constant knockoffs of already tired cultural icons.. glitter paint by number portraits of Johnny Cash and Bruce Lee, Batman pornography, chollo Mickey Mouse  gang-banger tee shirts...oh, and let's not forget Betty Paige...she's always "original." Everything designed to shock and offend, nothing to elevate perception or experience. Looked in vain to find something original, inspiring or beautiful...NO luck., just lots of ugly, third rate pop culture garbage. Seems lots of people are devotees of the Andy Wharhol School. Plenty of tacky flea market style jewelry stands, lots of unruly drunk/high, aggressive high school kids with loud and filthy mouths...trash everywhere, oh...and getting back to the "art" the majority of "work" revolves around central themes of skulls, death, pain, violence and hopelessness because as several artists told me, "death and suffering is always mysterious  and cool. It's what's selling now." Oh...kayyyyy...if it really is true that art reveals the character of a culture, then we are all probably in BIG, BIG trouble. I know better than to ever do that again to myself.Unbelievably rude service. I came here on a Sunday with two friends and we were the first people in the restaurant. We waited at the front for a while and the servers were too busy chatting with each other to acknowledge us so we sat ourselves. Once our server realized we had sat ourselves she had the audacity to tell us to in a very condescending tone to "wait for the hostess in the future". Again, we were the only people there. Do you really think you can be that rude to people when they sit down and expect them to stay?

We got up and left, and I will not return. Switch has been officially scratched off my list of Sunday brunches for this ridiculous behavior and I will be sure to tell anyone who suggests we visit in the future.Ok. So this was my second trip there.  The first time was early on a Tuesday about a year ago, and I remember it being somewhat enjoyable. This time was about 2pm on a Sunday.

We wait about 5 mins for a table even though there seems to be plenty of seating.

First of all, our waitress must have been stoned.  For her sake I hope she was not naturally that slow.  We had plenty of time to look over our menus since there seemed to be only 2 people working.  After telling her my order, included what I wanted as side, she informs me I have a choice of side and tells me my options. "Like I said, I'll have the bacon."

No water offered to start off with, had to request some water.  No refills offered for our tea. WTF? Who sees a visibly empty glass on a table and does not offer a refill.  The drink glass was tiny too.  Like juice-cup style.

The bacon sucked so bad.  Hard, thin, no flavor (maybe I'm spoiled from Matt's) 

The portions were small.  The waitress look flustered and although she was cute and trendy looking, I don't go out to eat for trend watching.

I had the Sweet Potato pancakes.  She forgot the maple syrup.  Had to wait like 10 mins for her to come around so I could flag her down to bring some.

The "toast" was cold hard bread.  The crust was so hard it hurt my mouth.

The people around us seemed to be having a nice time.  Meanwhile I'm sitting there kinda disgusted actually with how everything is going down.  Maybe we were being discriminated against because we didnt get all spiffied up to go to brunch? I had time to speculate...

The only positive thing I can say was that it was a beautiful day outside and they had an impressive tea selection.

I got the impression this place put more emphasis on looking "cool and hip" on paper than good service and execution.

If you want to have long conversations, browse periodicals, being outside on a nice day, and be seen this might be the place for you.

If you want prompt service, generous yummy portions, keen waitstaff that recognize you exist and the money you are about to drop there goes towards their paycheck, not the best choice.I called abt the shuttle service before getting to Vegas and they said there is no waiting and I'd be the 3rd stop. I asked the man who answered the phone to assure me that the shuttle would be faster than the taxi line and he did. It was not faster, it was more expensive and we were the 6th stop! Further we had to wait until each seat on the bus was full before leaving the airport! Never using it again!if i could i would give this place no stars at all... i went with a bachelorette party on saturday june 23. when we sat down i had made it very clear to the waiter that we wanted our food asap (we had a show to go to in roughly 45min) most of us ordered the three course meal deal.. one friend ordered the Tomato bisque the kitchen instead gave us a LOBSTER bisque which is the last thing my friend would have ordered since she hates seafood. In the end the waiter still charged us for a LOBSTER bisque even though we ordered tomato bisque. We ordered our steak medium and the steak came out completely well done if not OVER COOKED there was no pink left in this piece of meat whatsoever, it was dry and way way over cooked... by the time the desserts came out we were already 15min late for our show.. all in all i had a horrible experience here. The waiter was HORRIBLE he was never at our table checking on us, it took us at least 20min to sort out the bisque situation in which he blamed the kitchen (yet when the bill came out we were charged for a LOBSTER bisque) the food was HORRIBLE (i have never ordered a steak at a steak rest. where they served the steak so over cooked that it just crumbled up in my mouth when we ordered it medium!) i will never ever come back and i am shocked this place is still running cause their staff was just horrendous! I should have left a formal complaint with the manager but we were so late i didn't have time to put one in... If you are reading this please re-think your visit, your in vegas there are a 1000 better steak restaurants in Las Vegas...Horrible policy here.  I used the call ahead feature on a busy night and was told that the wait is 25 minutes, and my name was now on the list.  Sounds good, right?  I arrive 25 minutes later to check in and I'm told that I should expect to get a table in about 25-30 minutes.  What?!? This is insane and unlike most other places that have the call ahead feature. 

Minor mention:  the happy hour changed in the last year or so and several items are no longer discounted at all (like Mozz sticks), and the items that are discounted are presented on a separate menu that categorizes them by price (these apps for $7, these for $9, etc.)  This is a growing trend as places no longer want to clearly indicate half off, or a specified amount off, and want to try and redirect your attention away from how much you're actually saving by going to happy hour.The most awful service of any Chilis on the planet, I ordered a simple salad, stood there for 15 minutes, no salad, no one cared, I asked for refund so I could make my flight.  On the flight in First Class to go pick up my Embraer Phenom 300 jet that was in service center, they had zero food, not even peanuts or pretzels, geez wonder why US Air will go bankrupt just like American Airlines recently did??

Wayne GorsekI come here all the time for years and sadly the service and food have now consistently been horrendous. I have returned food to the kitchen several times, it was either wrong, freezing cold or torn wraps and burger buns. Attitude sank to such bitchy lows, no quality control, a new menu that is just retarded and over priced. I will not return to this place ever again, me and my crew of 6 regulars have all agreed this place went to hell and is run by 15 year old children that don't give a damn about no one but their friends that come in after high school and get free drinks.So this used to be a five star place. A few months ago I wrote a review about the changes in the menu that made me switch it to a one star review. 

I came back tonight for the first time since to watch the Wildcats game and drink a beer. They are now charging a $5 cover. Are you kidding me? We aren't in downtown Scottsdale. Goodbye. Never again. Such greed. WowSeriously, I'd go negative if I could. I have NEVER EVER walked out of a restaurant in my life until I came here.

RUN DOWN DENNYS + SENIOR CITIZEN HOME = SIDEWALK CAFE

I got super trashed at XS the night before so I had to skip out on my reservation at Craftsteak. I didn't want to go there looking like a zombie. Sidewalk Cafe was the closest spot getting off the elevator. GF and I got seated farily quick. One girl taking order for drinks. Steak and shrimp dinner special for $11.99? Alright! Ok not really. 15-20 minutes go by. We are staring at each other like, "Where the hell is our server". Then we see 1 lady serving and bussing over 10 tables. 

Conclusion: Forget it! Downed our waters and walked out.

I tried to make a second attempt here because this is the ONLY place in Bally's that actually serves breakfast. But nope, that line was super long and I knew that line wasn't the only thing I'd be waiting in.

Attempt #2, failed.This is my least favorite sushi place in the valley.  I think gas station sushi would have tasted better.  The edamame wasn't cooked properly and had too much salt, the tuna in the Alaskan roll tasted like it came straight out of a can, and the soda was flat.  The only thing that tasted okay was the water."Quite possibly the culinary center of the universe" is what was printed on the front door. I'm not too sure about that. At all.

Picture this: Take some WW2 nuclear ration canned spaghetti sauce, 3 types of left over hodgepodge noodles, make sure it's barely lukewarm and literally throw it all on top of a wood table. Insert fork and knife, a gross salad soaked in Italian and room temperature bread straight from the super market down the road and you have the recipe for my Saturday night. I didn't get the chance to order off the menu but I will most definitely not be coming back to test my luck.

I have 3 reasons for my one star. 1) Once again, I cannot give it 0 stars. 2) The bartender was a good dude who served a quick Spotted Cow. 3) The decor was a laughable mix of a pirate ship's hull and a 60 year old woman's fake art collection.

This place is definitely the center of some universe but one that I live on and I think later on tonight, my stomach will agree with me.I visited Clarendon Kitchen twice. My first time was bad. The most tasteless, boring food I have experienced in a long time. How can anyone make a bad burger? Burnt on one side and the chips they give you pre-meal were un-edible, stale and flavorless.  I hoped it was a bad night or a fluke in the kitchen, so I deceided to give it another shot.
I had lunch 08/09/08 and it was even WORSE. The food which took forever, was just bad, it was awful. I hate to use flavorless again. But it was FLAVORLESS. Has the chef ever heard of spices? This is a Mexican restaurant, afterall. After a few bites I quit and vowed never to return. 

What a shame too since I live right across the street.We ate here early on a Friday night.  It was not crowded, but took 20 minutes for someone to come to the table.  I ordered a margarita - who the heck serves a margarita in a tumbler?  It was horrible - straight out of a cheap bottle of mix, not cold and little alcohol.

Hubby ordered onion rings as a starter.  After 10 minutes we were told they were out of onion rings.  What kind of bar has no onion rings at 6:00pm on a Friday?  We ordered dinner.  Mac and cheese was average.  Deep fried mushrooms came straight out of a Costco bag.  Hubby's beef sandwich was gristley.  My garlic toast was made with a hamburger bun!

There's no creativity or any resemblance of fresh food in this bar.  if you like bags of frozen stuff and bottles of mix, this is the place to goThis has been one if the worst experiences of my life.
Met friends there 3 hours before Love show; waited 1.5 hours to be seated.
After another 1/2 hour we got our orders.
I had chicken casedia, $17, when I bit into second piece A LATEX GLOVE CAME OUT AND WAS HANGING FROM MY MOUTH.
After throwing up and cleaning up in the bathroom I came back, had some words for the 'manager'; his way of dealing with it was kicking me out, and threatening me with arrest!!!!!!
No apology, nothing. 
STAY AWAY!!!!I had heard good things about this place so I was pretty disappointed when the sandwich turned out to be even less appetizing than a Subway meal. And that's a stretch, cause I don't really like Subway, either. Silver Mine's subs were overpriced for a totally bland sandwich. Bummer. I imagine they'd be good if you're drunk and hungry for total crap at 2am, but I wasn't. It wasn't even filling.Just went to get tickets from town square and I can say I'll never go back. When asked for the best tickets at the best price I ended up in the least row of a show for more than what I would have paid for better tickets with a local discount. Mainly my fault for trusting someone that should know their job and that I would think would want to do what's best for people but I was wrong. Town square...don't go thereFriendly service but slow.  Carpaccio is good everything else was the worst I've eaten.  If people think this is authentic Italian then they must put Olive Garden as a 4 star.  This is a far cry from a good Italian restaurant.My sister purchased a livingsocial voucher for me as a birthday present.
We both went today and both left feeling like we were better off before we went in.

My sister made the appointment a month ago and it was for a facial, massage and pedicure.  We were expecting a call to confirm the appointment yesterday but no one had called, hmmm, not very professional...
We went in and the majority of the "spa" is a hair salon, I'm not too fond of hair salons calling themselves a "spa" just because they have a couple of massage and facial rooms, but whatever, we'll see how the staff is...

We both got massages first and I got the blind lady, Evon.  I read the other yelp reviews before heading in but I had also gotten massages by blind people in China, which were awesome, so I went in with an open mind.  She was nice and had a good energy but her technique was not refined.  Her strokes were short and clumsy and I don't think she even has a massage license (I didn't have the heart to ask).  She tried getting the pressure points, but missed, she didn't really know how to get rid of my huge shoulder knot and I kind of just wanted the massage to be over.  She was quick on each of the body parts and she had this kind of timer device that she checked periodically and when she realized that there's still plenty of time left, she would find a body part to massage.  It was like child's play massage.  When I left the room, her husband wasn't sitting out in the waiting area like another yelper had mentioned before, but he was in the salon because I heard him later on.

So there was some mix up with my appointment because instead of getting a facial right after my massage, I was taken in for my pedicure.  The lady, Tanya was a little off.  She didn't have me pick out my nail color first, and she had me soaking in the water too long because she had to finish up with someone else.  My feet were so pruney that I think she cut my skin while cutting my nails but it's hard for me to tell.  She didn't ask how I liked my nails cut and made them round when I like them square.  Her painting job was amateur to say the least, there's paint all over my cuticles and skin.  She was nice but I'm paying for a service to be done properly.  My paint job was better than this one, I'm really tempted to just remove the color so I can re-do it myself.  Tanya was also talking to me for so long that she didn't watch the time and we were going over.

Julie then took me in for my facial and she was very polite and professional - she apologized for the mix-up, the regular receptionist is away getting married or something, so hence the confusion.  She also apologized for Tanya and also for her daughter that had come to hang out at the salon.  Julie's facial was good, she put me to sleep at one point, so that's a good sign.

I like small businesses because 90% of businesses are small businesses, however, I don't like small businesses that doesn't focus on the customer - because, hello, that's who's paying the bills!  
Gotta cater to the customers so they will come back.Little Las Vegas with all their cultural imitation crap, except without the fun.My girlfriend and I are huge Beatles and Cirque du soleil fans and we were really excited to see this show. We loved beatles music and we love Cirque Du soleil so of course we would enjoy this show right? wrong!

This isn't like other cirque shows (mystere, ka, corteo, kooza), this is more like a dance show to beatles music. There are very little trapeze acts, contortionists, and things that amaze you. Instead people dance and walk around, come down from bungies, and rollerblade. Nothing here is truly amazing.

I was bored when watching this and couldn't wait for it to end. 
after paying $150 for tickets we felt ripped off! We had to see another show to feel satisfied and saw the blue man group the next night (which was awesome by the way). 

If you haven't seen a cirque show you will probably like this show, but if you've seen other traditional shows you will probably be bored. It seems Cirque is just lending their name out to new dance shows (viva Elvis, Chris angel believe), so I won't see any of these shows since I heard they're basically the same. 

If you haven't seen a cirque show before I highly recommend Mystere at the treasure island. You will not be disappointed.Ambience is good. That's about it. Service is below average.  Food is subpar. Very small portion. Salad looks so tired and tastes tired. Meat is too rough to be chewable. Even fried calamari is unchewable.  Disappointing experience.Stopped in the lube shop for an oil change. Walked inside and was shocked how dirty the place was. The bathroom reminded me of a prison movie, filthy doesn't describe its disgusting condition. I figured the oil change is quick so just deal with it. While waiting I started thinking while listening to the staff yelling and joking that the inmates taken over the jail. Bad feeling was growing. They pulled car out, said all done, paid and left. Drove across town for a meeting, got out and oil was pouring out under the car. What a pain in the neck. Took to the nearest store that was clean, staff fixed with no trouble.
Usually these guys are great but this location will never be a stop for me again.First off, let me say that I'm very impressed with all aspects of both the Venetian and the Palazzo.

Everything except for one thing: they added $2.60 to each of my drinks at the pool without listing such a charge on the receipt. I'm not one to cry over spilled milk, but it's just a little sheisty, no? A $12 bloody mary with a standard $1 tip somehow shows up as a $15.60 drink.

Thanks, Palazzo!I was going to write a review  a few weeks ago about this place but  after seeing the 2 other reviews i thought it was unnecessary...i then saw the last review ( not sure why i did not see the last review before ) giving a 5 star rating and i almost lost my dinner....are you kidding me ??  i am still laughing about the appetizers - i guess i didn't hit the jackpot like one of the other reviewers -  SO and I got 7 onion rings - costing $6.95 ...keep in mnd this is not in a resort casino and it's not a michelin rating  foo-foo place...and the rings weren't wortha shit !  the crab cakes...are you sure they used crabe...alot of "filling " in these lil buggers and for ...hmmm...i forget the price ...over $10 for sure...a fish place with limited fish offerings...SO who was hankering for some fish wound up ordering a vegetarian plate that had succotash, mushrooms and ...i forget the 3rd item...she ate one mushroom one bite of the succotash and pushed the plate away...and i ate a burger - dry can be - the bacon on top was tasty....i usually give most restaurants 2 tries before i give it a thumbs up or down...nope i ain't wasting the $$$  on thsi shithole again .....my prediction...this place won't last past 2008I eat sushi probably two times a week and I love trying new places around my area. I have tried this place three times and each time I have gone there the service was so HORRIBLE that I will NEVER go back. It took me 15 minutes for me to even have someone come greet my table and another 15 min to order. Now I would understand the long wait if it was around lunch or dinner time but this was at 2 in the afternoon on a weekday. When I finally ordered it took about another 45 minutes to even get my salad and sushi. They forgot some of my order and at this point I was done. The second time I went I was there for dinner and the same thing happend but a longer wait! The manager came over and took off our salad which only cost us 4.00, I would assume for such bad service that they would have tried to make us a little more happy but comp'ing off one salad was no acceptable. I will never go back there and I advise you all not to either!Maybe my expectations were too high for this event, based on the $30 price tag.  Loved the Chihuly exhibit, but the luminaries didn't really add much more to the exhibit.  Without the Chihuly, i'm not sure why you would go to this event.  I think this is way overpriced.  The paths that did not have any Chihuly pieces were just dark paths with luminaries.....absolutely nothing to see.  I thought some of the desert plants would have some lighting, but they didn't....just dark paths through desert.  It was nice to walk around, but I could go walk through the dark desert with a flashlight and get the same effect.  Some of the entertainment was interesting, but nothing off the charts.  I'm going to save the $30 in the future.A coworker had prompted me to try this chain telling me how great it was so I had to give it a shot. i quickly glanced at the menu board and decided to go with barbacoa. i looked over the partition to view the other add ins and noticed that the shredded chicken in another container was swimming in a thick film of red oil and the meat looked "plastic" like and not natural. 

I should of walked out at that point but for some reason, decided to ignore that and was compelled to move on. I added black beans, rice, guacamole, medium spice sauce, lettuce, and pico de gallo. 

The burrito was very big, maybe slightly bigger than Chipotle or Zabas. it went down hill from there. I got home and my burrito was sitting in a lot of liquid. Probably from the pico de gallo not having been drained well. The tortilla was soggy and worse was, the pork was so sweet, it was like biting in a bbq pulled pork burrito. Dont get me wrong, I love pulled pork but i was just not expecting my barbacoa burrito meat to taste like that. It was just an unpleasant surprise and really turned me off to this place. Back to Zabas and Qdoba I go.I'm surprised to see all the great reviews for this place - I think its terrible in many ways...

I work across the street and my coworkers and I often head over to the AZ center for Happy Hour. We've tried 1130 a few times and each time leave disappointed. This place tries to be more than it is and charges a pretty penny for its mediocre food and horrible service. I've been in there when there are only 2 other tables filled in the entire place and not seen my waiter for 20 minutes. My glass empty and my group ready for another round.

On our last trip, we got there 10 minutes before they started happy hour - they wouldn't serve us at happy hour prices, so we said come back in 10 minutes then. Most places I've been will gladly serve you and just wait to punch in the order in a few minutes, but 1130 was not interested in do this. So, after 10 minutes, no waiter. 25 minutes, no waiter. Some goofy dude came out after a while and told us our waiter was getting dressed and would be right out.... Another 10 minutes later, she made her way out and we finally got our order in!!

When she brought our beers ( 2 8th Streets, 2 Blue Moons) she handed us the glasses - who does that? Every place I've ever been sits them on the table rather than awkwardly hand them to you risking spilling it all over you... Whats worse is the pint glasses weren't even full!! They looked as though our late dressing waitress had taken a fat gulp out of them on her way to our table!!

We also ordered some Calamari, luckily it was happy hour so it was 1/2 way affordable, but it was heavy on the garnish and few on the calamaris. There were 4 of us and you know how it is when you share an ap, nobody wants to be the one to finish it - well, our waitress finally made her way back to our table (after I had an empty glass for over 10 minutes) and without asking took the plate of calamari! For RUDE! Paws off lady, ask first before grabbing at our food. 

Overall, this place is trying to be way more than it actually is. Its way overpriced for what you get. The service is horrendous - and I say that only after giving it several tries. It might be an okay place to grab a drink (it is cozy afterall) but even at $3.25 happy hour pints, it ain't cheap. I just don't see it lasting long at that location.The customer service is absolutely terrible.  I have been there 3 times now, giving it a fair chance, and each time the employees were rude.  I went tonight to try and redeem a groupon and they said that they did not accept it and that groupon had made a mistake.  There were no exceptions.  NOT how a small business should be run.  I will not be backUm.... I was scolded by the bouncer here for trying to take a cell phone picture of my wife in front of a wall of shoes.Found this place last night on bringfido.com, I was in the area and had my dog with me so needed a place that was pet friendly. The ONLY good thing about this place was the large pet friendly patio area.
We sat for a long time before even being acknowledged. In the dozen times a server walked by, not a single "be right with you"
No drink refills
After asking for a box, she began to place other customers dirty plates on top of my boyfriends plate making a comment like "if you say you didn't like it I can take it off your bill." I had to stop her from laying dirty dishes on our food and explained that we would be taking the food home if she brought a box. 

I could go on and on but will sum it up like this: 

Terrible service, possibly worst ever.

The food was so-so.

Won't be back.We are "clueless" where to dine & were pretty tired from our drive from Colorado and a stop over in Salina, UT... we decided just to go with the flow.  We were all hungry, at that point, so on that faithful Sunday July 20 we gave Paradise Garden Buffet a try.

With the price for the buffet, we ARE Indeed Disappointed.  The only thumbs up is the dessert spread.  The only thing I can think of.  The rest of the food is pretty much ok, not so great.  Some food that is supposed to be hot was cold and just plain bland.

Nevertheless, we will try to visit Vegas and explore other places in the future.  Save your money on some where else ... just DO NOT GO here... I rest my case.My husband and I recently went to this buffet while in Vegas on vacation.  I wouldn't recommend this buffet to anyone - most of the food looked dried out and like it had been sitting out for too long, although the desserts looked okay and the crepes bar was a nice touch.  The food was was average at best, but the worst part of our meal was when my husband bit into a piece of chicken and it was still raw in the middle.  Not just pink, but literally oozing bloody chicken juice!  We complained to the server and she removed the plate and then returned to our table to say that they checked the temperature on the chicken and decided to remove the tray.  Not that we were expecting any compensation, but an apology or a visit from a manager would have been nice, considering how sick a person can get from uncooked chicken.  My husband spent the rest of the night feeling ill, and it really put a damper on our last evening of vacation.

My advice? Steer clear of this buffet, there are many better places to eat in Vegas.Absolutely crappy service.  Took over 1/2 hour to get serve from time of ordering.  Almost immediately got sick and developed "D" after eating the Salmon entree.  I was disappointed as I have always liked this restaurant. I will not return.This got to be the worst Thai food I've eaten. Service is excellent though, but don't know that much English. Tasteless food. Pork ribs with too much fat. Like most of the reviews stated, this place seem more Chinese than Thai. Broccoli chicken seemed microwaved because the broccoli was crunchy and the chicken didn't taste like chicken. The eggrolls tasted like plastic, and the rice was very soggy. I will probably just come back for the Thai Tea and That Iced Coffee.The "sushi chefs" are cackling, blond inexperienced chefs. Despite that, the sushi is decent. The sashimi is pathetic. And the nigiri is pitiful.
The drinks are also decent. The decor is what you would expect for a higher-class Scottsdale establishment. But this is yet another place where you need to have a drink or two, be seen, then go elsewhere for the food.

One star for the adequate pour on the drinks we ordered.The coffee is great but the service is TERRIBLE! Waited 25 minutes as 4th in line because the barista is chatting to his peeps and going slower than a slug in ice. The counter crew needs to lose the attitude and realize good service is what keeps customers. 
There are other great coffee shops like Lux and Drip in Phoenix. I will not go back to Cartel.Boring crust, overly sweet sauce, tasteless, unmelted cheese, overall boring food. In my Humble opinion, this Pie is not worth repeating.Very poor service, came during sports hours. Staff refused to change it to a station we of our interest. They do have 5 T.V.s  Was actually told "I am busy."   Beside that the pizza was doughy with a minimal amount of cheese. Salad was overpriced and just average, and calamari sauce was watery. Staff were advised how upset we were after telling them I had a groupon and suddenly tried to be cordial.  Left wanting to go to Costco for pizza.I was really disappointed.  I read the reviews and was really excited to go here.  I got the special, which was the quail and butternut squash gnocchi.  My husband got the lamb shank with mushroom risotto. 

My quail was super dry and the gnocchi was nothing to write home about. My husbands whole dish was very bland.

The service was great, which is why I gave them 1 star.

Sorry Emeril, I really wanted to enjoy this!Restaurant 80% empty for Xmas Eve Dinner.  Bad food at outrageous price.  However, the waiter and hostess are very good and accommodating.  Pretty much agree with Monique M about the food.  Hard to imagine how bad you have to do to fuck up Italian food, but Ago's kitchen did just that.Well for one thing, from now til March you can still rent a car from Enterprise for $10 a day through the whole weekend, so that's what I would recommend. The customer service at dollar was crap, long lines, not perfect English, but my budget issue was with the vehicle. I rented a Focus with 36k miles on it, the thing shook and stalled trying to drive from 5-20 mph, so getting on highways and busy streets was quite frightening. When the car was off it made a noise under the engine that could be heard outside the car from about 30 feet away that sounded like a cassette tape being ejected from a stereo. This noise would be happening the next morning while the car was off for hours, so I'm not sure what to think or how I managed to not have a dead battery. They offered me a luxury convertible for 12 bucks more a day (which would have made my rental go from $30 to $42 and the regular price of that car was close to a hundred a day, so I prob should have gone with that lol. Like many of the other reviewers, I'm surprised this company has managed to stick around.Let me start by saying that I LOVE Cold Stone.  Then why the one star?  Well, every single time I visit the location in the Arizona Center I want to kill myself, but not before strangling the inept people behind the counter.  The main problem is that this place hires high school kids who don't give two shits about working, even though they get paid to do that.  To top it off, I am pretty sure I have never seen a manager in there, and I would hate to think they would allow a 16 year old to be a manager.  The line here is almost always ridiculously long, making the small space even more unbearable.  My worst experience was when a bunch of high school kids came after a basketball game and starting screaming to their friends working.  It was a nightmare.  Like junior high all over again.  Avoid this location at all costs.  The others are all superior.  Believe me.I went to Cadillac Ranch on Wednesday 5/8/13 with 3 friends. The reason we chose CR Tempe was because they have a great patio overlooking a stage at Tempe Marketplace where the winner of "the voice" would be singing that night. We were told it was going to be a 25- 30 min wait for the patio- not a big deal. 45 minutes later the hostess finally takes us to get seated and she tries to put us at a table on the back patio. I asked to speak to the manager (since I told her we came there solely for the good view of the stage and good service) and miraculously we were sat at a front patio table. Our server was actually great- she made sure we were taken care of and was happy we were sat in her section. To be clear-this one star review has nothing to do with her. I ordered the sliders with chipolte ranch, my friend ordered a salad with chipolte ranch, and my other friends shared the tacos. The food was pretty good and the concert was awesome. It wasn't until later that night I found out that something about my food was actually not good.Around 1:30am I woke up with a very upset gargling stomach. It wasn't long after that until I got sick. I was sick all night and only got about 3 hours of sleep. The next morning I felt a little bit better and got ready for work- since I am right out of college, every minute of work counts. I got to work at 8am and at around 9:30am my stomach started acting up and I had to leave work for the whole day. I am losing money on my next paycheck because of Cadillac Ranch. I believe they owe me a day's worth pay. I'm still only able to eat bland foods and now instead of getting together with friends tonight, I get to go home and sleep to get over this. Yay fun weekend for me.. not.  So take it from me- do not go to Cadillac Ranch for food unless you want food poisoning and your weekend to be ruined. I will not be returning anytime soon, if ever.Not that great of a job and took forever!the quote "you get what you pay for" never ran more true than while eating here. i forget the exact price of the buffet but its around $10 or so. i would have rather ate at wendy's or in n out. there are so many other places in vegas to get decent food for cheap. The food here was terrible... you remember in grade school when you had to eat that terrible disgusting horrifying cafeteria food during lunchtime? the food here is worse. Just dont do it man. gone.....My aunt found a cockroach in her salad here.

Otherwise, good selection. OK food.

Cockroach still scares me though.Ok, I have to start by telling everyone this - if you were stupid enough to agree to the timeshare presentation, and furthermore, stupid enough to buy the damn thing (like we were) - please know that YOU HAVE 5 DAYS TO GET OUT OF IT!

It was a terrible experience and ruined my vacation. My vacation that I paid TONS of money for. We were in Vegas for Memorial Day weekend on a whim as I really just needed to relax. This trip was beyond stressful thanks to these horrible people.

A guy (I think his name was Austin) in a booth in front of our hotel (TI) waved us over, asked if we were married (odd - but we are not) and offered us free show tix, etc - we were told we'd be getting a tour of a new resort for the purpose of word of mouth advertising. Had no idea this was a timeshare presentation.

1. They kept us waiting for over an hour in the lobby - I asked whether this hour+ wait time was included in the 2-3 hours we were told we would have to be here in order to receive our "free" gifts. NOPE! Should have demanded a refund and ride back to TI at this point, but we were already there (if you want an upgraded package you pay a bit and are promised tons more stuff)...
2. They had told us not to eat beforehand as we would be fed lunch as part of the tour. By the time we got there my bf was beyond starving. Buffet at the Silverton was definitely subpar.
3. Way far away from the strip. Why did I agree to buy this bs again?
4. Pushy Pushy Pushy! High Pressure. It was hell. 
5. Lots of old people here. Didn't seem very fun to make up for the distance from the strip. Reminded me of a retirement home.
6. We were there for a total of 8 hours. On Saturday. After a long drive the night before. After being told 2-3 hours. Ended up extending our hotel stay (which was super expensive) just to try to salvage our trip after this.
7. They pretty much would not let us leave as long as we kept resisting their sales pitches. Why I caved, I will never be able to reconcile with myself...
8. We had a driver take us back to the hotel at 8pm (on them luckily) as the shuttles had stopped running. I had instant buyer's remorse and vocalized this in the car. THANK GOD for this driver, I'd go back and tip her more if I could - she goes, well, I believe that by law you have 72 hours or something to get out of that. Upon getting back to the room and researching it - YES! You have 5 DAYS according to NV law. There is a cancellation form contained within the contract as well. Hallelujah!
9. We agreed to a price of I think 11k + 175/year maintenance fees. We found people selling these things on ebay for 2-3k. Yep, definitely cancelling!

Got my refund for the deposit today - thank goodness it wasn't even MORE of a pain.

You people should be ashamed!

Just remember - YOU HAVE 5 DAYS TO BAIL!Yellowtail was a big disappointment.
The only thing to rave about was the Ahi Tuna Pizza.
Everything else, was blah . . . .  nothing outstanding, nothing memorable.
Service was terrible, even though the restaurant was more than half empty.
Went there for a after show bite - 10:30pm so the restaurant wasn't crowded.
Had to repeatedly ask for water and hot tea to be refilled and got the impression that the server was too bored to be serving.
Later, back in the hotel room, saw on BellagioTV that the chef Akira Back was a prior professional snowboarder and got into being a chef to "feed himself" since pro snowboarders didn't make much money!
Well, it shows. 
The old restaurant Shintaro was way much better!  Should have kept Shintaro and ditch Yellowtail!  Bring back the jellyfish!Buyer beware, Dinner for 2 will cost you 2 HUNDRED dollars easy. If you are an average income person this place is NOT in uou r budget. Plus staff unfriendly n not knowledgeable. BEWARE shared portions , they are VERY small n cost $25 plus each n are NOT shareable. Advice, if cost is an issue, don't bother.I have written about Banfield before, but we have another saga to this ongoing problem.  I am now giving up on this stupid place and urge you guys to NEVER go there either

We have always taken our dog to Banfield Animal Hospital/Clinic in PetsMart for her vacinations and check-ups. In February of 2008, we took her again because she was acting very lethargic, her skin was very scaly, no appetite, etc. They did a blood work-up and said her Thyroid was acting up again. With all the bloodwork and office/vet visit, it cost us $450.00. Her Thyroid was high, so they gave us medication, but said we needed to come back in two weeks and have her blood tested again. We did this at least two more times.

On Sat., April 5th, our dog was very sick and would keep her tail between her legs, not eat, was extremely lethargic, would hunch her back when she would stand up, and was constipated also. All these symptoms and more were told to the vet and we were told that all these were symptoms that her Thyroid was still out of whack. By this time, it had been 2 1/2 weeks since her blood test and we were never contacted with the results. They claimed they never got the results and had to call the place that did the tests and they had to run the test again. The vet tells me she didn't have a clue as to why our dog was keeping her tail between her legs. She said our dog must be nervous. Our dog has never ever done that before. Anyway, the vet sent us home just saying all this was from the Thyroid problem.

We brought our dog home and on Sun., (April 6th) I woke up and there was blood all over the quilt my dog sleeps on. We had to take her to an Emergency Animal Clinic and found out she had burst an anal gland. They took care of that to the tune of $158.00 and immediately she was back to her normal self, which we were grateful for.. The papers said we should take her to the vet the next day, so I called Banfield, and was told I couldn't get in until this afternoon because they were full with appointments. I said I needed to get in earlier than that, so they said to come in right away. I got in there and there wasn't a soul in the place.

A different vet than we had on Saturday came in and I told her how ticked off I was at the results of Saturday's visit and then what happened on Sunday. She checked our dog and made excuses as to why the other vet did not check her bottom. I did not agree with her and told her how I felt. I told this vet that I felt I should not have to pay for this office visit and finally she agreed, so that was one good part, since we have paid close to $1,000.00 since February. The part that ticked me off the most though, was having our dog in there on Saturday and they never checked our dog in the area they should have and had no idea why her tail was between her legs and did a horrible job.

I had called PetsMart groomers to cancel our dog's haircut because of these problems and told the groomer what was going on and she asked me who the vet was and I told her Banfield. She said never to go to Banfield again. They are very bad and overcharge the customer tremendously. I can only say, do not take your dog there. They must hire their vets from the bottom of the barrel.

You should put Banfield Pet Hospital Corporation into your search engine and go to a site that shows "I'm Pissed".  You will see what this corporation has done to animals and what people think of Banfield.  Again, I'm marking one star because I have to in order to post this.Came in at about 1:00 pm on Sunday, someone came 5 minutes after us, but they took their order first, even though we were ready to order.  Even after they took the other table's order we waited another 5 minutes.  After we ordered, the food took an unusually long time to get to us.  It wasn't that busy.  When we did get our food, they messed up one of the things we ordered.  After finishing our meal we waited a while for our check and it never came.  Food was alright, but the service was absolutely terrible.  After I went up to the register to request the check, I paid for the meal and left a gratuity was appropriate based on the minimal service provided.  I mentioned this to the person that took our money, but she didn't care.  One of the worst restaurant service I've ever encountered.We just spent the week at THE Hotel and were looking forward to spending time at the pool, but only spent a few hours there during our entire stay because it was over crowded and over priced even for the Strip! After fighting for two chairs in the 115 degree heat and buying an inner-tube for $23 we were then robbed by the "Bikini Bar" for another $24 for a corona and a small pina colada! The lazy river was totally over crowded with screaming, splashing kids! 

We will definitely be back to THE Hotel but will leave the pool for the kids!!!RA is normally pretty good but damn this place is a terrible.. Sushi is dry and over cooked. It seems like it was prep the day before and depending what you order they throw it on top...never coming back. Service is good on the upsideDO NOT RENT FROM THEM!  SERIOUSLY!!

Recently, I had a painful and horrible experience from them:
1 - I was quoted online for $32.  I declined coverage but I was charged for collision damage waive fee!  Final total came to $94! 
Decline insurance or not, you still get charge for it!

While they're processing my booking, one of the front desk attendants was called in the back office to service another customer.  She came out unhappy and grumbled to the other customer that she was just getting coffee with not an ounce of friendliness in her tone and face!  Nice job, lady!  Very "professional" indeed!  

2 - They took my driver's license to make a copy but they never gave it back.

3 - Came back to the rental car to remove those "extra fees" (and to retrieve my driver's license) by "re-writing" my contract.  While the attendant is processing it, another customer beside me was having the same "wonderful" experience as I was!  The other customer was complaining about the extra fees charged.  

4 - Also tried to get my driver license back but the manager at the time was out so the Payless employees couldn't open the office door where they stored my license.  They said she'll be back around 4:30.  The employees said that no one can contact the managers if they're on a meeting (in a different building).  They tried calling but the calls were routed back to them. 
Since I couldn't risk driving without my license, I ended up waiting for the manager to come back more than an hour later (around 5:20 pm).

5 - I checked my Amex (which I used for the car rental) and I saw 4 pending transactions charged by them:
    i.  $200
    ii. $200
    iii. $ 94
    iv. $ 32

What the F!!!!!!  Where in the world did the 2 - $200 charges came from?  And since they charged $32 again when they re-wrote my contract to remove the extra insurance/coverage fees, I didn't see any pending credit transaction to refund the $94!!

I do think the employees are not treated well and respected by the management and the company.  Horrible customer service means horrible work environment, horrible management and horrible company practices (like charging extra fees!).  

With that said, I will definitely not come back to Payless LV.  If I knew at the time of the reservation that this horrible experience would happen, I would have run the other way as quick as I can.  

However, I do want to thank the lady who finally retrieved my driver's license.  She pursued the manager when she arrived to personally get it.No !!! I should have read reviews before hand !!!! bait and switch !!! I was supposed to be charge $49 and when it came down to it I was charged $375!!! Here is my previous review "mBest customer service by any car company I have ever rented from. As for Marcel, he is great!"
I take it back ! They are horrible and a rip off!Avoid this Macy's location! Was in the dressing room with my wife and daughter just minding our own business when a store employee named LESLIE came in and interrupted us with a rude condescending voice telling us that men were not allowed in the women's dressing room. Normally I'm fine with any store policy, AS LONG AS THERE IS A SIGN SO THAT I KNOW IT'S A WOMENS DRESSING ROOM! Since there was no sign, I figured it would be ok. The last thing I need is a rude employee giving us a hard time because of their lack of competence. Long story short, the wife and I left our items we were going to purchase and walked out of there. Will not be going back to Macy's.I am a regular at the good egg. Ray location on mondays and fulton ranch on tuesdays. And when Im in tucson I'll hit the speedway locaton ( Which by far has the best food!) 
 So you would think that the food would all be the same since its  franchise, but its not! the ray location food quality is 3-4star, tucson definitely 5star and Fulton ranch is the worst. so bad I refuse to go there even though its walking distance from my house.This restaurant is way over rated by its glamourized billboards and advertising.  If you're looking for great food, you will be disappointed with Simon's restaurant.  It's a confused japanese fusion/American cuisine restaurant.  It's overpriced for the quality of food they serve.  To top it off, service and management there is disastrous!  They will try to upsell you without you even knowing it...until you see your bill.  If you're out looking for quality sushis, go to shibuya..fantastic steaks, go to 9Nine steakhouse, American dining, then go to Nobhill Tavern.  Stay away from these so called "celebrity chef" defined restaurants! You'll be wasting away your money and walk away unhappy!I roll in to McFaddens after learning the Tilted Kilt is no longer in the Rio.  I have to say I was sorely disappointed by the service--they were out of Guinness--how can an Irish pub not have Guinness?  They were also out of a few entree selections and what we got was edible, but not particularly tasty.I know Italian food.  Why, because I am Italian.  I grew up eating Italian food made by my family.   My mother made her own pasta from scratch.   Now, let's get down to business.   I tried this place because of all the rave reviews.   Let me tell you this. Simply avoid this unless you enjoy cafeteria type of "Italian food" that is served in school lunch halls across the nation.  Yuck!  This guy should be ashamed of himself calling this Italian food.  Come on Yelpers and get with it.  Do me a favor.  Understand what it is to be called Italian.  It's not egg noodles with ketchup.where is this place?Took forever to get our order in. Had to retake our order after 20 minutes of waiting. Then our order was messed up again. Looks like only one person working the front. All in all, it took the server 4 tries to get our order right. No one at the table got their food at the same time so we ended up waiting even longer for everyone to finish. Service sucked. Food was average.Yeah, it's a great concept, as there are more and more people becoming vegan. They also have an extensive selection of herbs and such. The place is clean.

But the 3 most important things to me in a restaurant are: the quality of the food, the value for the price, and the service. Chakra failed on all 3 counts.

The service: awful. I waited and waited at the counter, and I was ignored, even by the woman at the register who's evidently doing some kind of accounting. Fine, I can understand the need for business processes, but she could at least have LOOKED UP and smiled and told me she'd be with me in a moment. I had to be standing there for over 5 minutes, more like 10 - and ignoring me for that long was beyond rude. Or one of the staff could have checked on me. Nope. I actually felt like I was bothering them for being there.

The food: also awful. Granted, I only went there once (but once was enough for me). I  forget exactly which one I ordered, it was some sort of wrap or burrito. It sounded really good on the menu - a delicious mix chock-full of greens and various crunchy veggies. Well, I got to my car and took a few bites and gave up. It was almost entirely some sort of greens with very paltry portions of other vegetables (a couple of string-like shreds of celery) - I actually opened it up in my car to look for them. What made it even worse was that the greens were wet, and the whole thing was water-logged and the tortilla got soaked through. And there was absolutely ZERO seasoning! Appalling. Disgusting and unacceptable. I threw it out.

The value: I cannot believe I paid $13 for this piece of garbage. Not only that, it was supposed to come with a side of salsa, and wouldn't you know it, it did not. It's rare for me to get so angry about an establishment, and I would have returned it had I not been on the go & headed to an appointment.Went to DM a few weeks ago with my mom.  I was kinda of excited...I mean...a WHOLE STORE dedicated to the preggos!?!  Where can you go wrong?

I'll tell you where you can go wrong....if you're a plus size preggo.  Forget it.  For being a plus size gal, I'm very proportionate.  And all of my weight has shifted.  Where there wasn't much of a tummy before with a small waist....HELLO BABY BUMP!  

This stores Plus Size section is a joke.  Here's a rack about 5ft long, in total, for you to find clothes from.  And forget about them being cute.   I should have known MY clothes selection would be anorexic especially seeing the location - N. Scottsdale(haha...that was kinda funny...anorexic...n.scottsdale....teehee).    Anywho.

Can you say - Catering to the demographics??  All together now....

The only positive thing to come about was Edamame Spa  - The spa place tucked in the corner.  Found out lots of information on what to use on my skin and about getting prenatal massages.I have been a CVS customer for years, I moved close to this pharmacy, Honestly at first the pharmacy techs upset me but now I am used to the awkward lack of customer service. I am happy that after months of asking they now apply my 25 dollar discount card. Well I don't take no for an answer anymore, I could change locations but [why I am having laser surgery done to my back so hopefully I will not need to go there every month.  Maybe try another place, But if it is best for you, Just stand your ground.

***update*** I dropped
This place. The jerks finally pushed me over
The edge months ago. I moved
My scripts over to Walmarts pharmacy . I have not had an issue since.This is what you call a "clown factory."Very mediocre. Based on a few different experiences,  I don't think any all you can eat sushi places can be that good.  The last place that i tried had rolls that were as chewy as id imagine a car tire would be. This wasn't that bad, but I heard people get sick here. I wish I had been told before I ate! Hopefully I won't get sick...

We ordered a lot of sushi and all of it was pretty  "...meh" they also never brought our order of edamame. Our service was pretty rude, overall. The employees looked like they hated working there. The mango ice cream was okay.

Honestly, between the college age crowd, the quality of the food and the decor, I felt like I was eating in a university cafeteria. I would not have gone here to eat of my own accord, had i not been treated to it. Hopefully I'll find some good food while visiting Canada because this wasn't it.

**Update:I wasn't aware at the time, but the business is pretty shady. My friends split the bill with cash and credit card and they were overcharged $50 and had to drive back to get it fixed! After some arguing, I believe everything was resolved. What a hassle. 

After talking to some other locals about this place, I noticed most people cringe after hearing "Ye's sushi" This place is really not recommended by anybody. Why did we go here then? 

I hear a place called Sushi 99 is much better and is very close to this restaurant.The customer service phone numbers are terrible, hold times very long, aging 747 fleet on the PHX-LHR route means frequent delays for technical reasons.  Used to be my favorite airline, now I'd rather fly with anyone else. Huge restrictions on using Avios points, then tiny seats with limited seat pitch.  As I type this I have been on hold to speak to an agent for 30+ minutes.  Time for them to go out of business and let a customer-centric airline take over these routes.

UPDATE: It finally took me TWO HOURS on the phone to make a change to my flight working with an agent, constantly being placed on hold.  HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE customer service!!!  If there was a way to award ZERO STARS I would do it!!!some of the worst service ever, half an hour almost to finally get my drink order so needless to say, ruined the meal.would not recommend because of thatWhoah.

It was insane.... 

but not the type I might ever wish on someone.  

More like Jacob's Ladder...

the crowd was a wreck.  The inside of the place on the bigscreen outside would drive off anyone.... freaky freaking of wasted people falling down and dressed like.... terrible, terrible dressers.  All sizes four sizes too tight.  ALL.. .men and women.

Very not cool.  Made me very undude.

You want to participate in the destruction of the world club scene through bottle service... yeah... thanks. 

anyhoo... expensive and dumb.  Stay away.Well I have been to this place several times in the past.  The past is where my visits will stay.   Visited one last time, got sick and the portion size has gone from too much food to a 3 forkful amount of sides.  Too bad for Changing Hands Book Store- hope their business keeps up in spite of the bad food being served next door.I've regularly used this company for a couple years now in the Tucson area. The last several times have been disappointing (long wait times, dirty cars), but not prohibitively so--until last night. I used the Taxi Magic app on my phone to book, the map said the driver was 3 miles away. The cab took over 30 minutes to get to me. Not only did I suspect that the driver had been drinking due to his slurred speech, but he had a friend in the passenger seat that was so drunk he ended up passing out. First he told me that he was "taking his friend to the casino", then later said that they had just come from the casino. Either way, it's unnerving to get in a cab with two men at four in the morning when you're a small girl; completely unacceptable behavior on the driver's part. Will never be using again.I was excited to come to this bar because of their great beer selection.  When I walked in I asked if there was a beer list.   The bartender pointed and said, "It's on the board behind you."  I thought it was a strange response, since the board only had the beers that were on tap, but we ordered from that list.  My boyfriend and I both received dirty looks for our beer choices, and the bartender reluctantly got them.

While we sat at the bar a man approached the bar ordering for himself and a few friends.  Normally they drank macro brews, so they needed a recommendation of what to get.  The bartender condescending judged their normal beer preferences and told them what was closest to what they drank.  When the man came back up to order a second round of beers the bartender sighed at him and made a face of annoyance.

While drinking my beer I noticed there was a book someone had that listed the beers available in bottles.  Funny because this is what I requested and was not given when I walked in.  When the man was done with the book he let me have it.  My next beer selection then came from the book.  Once I got my second beer my boyfriend and I moved to table in order to get away from the bartender.

Shortly after moving to a table, a group of the bartender's friends came in.  He served them and grabbed a beer for himself.  Then he sat with them at the tables.  After we finished our beers we walked back up to the bar and stood there thinking the bartender would come back to the bar, since he had patrons with empty beers standing up there.  Plus there were 2 other people sitting at the bar with empty beers.  Clearly he didn't care once he had his friends to hangout with.  At that point I decided to walk over and let him know that I wanted to close out my tab, and then he finally cared for closing out my tab.

After having such horrible service I refused to come back.  No amazing beer selection could make up for that.We were completely disappointed with our food. Flavorless, overpriced and measly portions of gristly proteins. We definitely won't be going back. Worst Thai food I've had in Vegas to date.Good location, nice decor, nice staff, terrible food. I ate here recently and was decidedly disappointed; from the menu it looked as though the food would be lovely. I had smoked salmon and cream cheese pate which was much more cheese than pate, then a very interesting take on enchiladas which unfortunately was the kind of standard I'd expect in McDonalds. My boyfriend had duck and orange pate which was horrible; he only ate half of it. He then had steak, which he said was nice but the crevettes it came with were mushy and very over-cooked, and the mashed potato with was dry and crumbly - he said it reminded him of the sort of potato you'd get at school. He thought it'd had all been left under a heat lamp as it was so dry. We were discussing how it had been so busy and the only conclusion that we came to was that it's in a tourist trap. I don't think this place gets a lot of repeat business. 

My advice if you're looking for somewhere nice for dinner in this area is to go to Maison Bleue on Victoria St, or The Outsider on George IV Bridge.Why oh why have you led so far astray yelp!?  This hole in the wall restaurant was to be a great secret delicious place, instead it turned out that it was a filthy hovel with terrible starch to fill the belly.  Waiters with foul yellow stains from their own food eating misadventures, meat sitting in unrefridgerated counters and a dining room that resembled the boiler room from a b horror film.  The food was not cheap in comparison to some amazing restaurants we enjoyed at lunch such as mussel and steak just a short walk away. I know this is supposedly a good place for university students but I would gladly go back to Ramon noodles and fluorescent Mac and cheese.  They seat you at a dingy table while you contemplate running out before someone notices you and then man with a untucked shirt with stains and an unkempt beard asks for your order. The smell of stale food and dry spices fill the nostrils and then the food arrives. Rice that's lukewarm and veggies straight from the freezer in spices to hide the freezer burn taste. Singed bread that is cool as well and soon you wonder if all they have in the kitchen is a freezer, a toaster and an old microwave. The bill is not printed out but rather shown to you on a calculator... Hmm I wonder why... Do yourself a favor and call the health inspector on this Burke and Hare show they call an Indian restaurant. RunThe highlight of our visit here has to be the lengthy typed 'banned list' on the wall. 

There is so much to say about this place, so let me start with the positives...
- The characters inside seem lovely, this is clearly their second home but they have such a lovely sense of community with they darts and dominoes club.
- When Joe and I walked in we didn't feel unwelcome despite the fact that we stuck out like a saw thumb.
- The drinks are unbelievably cheap, £1.70 for a vodka lime and soda.
- Although we didn't try any, they had a small food menu, rolls for 90p and a burger for about £1.70.

However, there are many negatives...
- It was close to 100°c inside.
- Smelled like an old people's home.
- Generally a bit manky.
- It was like an old men's social club, not somewhere a 26 year old female really fits in!

So overall, if you are an old man who wants to sit in the pub all day with some friends, then this is the place for you!I just want to update in response to the "owners" note. This in fact is a legit review, I visited the spa in March and had this exact experience and if your records do not reflect that you have yet another issue.

Just as a lesson I would encourage you to reach out and try to answer issues politely, all in all this isn't a horrible review, I likely would have given it another chance. Now though you've made the matter worse and my decision will never change and I will absolutely not be returning.

One last update, if I'm not in your system why did you email me a birthday special this month? Oh and this is after I've opted out of your mailing list.

All around bad business happening at this place. AVOID!Good food, but witnessed the grill chef use tongs to put a raw piece of chicken on the grill and use the same ones to pull a cooked one and put it on a sandwich. MAJOR NO NO IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY! Some times its not good for a restaurant to have an open kitchen. I've have managed restaurants in my life and is why I noticed this. I informed the manager and he handled the situation properly. Unfortunately this is something I had to report to the public, so this can be looked at by corporate and handled ,so hopefully someone doesn't get sick. P.s. there marzen beer is very good. Eat at your own risk.OK yogurt, way too expensive. Yogurtini in Tempe has been my favorite. Only .39 cents an ounce. Better toppings and yogurt was definitely better.Don't bother staying here.  The resort fees are outrageously high and you get no value for them.  The collection of slots is sorely lacking and the tables are mediocre at best.  You're better off at a real hotel a little further down the strip.I will never, ever, ever go back here again. My purse was stolen. Shows you what type of people frequent there. No thanks.The line here is super long and the drive through is deceiving.  I do enjoy the red velvet munchkins and their sausage breakfast sandwich is definitely eatable.  The problem here is that they get your order wrong nearly every single time.I am in total agreement with Lily A.  This was one of the worst meals we have ever had.  An article in the AZ Republic quoted the owner as saying that this "food goes down pretty well with the university crowd."  God...I hope they spend their money on beer instead.  I think even grade school cafeterias don't serve this kind of dreck anymore. The fomerly frozen, poured-out-of-a-giant-bag fish was about 1/4" thick and tasteless.  They charge $1.55 for an extra piece.  It's worth maybe 50 cents if you happen to find 2 quarters in your car's ashtray.The small handful of fries was cold, limp and shriveled--maybe the owner can invest in a heat lamp with all the money he is saving on buying cheap, glorified fish sticks. And they charge extra for tartar sauce.  The meal came with 2 red mystery sauces that remained unopened and were dumped in the garbage.  How about giving the customer a choice of 1 sauce and not charging them for it?
Decor was drab, tables were dirty and there was food stuck in the cushions of the booth along the wall. Yuk!! I live in the neighborhood and I say never again!Long story short STAY AWAY from this gym.  Worst gym/customer service I have ever experienced. -5 starsHow this place stays in business is beyond me. 

They are run by a rude person that overcharges for everything in the store. 

Avoid this place and head to a Babies R us.Very unhappy with Aria hotel in Las Vegas. Spent 5 nights there and the service overall was terrible. The steak restaurant was good and the blackjack dealers were good, everything else sucked. The hours the Guest Services has is like bank hours and the front desk management is poor. They kept us about 40 minutes checking out and we missed our flight. When i called them and told them about the situation the manager actually said she would charge me the pending amount on our card even though she already gave us a zero balance. I would not recommed it to anyone.I know I know,it was memorial weekend and whole las Vegas was packed.....but I made a reservation around 3weeks ago, and they juz ignored my request of 2queen beds room. Giving me a king size bed with a add-on twin bed instead. Tht room costs 560+tax.....my fds and I juz didn't feel good and not quite acceptable.... Worst???? The add-on bed was standing against he wall when we got in....then we asked them to set it, we checked it 4hrs later(around 1 am) and it was till standing up. Paying extreme high price to receive this kind of service in a five stars hotel just doesn't make sense and all I can say is disappointing.This review is only for the casino.  Hubby and I came by to spend some gambling bucks to earn some comps.

We stopped at a couple of slot machines to relax and build our points cause who knows?  Maybe we want to stay here someday?

I asked hubby why is it so noisy in here?  It sounds like there is a full casino of people, though it was empty.  Weird. 

My husband said they probably pipe in the crowd noise.

Back to the machines.  We each put in our cards and a hundred in each machine.  

25 cent machines.   My max bet  was around 9 bucks.  

My hubby?  $90 dollar max bet wth? 

No indication on the machine our fault maybe but WHO makes $90 dollar bets on a quarter machine?  


We grabbed our cards and cashed out and went back to our hotel, PH where we could try our luck without being reamed the minute we walk in. 


Sorry Aria, we wanted to like you but you seem really fake to us even for VegasThis place is a joke, an absolute disgrace, and the epitome of why we locals do not frequent the strip. They take your money and give you nothing in return. The excellence and luxury are a facade and standards are almost non-existent with no concern for consequence, they are, of course, "The Aria on the Las Vegas Strip!" Yet another production house. People will continue to come here and let them financially violate them and then go home and tell stories of how terrible Las Vegas is. Thank you for your great contribution to Las Vegas tourism Aria Hotel and Casino. We weren't even here for 12 hours, most of which was spent trying to sleep, before I had so many unbelievably negative things to say about our experience that I didn't even want to write a review just so I could stop focusing on all the bad and try and enjoy the rest of my Staycation if possible. It's not even necessary to go into details, stay here at your own risk, or lower your expectations.worst food i have ever had! enter to a horrible musty smell. sit down and the waiter says "don't order the ground beef anything, customers say it is spoiled and rancid tonight"!  the kitchen is still selling it?? food comes out cold, beans equaled 2 tablespoons and rice was hard as a rock.  meals were: 1 taco w/rice and beans, 1 taco w/rice and beans and 2 tacos w/rice and beans, 1 water, one beer, one coke= $55.80! not only will i never return, but contacted the board of health!If it was a year ago I would have given them 5 stars.

If I could give them zero stars I would. Well on second thought, 1 star for the memory of what they used to be. They used to be AWESOME.

What the heck happened? Mind you, it's been awhile now. Maybe I was there the end of last year 2010. There is a reason I haven't been back since then. We didn't want a repeat of the horrible time we had there. 

I was actually a big fan. Dropping 30 bucks a pop every time I went in. Taking my son there after school. Pretty regular to the point of actually caring enough to sign their wall.

I had been raving about this place for months to my father in law so I took everyone out to eat there. I was a regular as was my son. We always get certain things. The combo I think it's called with the loose meat on the hot dog.

Well I think ownership has changed and service is the dumps. It was so bad none of us have been back for a year now. If ownership hasn't changed then they had two new people trying to work the counter.

There were a couple of people in front of us. So I knew it would be a bit of a wait. We stood in line for 45 minutes an the line never moved. Nope...not one person. I don't know what happened behind the counter because none of us got an explaination! 

I kept telling my father in law..."it's just a bad day but hang in there because the food is awesome, I promise!" It got to be an hour and we moved up one spot in the line when I heard the people say to those in front of us....

Sorry we're out of loose meat.

What???? Can you AT LEAST tell the entire line of people who have been standing there for that long that you don't have what you're KNOWN FOR????? It would have saved us a whole lot of headache. We left to eat someplace else. We had not eaten all morning on purpose so we would be ravenous so we could feast on loose meat burgers and combos.

Now when we hear anyone mention this place we roll our eyes and say...."rememeber the time we..."

It could have ended so much better if the staff had any talent for customer service. It's pretty understandable to anyone if you're standing in a no moving line for an hour and find out what you're there for is not available you're going to be pretty @#$ pissed when  no one bothers to mention half the menu is unavailable(there was something else they were out of but cannot remember what it was). Yeah. Probably pissed enough to not go back for a while. Yup.

I may go back in a few months to see how they are doing, but honestly I'm having a good time stuffing my face around the corner at that chicago hot dog stand called "Hotdog Heaven". It's pretty awesome.

I'm totally willing to go back someday but it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth so it will be a bit longer. I'm just having a much better experience at other places right now.

=================================

Geez, what's with my reviews lately. Everything has been less than 3 stars! Is it a sign of the times? Location? Or the luck of thedraw? lol Well I'm determined to write a good one coming up soon as I'll be staying at the Golden Nugget soon on a staycation this summer! Yay! High hopes.Disgusting, tried multiple items and the only fresh product they serve is the "Pete's Sauce". You're better off buying a fry daddy and some frozen fish to make at home... Also, don't even think of using your debit or credit card to purchase anything; cash only. If you forget to bring cash they'll let you use their ATM, if you don't mind the convenience fee. Don't waste your time with this place.I went to Cafe Mix today with my mother and friend for the first time. WE WILL NOT BE GOING BACK. The male manager at the ordering station was arrogant and unaccomodating. We asked for a "to go" cup for our iced
 tea and he said "they don't do that". However, during my meal I noticed 2 other customers walk out with a "to go" cup. When my gyro was served to me by the overly tanned female server, I kindly showed her my receipt that I had paid for a side of the cucumber sauce and didn't receive it. Her exact reply was "you'll get it"! The gyro sandwich was very greasy. Sandwiches do not come with a side. Next time we crave greek food, we will go across the parking lot to Bellagio's next door.We visited my wife's aunt in Vegas. She insisted we go to this bar and grill for dinner. What a disappointment. 2 of us ordered the fish and chips after being assured by the server that this was "Excellent". Apparently his definition of excellent is the same as my definition of horrible. It was frozen cod in batter about 3/8 inch batter top and bottom and so hard you could use it as a sanding block. 

You would think that I could have let the server know, but we didn't see him until he delivered the check about 25 minutes later. I have 1 suggestion for him. It looks like you hate your job, go find one where you don't have to work with the public. Maybe he just didn't like working.

My wife had the patty melt. At least that was edible, but nothing to rave about. I can easily say that I will never return to this establishment.It was around 6:30 on a Friday when my husband was trying to find something quick to get just before our plane was going to board.  This place was close to our gate and had a vegetarian option.  Normally, we enjoy Mexican food and I find it pretty hard to screw up.  Until we got a veggie burrito from here, that is.

They were getting ready to close (who closes at 6:30?), so maybe that had something to do with it.  The burrito had some kind of off peanut buttery taste to it, and despite the fact that I was starving, I managed to only eat a couple bites before giving up.

I would say no to this place, unless your super pressed for time and ready to pass out from hunger.Overall a pathetic and weak excuse for a Gyro. 
The pita was slightly stale and chewy and there was so little meat here that it was lost in the pita, I feel cheated.
The tzatziki sauce truly ruined it for me, it was unusually sweet and off putting, I've never tasted anything like it.The customer service for the general area is great. The pharmacy however is a different story. The chick said my daughters meds would be done in one hour... It's almost two hours now and I went to the same guy when I got here and he had acted as if he didn't know I had been waiting !..stopped in here on a whim to get the boyfriend a haircut n shave. they did a great job. and for me sitting and waiting was great...each station has a tv with sportscenter on it. 
however, we didn't have an issue until one of the barbers comes out from his break. he sat in his stations chair, texting and and then started talking shit to one of the other barbers. it was completely unprofessional and made me extremely uncomfortable and I wasn't even getting the one getting my hair did! what's worse is this kid instigated it with the African American employee and then when I glared at him long enough hoping he'd shut up..it appeared he got my message and then he tried to calm things down. Maybe he figured out I was writing this review about him. I hope he's fired..the one who started the shit talking. He clearly has no respect for customers, his fellow coworkers or this barbershop.So disappointed! 
My guy and I love Thai (rhymes, cool). 
We ordered the traditional Phad Thai with shrimp and the Ruby Red Curry with chicken. 
We picked it up and brought it home. The first thing I noticed was that there was no shrimp in the Phad Thai. We called and they said that we were not charged for shrimp...ok but I ordered shrimp and that is what I wanted. 
The worst part should have been the easiest. The white rice that accompanied the curry was beyond mushy. It didn't even look like rice. It completely ruined the entire dish for me. The curry flavor was OK but I could not get past the super mushy rice. 

Looks like the hunt for good Thai take out continues...Yuck! I had a chicken wrap and it was very dry!!! Chicken seemed like it was frozen before and it was burnt!  Service was ok and the booth is sat in was very broken in! I had to sit on the wooden bar in the middle so I didn't sink in! The long island iced tea was very stiff!Overpriced, dirty, how do people waste their money there? Food sucks!I ordered the Hawaii BBQ chicken and after consuming half of the food, I found a long black hair at the bottom of the plate... Totally disgusted me, I will never eat there again.  I filed a complaint with the Health Department..There are way better original italian places to go...I promiseThis is like every other cookie cutter trying to be cool coffee place out there except with really terrible (and I sincerely mean this) music. Downtown Kitchener has so many other wonderful places to get coffee. In my opinion you should skip this place.....just keep walking.horrible. thank god it was comped dinner still it was not good at allExtremely rude hostesses informed us that there weren't any tables available at 9pm on a Thursday night - what kind of place doesn't have any tables available for walk-ins? 

That said, the menu looked pedestrian (think Mesa grill, more expensive) so I'd skip it.

That, or wait until the hostesses are switched out.WHAT THE F*CK.

The portions here are TINY.  Yes, I know this is an upscale place but still.  You really need two or three entrees to feel full.  Our server said the sides were big enough to share.. not really sure what he was talking about because these were also super tiny.  My seared tuna was literally three little tuna ovals.  I wanted to ask where the rest of it went.

The menu is very boring also.  There is nothing risky about it.  You would think for such a nice place they would offer something a little more daring.  Nope.

You can find MUCH better places in Vegas for cheaper.  Hell, the all you can eat buffet was better than this place and half the price.  So yeah, I would not recommend this place.

Got a huge ice cream right after leaving.Horrible buffet! Not a really big selection. You would think since the buffet is inside Aria it would be at least decent but I was wrong. Don't waste your money here.... I would've been a lot more happier if I just got a burger from McDonald's or something!!Terrible. I will never go again. Ever!! Lunch special is cheap because the every shrimp dish has only 3 pieces of shrimp. They are skimping and food is overly greasy and way too salty. Plus the people are rude.Called ahead.  Lost our name.  Waited an hour.  Placed in budiest table next to kitchen.  Staff disorginized and screeming above our table.  Mix up on wine.  Took 50 minutes to receive cold food. 4 star prices at 1 star service.  Never againThis is nuts. We got into line and ordered sandwiches. We moved forward and asked for soup. The soup guy was a bit rude and told us we should have already ordered soup. We got to the cashier and ordered our drinks. She took our money and told my son that he needed to go back to the front of the line and they would make his drink. His drink took another 15 minutes. We had our food, we had our table and my son spends another 15 minutes to get his drink. It would be so much easier if they had a person at the front if the line taking orders. Food was great. The bizarre ordering process gets this place one star.I know all about the e.coli outbreak, I was a victim of it stay farrrrr away from this place. I thought I was going to DIEDIRTY, DIRTY, DIRTY!!!!

We should have known immediately that this place was going to be gross by the garbage littering the walkway to the front door.
The raw meat is left out in the open at room temperature marinating next to other ready to eat food. Sketchy, but it was on ice so we decided to go for it. Our waitress was pretty rude, and she seemed to want to hurry us through the entire meal. Everytime we got up for more of the buffet, she turned off our table side bbq pit, as if to convey that we were done, when we were not. We ate and left, only to spend the evening in our hotel room with FOOD POISONING. 

Absoulutely horrible restaurant. The service needs a lot of attention and the food needs to be cared for in a clean, proper way. One star because it really is so disgusting.  :o(When it's 11:30 pm and me so hungry... I need a burrito call.

Amando's Bros. sounded like it might satisfy my hungriness but this late night burrito call left me with regret.

The carne asada burrito was COLD. I had both hands wrapped on a cold burrito. It was such a turn off. I also had the carne asada fries that were equally disappointing. It was covered in cheese and the fries tasted like it was fried in lukewarm oil. It was not crispy or crunchy, just stale and old tasting. 

The next time I am feeling an itch for a burrito late at night... I will have to pass on Amando's Bros. La comida es no bueno.I called this company on 12/8/11 & a gentleman answered the phone with a "Hello". I thought I had reached someone's house by accident. The gentleman I spoke with was named "Ron" (I believe). I asked Ron about his anti allergen product "Responsible Care", Ron didn't really want to focus on my question, but more about him being the best technician out there & how most others are a scam by switching products out etc etc... When he was finished his long story on other companies scamming people & how it was the technician behind the cleaning & not the product or equipment that made the carpet clean, I asked respectfully "not to be demeaning, but how much can different techniques between techs make a difference. Isn't it really just moving a cleaner across a carpet or floor"? After all his ranting (about 5min worth) on how much the technician affected the cleaning, I thought that would be a legitimate question. The next thing I knew Ron told me "I don't have time for this, goodbye" then hung up on me! I want to be clear I have not used this company, but Ron was far from professional on the phone throughout our conversation & then hanging up on me after he became offended by my question??? If this guy is the best out there, it would be hard to get past his sales technique to try him out as he comes across as a loose cannon, from the unprofessional way he answered the phone, to hanging up on me & not answering my question. If you decide to use this company, I hope the job itself is much better than his sales pitch/question answering skills...Good luck!!If I could give this place zero stars I would. The service does suck. My friend and I walk in and no one greets us. We stand there for a few minutes and no one comes to seat us. We eventually ourselves at the bar and still nothing - not even the sushi chefs say hi. Are we ghosts? Eventually a waitress comes over with utensils but by that time my friend is done and we just leave. 

Come on people, how do you expect to run a successful business this way? My god!Yuck! The teriyaki chicken did not look or taste like chicken. The price for the portion size was too damn high.Went here with a party of 11 a few months ago for Sunday brunch. Yes, we were prepared for a long wait on a Sunday morning, but were excited when we were told the wait would be 15 minutes. It ended up taking over an hour and a half after the hostess admittedly seated another party of 11 before us. The frustrating part was that there were at least 5-6 tables free and they wouldn't push them together for us. We asked several times if we could split our party to make the wait shorter, and they insisted  we not do that. Things took a downward turn when the manager loudly and openly raised his voice with my stepdad in front of the entire restaurant. Really not cool. We won't be back.The only reason this place is getting one star is because I can't give them ZERO stars. First of all, they told me they couldn't get me in for a gel manicure for 45 minutes (which I didn't have) so I was going to leave and he says "actually, no we can squeeze you in." Well I went and sat down and their way of "squeezing me in" was by having me soak my nails for 35 minutes! When the nail tech finally say down, she didn't even say hello, just yanked my hand out of the bowl and started filing. Finally I go sit at the painting/UV light area and I notice my cuticle is bleeding. Awesome. She gives me the color wheel to pick my color and starts getting impatient because I didn't make my choice in 5 seconds. Then she literally turns to the side and spits her gum about 2 feet into the garbage. Disgusting!!! So the color I told her I wanted was a light pink, I ended up with a darker pink but did not want to waste time having to start over. Whatever. I asked for 4 thin gold stripes on my ring finer which she did (took her about 10 seconds on each finger). I go up to pay and the gel mani they charge $25 for, well the guy tells me my total is $43!!!!! I was shocked and he said "For the design." That comes out to almost $2 per tiny stripe!!!! Absolutely ridiculous!!! I will NEVER step foot in that salon again and I strongly recommend that you don't either. I'd rather drive the extra couple miles into Gilbert and get quality service at a fair and reasonable price. STAY AWAY FROM TIPS AND TOES!!!!!If I could've given this review a half a star I would have. I'm a local in Las Vegas,  friends were in town and we wanted to do something fun with them. Decided to try a comedy show with burlesque, big mistake. It starts from lining up outside where some hack who thinks He's a comedian, who's really a glorified doorman, starts yelling obscenities at you about the rules of the club. Not appreciated. We went Saturday, April 19. Whoever the comedians were that night were awful and I mean awful. We bought VIP seating, that was our first mistake. Not worth the price. Very small room, every seat is close enough to the stage, save your money.  You would think with VIP seats and the extra money spent it would include at least one drink. Wrong, you are forced to buy at least one drink, water $4.  Some VIP tables were offered popcorn, others including ours were not....go figure.  Again comedians, 2 of them,  were pitiful. Dancers were good, but the whole thing didn't seem to blend well. MC was desperately trying to hold the crowd together, tough job to do with bad acts.  Try Brad Garrett's comedy club, never had a bad evening there.  If you really insist on going, get your tickets on Groupon $10 ea but don't say I didn't warn you.I didn't get a chance to try the food here but Yelp won't let me post a review without any stars so I choose one because I looked forward to trying this restaurant but when I got there I couldn't go inside because they have a "no firearms" sign posted prominently . Since both of us in our party take our own personal safety seriously by carrying concealed firearms we went somewhere else to eat. 

Good way to turn away customers but at least we discovered Pita Jungle, the food there was great and no silly "No Firearms" signs to turn away law abiding customers. 

Seriously, do you think a person intent on robbery or mayhem would heed those signs?Service is terribly slow. Orders have never been correct. Manager Oscar is trained in a third world country. I have boycotted this location for the last year and I live and work within walking distance of this place. I'd much rather go out of my way and give my money to the Boca Park location.Don't go to them unless you want to overpay and have your things ruined. See details under Mobile Mini Tempe, the main office.negative stars abound.

I receive an ontrac delivery note on my mailbox.  1st attempt delivery.  I called them to change the address so my order ships to my office.  The woman took down the new address and told me i needed to call amazon and authorize the address change.  i get off the phone with her, i call amazon, i explain the need to change the address and they conference call in a representative from ontrac who confirmed that the new address and that they would deliver to my office and not my home.  I do not receive the package the next day.  I come home to find a second delivery attempt notice on my mailbox from ontrac.  

After specifically asking and confirming the new address this second delivery attempt seems ridiculous. It also seems ridiculous that their pick up location is in SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO nowhere near public transportation.

I'm ready to have them return my order to Amazon so I can have it delivered via UPS.Ordered a package from Amazon on 09/02/11 the delivery date was set for 09/06/11 the tracking said no gate code.  Excuse me my complex is very small about 8 townhouses and no electronic gates.  This is the 2nd time this company has done something shady.  I will write Amazon today and let them know how incompetent this company really is.  Ontrac is HORRIBLE!  -10 StarsUgh.  The tracking info on their site says "Delivered", yet we've been home all day and no package.  I called and they are trying to locate the package.  This is the first time I've ever had a delivery problem ordering from Amazon.
Last time I ever willingly use OnTrac!!!Yes, it's cheap but cheap does not have to equal disgusting. 

This food was GROSS and obviously had been left out for a while.

Believe me,  I love greasy, Americanized chinese food but this was beyond anything I've ever tasted. Not fresh. Lettuce at salad bar looked wilted so I tried most of the chicken dishes, chow mein and rice and was not a happy camper. 

Everything just tasted like it had been re-heated after having been left out at least a day. 

Service was non-existent, I went during lunch and there were probably 2 or 3 other families besides mine so not sure what the problem was.

I really wanted to like this place as it close to home but hey there a zillion other buffets like this to settle for this one! Next....I had "reservations" at 1.  Was told I needed to check in before 1:15 or I would lose the reservation.  Like a true (but sorry) Cardinals fan I checked in at 12:45, 1:00, 1:15, etc.  Each time I was told that the 10:00 o'clock game was still finishing up or that the tables were being cleared for seating which to some degree I understand.  What I don't understand in a place that is that busy, number 1 doesn't have a system for seating people and number 2 has nowhere for folks to sit in the lobby to wait to have their name called.  Which would be nice but my name was never called.  What ended up happening was there was a carousel of very furious folks with "reservations" that kept going up to the hostess podium once the previous game cleared out.  Being frustrated enough and actually having a hostess come back from the dining room stating that a table was open seemed to be the prerequisite to being seated.  I was told my name was going to get called and I stood for a long time in front of the podium and ultimately sat on the floor till I saw every single angry customer with a reservation complain and get seated as soon as there was a clean table.  I was in no mood to complain in a civil fashion so I figured I would wait till my name was called my reservation and my repeated check ins had to count for something.  It didn't my name was never called.  What did happen was I was asked while I was sitting on the floor what my name was again.  I spelled it out and was asked again.  For a place that had me check in three times out of their flawed process to ask me my name put me over the edge.  I shut down and luckily for me my wife spoke up and spelled out our name.  We were then immediately called once we could verify that we knew our own name and could spell it.  The best part being that they sat us down with the game I had reserved no where in site.  When I asked about it I was initially told they couldn't do anything about the tv's in that area but ultimately I tv above my head where I had to crane my neck was set to the Cardinals game.  It gets one set of service stars better though folks.  There are three areas to sit in.  The nice big game tiered seating which is 100 dollars per person minimum, the standard seating which is 50 per person minimum, and the communal area which is 25 minimum per person.  Not till I left did I figure out I never got my own tv and I saw the seating we should have had if it was the standard 50 per person seating.  I spent 100+ on some decent food but horrible service had I known where I was seated I would had a pretzel and a drink.  Don't go here unless you like to be treated like you are less than nothing when you plan on spending something.  I was seated in the middle of the second quarter and the Cards lost to the Steelers btw.AGGRESSIVE BOUNCERS!

The place would be a nice hangout if it weren't for the overly aggressive security guards.  My wife and I were hanging out with a couple of friends this weekend.  We were pretty much keeping to ourselves at the patio and hand one of these power hungry jerks decided we had to leave.  He asked me wife if she was ok while we were seated at a table.  She turned to him and said yes and went back to her conversation.  He said 'you're out of here" for no good reason.  I said hold on, what's the problem so I had to go too. The guy did everything he could to antagonize me, too.  After starting a loud argument with the little jerk, he got his bouncing buddies to quickly rush us out of the door with no explanation.  They were really aggressive about it, and pretty much pushed the ladies out.  My wife tripped while they were rushing us out and actually fell in the pool.  This guy was just a GOON looking for trouble and using his pay nothing job as an excuse to exert his minimal authority.  And from the other reviews on Yelp, this is not rare for this place..  BEWARE OF THESE BOUNCING LOSERS!

Also, when I managed to get the waitress to come over so I could pay our bill, she said this was pretty typical for the bouncers and rolled her eyes.

Well, they just lost a customer.  I would NEVER pay another dime and will make sure none of my friends ever go here again either.I asked for an Americano with a small amount of dark chocolate -- shaved, pump, powder, I don't care -- whatever is easiest for you, although I was hoping they would pride themselves on having high quality, very dark, freshly shaved chocolate.  I was told they won't make it.  Not "can't" because they don't have chocolate, but "won't" because they know better than I what I should be drinking.

And this from people who put honey in coffee.

I will not be back.I bought my first MINI a week ago at MINI of Las Vegas, car seems fine so far, but it will be the last car I will buy from this dealership.
Cameron, sales person was very nice, telling me exactly what I wanted to hear, 0% financing, great value for my trade in, upgraded rims included! sounded great.
But none of that was true, but I liked the car I was buying, so I stayed with it, I got a deal I could live with after dealing with Scott, sales manager, so I went through with the purchase"
The dealership was running a promotion of pay $1000 and we will match $1000 that I had to ask for, this took the price of the vehicle and payments to where I would like to be.
When I took delivery of the car, 7 hours after I came in, I wanted a walk through of the features of the vehicle, I was then told to read the manual, as it was getting late and everyone wanted to go home for the day.
Cameron scheduled me for a follow up appointment 6 days later, where I was supposed to get the rims I was promised, a missing key, and the missing manual, when I showed up as scheduled, Cameron didn't even remember me, why I was there, or even that we had a appointment?? 
I found Scott the sales manager and he assisted with getting the missing key, the manual will be shipped in the mail, and the rims was ready 2 days later.
I still have not had my walk through of the car, but I'll rather do that myself at home once I receive the manual.
There has not been a follow up by the dealership after purchase, no check for customer satisfaction, so I'll do that here on Yelp so they can read it here.
I can honestly say, you got my business this time, but not the next time, nor will I recommend your dealership to anyone, the car is fine, fun to drive, but the way you treat your customers is enough for me to not go back.
And no, if your reply to this review, is to call your GM, I will not do that, just ask your sales person Cameron, if he remembers!!He is so funny on TV but in person it wasn't very good at all.  Most of what he did was old material, and he had this strange inside joke going with the band.  It was as if he really didn't care whether the audience laughed or not.  I'm out $80....live and learnI've been wanting to try this place for awhile and was disappointed. Went in around 630 and the place was dead. They had 3 teenage kids working, a girl at the register and 2 boys doing the cooking. The girl at the counter wasn't very friendly at all and showed no emotion although the boys were pretty friendly. Our food took about 20 min as we ordered it to go. The pizza was ok, tasted like a microwaveable pizza and the wings we ordered were very small and looked like the frozen wings you buy at the store. Had the barbecue sauce and mild sauce and both were ok( hard to mess up barbecue sauce) and the ranch sauce the have gave us had no taste and very very watery. I must say the price we paid for was fairly good but not enough to go back. Tailgaters or Barros is way better!!!Food is terrible . It's like going to a high school back yard kegger party. I will leave this place for the younger can't hold there liquor crowd..Bought two $16 slushie drinks, no alcohol in them
Go to Fat Tuesday's insteadSometimes I take a risk and try out coffee shops that I've never heard of just to satisfy my curiosity. Let me say, there is a reason I've never heard of this place.

This is a coffee shop that seems to exist because someone thought it would be an easy way to start a business, not because someone was actually interested in serving good quality coffee.

I will keep it short and devote my post to giving you my main qualms about Dolce.

1. The coffee was badly roasted and bitter. I don't know where they get their beans (maybe I don't want to know), but the coffee was of lowest quality and showed a lack of regard for the industry. If you're a coffee shop your main purpose is to have good coffee.

2. My iced latte was littered with coffee grounds. There should NEVER be bits of coffee in your coffee drink. At my first sip, the latte was so horribly bitter and burnt tasting I wondered why it tasted like smoke... it was the coffee grounds being sucked up through my straw and onto my palate. Even when I isolated the problem, pulled up the straw and tried my latte without shards of coffee... it wasn't good (hence point #1).

3. The ambiance is that of a nightclub trying to be a coffee shop. There is a time and place to watch Lil' Wayne music videos... and that time is not when I want to try to enjoy my horribly bitter latte. The couches were old and ripped and looked like rejects from someone's old bachelor pad.I'm not really sure what happened to this place. There's been a LOT of drama between the new owners and the staff lately, and all the good staff members who have busted their ass for a long time are being fired, and the ones who remain are also on their way out the door, or at least terrified that they too, will lose their job in the next week.

Sad. It was a good place, too. A new paint job inside won't change the fact that the owners are shitty to their staff, and in turn the restaurant suffers.Wow. And this is not a good wow at all.

Did NOT expect such bad food here. My fellow diners said they had better steaks from Outback, possibly Sizzler and Cocos.

The waiters seem programmed to try to upsell everything. The only "amazing" food on the menu from the kitchen are the highest priced items. 

Considering how much amazing food is available in Vegas, Beso sucks some major donkey balls. The various managers are completely useless.  The manager we got to "work" with Chad Jahn is beyond useless. The consensus is that he's an ex-bouncer and doesn't even know how to manage to make a drink much less manage a high-profile restaurant.

There seems to be too many staff running around pretending to be busy than actually working.  I saw no less than 3 managers pretty much walking the floor doing nothing.  None of them went up to any tables to inquire about the food, the service or anything that would normally be relevant to their jobs. There were too many hostesses worried about their outfits and make-up and being seen. 

Now, onto the food. Again, WOW. It was beyond awful--once it actually came out.  Apparently our ticket got dropped TWICE by the kitchen. And, did any manager come out to apologize and try to make nice? Uh, that'd be a no.

That's where the wonderful and awfully helpful /insert sarcasm here Chad came over. And he only came over because we actually asked the waiter where the manager was and why he wasn't the one trying to sooth things over with us.  Instead, we told him what we expected from our service. Comped food, a steep discount and free dessert/coffee/tea. At least he had the competency to do that, so I guess there is some hope. BUT, the best part is--he wasn't the one telling us. Our poor waiter was the one breaking the news. Isn't that a manager's job?

The waiter and his trainee were so sweet and trying to help out, but honestly, what else can they do? I think they pretty much gave up when they knew how much of the dinner was going to be cut, therefore reflecting their tip. We made sure they were compensated for their work. As for the main tab? Aw hale naw.  Took whatever discount they gave us. Normally our group would order 1-2 desserts to share. Yeah, call us greedy and bitter, but we each ordered one.  The sad thing is? Even the dessert took 15 minutes to come out AND it wasn't good.

The one star was because our waiter actually tried so hard.

Final report: More style than substance.I went with a group on saturday night, and most of us had a travelzoo voucher.  Our server was friendly, and service was quick and attentive.  We shared three appetizers - the meat and cheese plate, salmon carpaccio, and guacamole and chips.  They were nice for starters and not too large.

We each got a salad, mine was average - butter lettuce with a viniagrette, good but not great.  

For dinner I had the salmon, most people got steaks - all were tasty.  The meats were cooked to a good temp, the salmon was moist.  

One unfortunate person in our party got the chicken and shrimp.  He wasn't unfortunate in that it tasted bad, I think it was good.  He was unfortunate in that he got a bad case of food poisoning - vomiting and bloody stools.  And that's the reason I had to give the place a 1 - I wouldn't go back or recommend it to anyone because of that.Very disappointed. Customer service was very poor, they did not communicate properly throughout this whole ordeal.   It took 3 months to have my Rolex cleaned, they had misled me in the price by saying they would take care of the chipped crystal, clean and repair if needed, as this was a special gift from my now deceased husband. They cleaned it for 500 dollars but the crystal was still chipped She said the jeweler said I did not ok the fix?? That was the reason I brought it in? They told me they would get the person that repaired it, and of course a young lady stepped in and really did not know anything about what was going on...So, I went through 3 different sales people and no one had a clue as to what was to be done. Oh, of course I paid in full and left confused!
 They had also repaired a necklace prior to the rolex and I thought they had done a nice job, only to have it break within a few months of repair. When I brought it in to show her the necklace she came back with a very unprofessional, we will only honor this once and you can't have another warranty??? Um, never asked for a warranty just wanted it fixed! She asked me how old the necklace was and if I wore it a lot? Its a necklace of course I wear it. I am very careful with what I have a it is not "dimestore" quality.. 
Certainly, still upset and can't figure out what just happened....feel ripped off!!I went to the Apple Store on 3/24/12 the redeem a gift card. I decided to upgrade my 3gs to a 4s, simple enough. I walked in and made an appointment, waited 15 minutes and then a woman came over to wait on me. This is when it all started to go down hill. She was the most unhelpful and rude person I ever gave money to. When the transaction was done, she turned and walked away. I didn't even know we were done. No bag for my purchase, no thank you, nothing. I asked my wife if I did or say anything wrong and she said no, the girl was just rude.
Oh, my phone was defective and I had to go back on 3/27/12. I got a new phone after seeing a "genius". Apples words not mine, and really an oxymoron. My second phone was also defective. I really wanted a new iphone but after my experience with Apple customer service, I will be getting a Samsung phone instead. Apple has great products, usually, but awful customer service. After hours on the phone with an Apple IT person, I have had enough. Just because your product is popular, doesn't mean you can be rude.waited an hour for baked chicken and lasagna dinners. Chicken was RAW, service was atrocious. Bartender served shots to two very drunken patrons that were next to us. Won't be going back here anytime soon, if ever!This is the closest doughnuts place to my house - and almost every time I go there, there's always a long line, so by the time you get to order, you feel like you need to be in rush otherwise the person behind the counter gets frustrated. There are no smiling ppl working here. They always look grumpy and want you to order as quickly as possible. Not kid friendly as they don't care about your kids. I will drive further to get my coffee and doughnuts so that i can start my day nice and happy. Why should I go to a place that acts like they are doing me a favor when I am the customer.READ THIS IF YOU ARE A COLLEGE STUDENT - AVOID AT ALL COSTS
I am a college student. I was moving in to my new apartment and a man nonchalantly offered me water and promised more free if I signed up for sparkletts. Being a college student I was suckered in at the promise of free stuff and someone being nice, not knowing the pain and countless hours on the phone with the "people" in the customer service department. This place can't do one thing right - they could fu** up a cup of coffee -  from delivering too many water juggs, charging fees for ENERGY( I already pay a power bill, why do I have to pay sparkletts????!!!!!!!) but foolishly I kept the service, having hope in the human race. Unfortunately my hope has been destroyed, and my wallet has suffered, due to the incompetence of this company and its services. Every day I get water out of this stupid cooler, I kick myself for not buying a Britta. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!We have been 'Regulars' at this place for over 2+ years, after our favorite sushi joint-Brian's Beach closed. We use to come about once a week or so, until all our waitresses were replaced with some new ones. Our once a week trips became more like once a month. Don't get me wrong,but if you're going to name your restaurant 808-please have some sense to have people with some aloha or people that can pronounce the Hawaiian terms that's on the menu. 
Nevertheless, we walk in tonight, excited to use our gift certificate that we got for Christmas, bring in some out of town family, and have the worst experience ever! What a shame 808 Sushi!!! Too our surprise, after a horrible customer service experience-waiting to get our orders about 3 times, hot tea not hot, and not even warm, waitresses clearing plates while we're in the process of eating off of them, water not refilled timely, reminding waitresses what we ordered, and then the most unbelievable experience ever.... Now we're ready to pay with our $200 gift certificate . Quickly, the waitress says, we can't do cash value and that the $200 will be forfeited. I'm appalled and state, "We don't want cash back, we just want the remainder of our balance perhaps in another gift certificate?!" She rushes to her manager on duty who took about 30 minutes to call the general manager 'Agnes' to tell us the same thing. Now, you have not only lost loyal customers, but this loyal customer has no problem sharing the stupidity of this restaurant. 
Why sell someone a $200 gift certificate when you have to use it all at once or loose it?!!!! No one has time for that $h*+!!! It's $26.95 per person  for AYCE. I don't have a family of 8 to use it all at once, or specify somewhere on that big card all the rules you just made up. This isn't a group on special, my Mother-in-law paid you $200 so we can enjoy this restaurant a few times!!! FYI, sell smaller increments, or warn the buyer of this rule-(waitress heard of 2 days ago), unless your intention was to rip someone off! Who does that???!!! Or do people a favor don't sell them at all, so no one else gets ripped off. Never stepping foot in this place again and in all honesty, I would rather drive the 30 minutes to Island Sushi where they have the EXACT menu with competent people that have 'ALOHA!'Awful. Went in and told the lady my bra size and she told me I was completely wrong and didn't know what I was talking about. After a few minutes of telling me I didn't know what I was talking about, she then measured me and was quite surprised that I was right about my size. Then she told me that they couldn't help me because I was too big in cup and too small in the waist.  It was an embarrassing and horrible experience.Proof that you can market and sell anything with a catchy name. Lame happy hour, flavorless food, inattentive staff that's trying to look like an American apparel add. If this wasn't a Fox concept in the heart of Old Town it would of closed its doors 6 months ago.DO NOT GO!

Food.  Boring.  Drinks. Average.  Bartenders, chime in when when drunk patrons are making things uncomfortable.  Wish this place was worth while, but the food has no creativity and the bartenders make a stale maragarita at best.  Maybe this place is better for lunch, but after dinner, they may have sleeping bags for nap time.I contracted Energy 1st Exteriors to replace the windows and screens in my house in 2011.  They were very quick to get the work started, but one of the windows arrived cracked and some of the screens were damaged.  It took weeks and weeks for them to come back and replace the cracked window and screens, which frustrated me greatly.

Here it is spring of 2014 and every single one of the plastic tabs on the screens have broken off and crumbled to pieces when I tried to remove them to clean the glass.  

I called and contacted Energy 1st at least FIVE distinct and separate times and they continually ignore me or give me the run around.  Now they're claiming that the company which manufactured the windows is out of business, and my warranty is entirely void.

Do.  Not.  Trust.  These.  People.So I have ordered from this place twice now. Each time they have not sent what was in the description. Each time have not answered the phone when I called  to complain. I ordered the cheese and olives platter. They don't send olives they send me cucumber??? Come on? Some dishes I have had are good but most just come up lacking. Bland flavor. Lacking in spices. This place is a pass. I wish someone had told me that when you order from then don't expect to get what it says in the description. Maybe dine in is better but delivery is horrible.Drive Thru is a NIGHTMARE.  Food is cold more often than not and the orders are CONSISTENTLY WRONG.I hate giving bad reviews, but I've gotta be honest. The sandwich was over cooked and dry, and there was so much grease in the fries that it leaked thru the bag... 

At least the soda was good, I guess...My wife and I were looking for a particular type of rose for our garden. We called this location and asked if they had it in stock and what the price was. They said they did and quoted us a price of $24.99 for a gallon sized plant. Good to go. We drive there and find the rose bush but it is listed as $44.99. So we go to the front and say that  we had called and driven 30 minutes to get this rose and we were told "Oops...sometimes the  prices on my list up front right". No sh!t Sherlock. So...will you honor the price quoted? NO. 

So we drove down the street to A And P Nursery on Baseline west of Lindsay and got the same size plant that they were selling for $44.99 for $16.99. 

Don't waste your time with these rip-off artists.Went there for the 1st time, today.  I had a money mailer coupon for a full service wash.  I told my service adviser, Jason I wanted the full service wash on the coupon.  He asked if I wanted to upgrade for a couple dollars more.  I said no.  He said I didn't have to be rude about it.  My car a RAV 4 went off for the wash and I went in to pay.  I noticed a $1 charge on my bill for an over-sized vehicle.  I asked the cashier what their definition of an over-sized vehicle was.  She asked what type of vehicle I had.  I told her a Toyota RAV4.  She checked and said a Toyota RAV4 is NOT an over-sized vehicle.  I then asked her to remove the $1 charge Jason had added to my bill.   Makes me wonder how many other customers' bills have this added $1 and people just accept it.  Was this pay back from Jason because I said no to an upgrade?  Or is this a sneaky practice Super Star Car Wash uses to pad a customer's bill?  My car was cleaned but I'm on the fence about using this car wash again.I always had my car serviced at Rob's Quality Automotive, but Shadow MA Service was a newer business in the neighborhood, very close to our house, so i decided to give them a try. Dropped my car in the shop, got back home. A little later receive a call from the rep, saying that the axle on my car is in a condition, that if I drove another 50-100 miles, it would unravel and fall out , which could lead to a very serious accident. I was mortified when I heard it, because i had no indication of anything THAT serious. The problem was ABS BRAKES light was coming on and staying lit up for the duration of the drive. So, they give me an estimate-  $550.00. I called Rob's to ask how much they would charge me if they have to replace the axle and the bearing. Rob said: if it is the axle only-$240.00, if bearing only-$280.00, if both- then the sum of those two amounts. I thought  that for the differnce of $20-$30 it was not worth it for me to go pick up the car, drive it to Rob: so I authorised Shadow MAS to proceed with the work. An 1,5 later i got a call that the car was ready. I stop by, they give me the bill for $550.00 and offered to show me the part they replaced. They show me HUB BEARING and explain that the problem with the axle was that the tightening nut on it  was very loose, could have come undone, so they tightened it. I was then very unhappy about the cost of the job, but paid it. Couple days later we took my husbands' car for service, so I showed Rob my receipt from SMAS and ask him what he would have charged based on the description of the part, which was on the receipt. He called NAPA , asked about that part and printed for me an estimate showing that same part and labor costing $315. Right away i saw why my bill was so high- SMA charged me $ 390.00 for rhe part, while the Rob would charge only $146.90 and still make his markup on it. I went back to Kurt, owner of SMAS and confronted him about the bill. He acted like there was nothing wrong with the bill and that the " charge for the part was so close to HIS cost" This was an outright lie, because I had a quote from NAPA what the cost of the part was and told him. His response? " I am making money- I mark up price for EVERY part I install". So, it is not enough that he makes money for the labor,and would make , say, $15-20 marking up parts. NO, he had to gouge me additional $240 on top of the price of the part. Who does he think he is? He did not manufacture the part, store it or transport it. He had it delivered, installed right away, but used it to make additional $240.00. Shadow Mountain Auto Service is a RIPOFF! NEVER AGAIN!!!A few weeks ago this location was having a special on first time hair cuts. I needed one so I went for it. I received one of the worst cuts of my life. When I pointed out issues the girl just kept making it worse. I complained to the salon manager who then did as much repair as possible and told me to give it a few weeks to grow and the next cut would be free. I just got off the phone with this location. the manager is no longer with them and there is no record of my visits. This is crappy customer service. to top it off the original hair butcher sent me a "come back and see us" card stuffed with coupons. Great! except the coupons had expired. Really?
My advise, Stay away!Service is terrible in the mornings. I even contacted the manager to tell them so about 7 months ago. I haven't seen any improvement. Bagels and coffee are fine, but don't order specialty drinks because they taste awful. Just go to Starbucks, it'll be cheaper and taste better.Grease, grease, and more grease. Everything is covered in gravy. The spam and eggs made me sick. Just gross.Stayed there 8/20/11 with  2 friends. Check in took 30 minutes, reception very pleasant & upon learning we were locals gave us a great view from the 45 th floor. Elevators open and upon walking down the hallway, it smelled of vomit. Okay, maybe just happened. Smell never went away. Room gorgeous view of Bellagio fountains. Everything controlled by TV, very high tech, except when both remotes need batteries. Shouldn't that be part of the daily check list? Just sayin. Okay, to find a bamboo, pool very crowded, so we head for the pool on the 17 th floor, before we get there run into a young couple who says that's more crowded and the music is so loud it's unbearable.This from a couple in their 20's. So, we head for the Boulevard Pool, long walk through the conference room area, strange. A nice emloyee tells us a short cut, we get close and are told it's closed to prepare for a concert. Okay, we talk to some folks who say the Bamboo pool is emptying so we decide to go there. We find two lounges for the 3 of us and 2 of us head for the pool. To say it was filthy was an understatement. We could see the bottom of the pool at the Bellagio from the 45 th floor but could not see our feet in this pool! When did it become OK to smoke in a pool and flick your ashes in it? Exit stage left and to take a shower. Gross does not cover it. We went to Mandalay Bay for a show and luckily took a cab. Both cab drivers said getting in & out of this property is a nightmare, in fact on the way back, he let us out a block away or it would have taken 30 minutes just to turn in. Monday talked to a friend who went to the concert and took him 2 hours to exit the parking garage. Positive side STK restaurant was great even though they took away my drink before I was finished. Front desk rude the next morning when we asked for a 30 minute late check out. Do yourself a favor stay at  the tried and true, Bellagio, Venetian, The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. This one may need a few more years to get it right, for the price---------so not worth it.Stayed at the Cosmo this past weekend.  This was my second time staying at this hotel.  The only complaint I have is the hotel manager needs to know how to treat hotel guests properly.  Upon check I had my friend stay with my luggage.  When I got my room key I was notified by my friend that the hotel manager took one of our cases of beer and our $200 bottle of liquor that we were going to bring to our suite we just booked for the weekend.  When I spoke to the hotel manager he said hard liquor/beer is not allowed to be in the hotel room.  Are you kidding me.  You pay 900 dollars a night at this hotel and you can't bring liquor or beer to the room.  What a joke.  His response was "ill do you a favor and let you have 1 case of beer because what can you do with a 12 pack of beer"and laughed. Then he made us check it in at the front desk and we couldn't get it till we checked out.  I used to love this hotel but until the hotel manager knows how to treat hotel guest/military veterans who just came back from a year deployment and can't drink at this hotel in Vegas I'm never going to come back...Car was dirty, desk person told me I was not a U.S. Citizen and therefore could not rent a car, regardless of the fact that I had not only rented from them a year ago and the fact that I had my DL out in front of him.  Took 15 minutes of arguing with this idiot before a co-worker (whom had been listening and not busy, but obviously ignoring the situation) came over and showed this guy how to work his mouse!  Literally the guy could not use the computer.  Then when I tried to return the car the people who worked the washers could not tell me where the booth person was...even though I had been waiting for 30 minutes.  They just kept telling me to wait "over there" and they all pointed in different directions.  I finally had to go inside and get assistance.  The same computer savvy guy was there and told me he could not help me (what a surprise), and to go wait outside again.  I told him I wanted to see a manager immediately and (what a surprise) he came outside all the while acting put-out that he had to leave the job he knows so well.  NEVER AGAIN!

P.S. they will charge unsuspecting renters an airport fee.  THEY ARE NO WHERE NEAR THE AIRPORT and I am a local.  And a shuttle fee as well, even if you did not take the shuttle.Unbelievably bad customer service along with haughty snobbery. I will never recommend this chain or shop here again.

A dear friend of mine is getting married in Las Vegas and she found bridesmaid dresses online through their website. The bridesmaids are located in three different states. I took a trip to Las Vegas to try the dress on and place my order.

My first experience was the snotty clerk that looked me up and down and pulled a size 10 off the rack for me to try on. I am a standard size 8, sometimes a 6 and was a bit offended that she didn't ask me my size but handed me a size 10. I walked into the dressing room and slipped on the dress. When I came out of the dressing room the clerk was no where to be found. My friend and I discussed the dress, color and fit and how it would look on the other bridesmaids - still no clerk to be found. I went back into the dressing room to change back into my street clothes... still no clerk.

What I realized later is that Alfred Angelo must size their dresses such that the purchaser has to buy a larger size therefore resulting in plus size up-charges for those ladies who are slightly larger than I. So, once you reach a size 10 in "real" sizing, it's an Alfred Angelo size 12 and there is an additional fee tacked on; reverse vanity sizing.

But, back to my story...It took over an hour to make the purchase. The computer system didn't work properly. I had to sign a contract that was several pages long and when I decided to actually read the contract and ask questions about things like the additional rush fee and the shipping charge to have it sent to my home in Utah the clerk couldn't answer my questions and kept having to bring over the manager.

This was January, the wedding is in May, and I was charged a rush fee. Unbelievable. 

So now it's April and a clerk left me a message to inform me that my dress had arrived at the store in Las Vegas. It took me three phone calls to reach someone and to get a call back to tell them that I had written on my contract the address in which they had agreed to ship the dress to me in Salt Lake City at no additional charge. The clerk argued with me that their policy is $20 shipping. I asked her to pull up my contract, it was hand written on the bottom and signed by me and the store manager. She couldn't manage to do that and had to call me back.

Honestly, I don't understand how a store/chain like this stays in business.Not so hot.   Confusing as to park when you arrive, only 2 bellman and on arrival we did not see any, so we just kind of had to wait in the car.  Finally one arrived, flagged us where to park the car and said luggage had to be checked in there as a room would not be ready.  In all this confusion, who was in the car, who was already out, we forgot the tip.  But our bellman did not as he announced loudly, " Guess I work for free today"  The last one in our party ran back and tipped right away.  We stood in for ONE hour to check in.  They charged additional $50 to our credit cards for incidentals we "might" have.  It was taken away about 5 days later.   Once in our room we immediately called for luggage as we had dinner and a show scheduled.  After a half hour, we called again to check and the girl told " we are busy and your luggage will arrive when it arrives.  I don't have to say anymore.   We will never stay here again, really poor service and a horrible attitude.  They do not care about guests or repeat visits.   Go someplace else.Beware of this company taking you on an unwanted scenic route.

On 6/4/10, I ended up in a Nellis Cab from Mandalay Bay to the Airport.  As soon as I got in the cab, the driver (who had a Filipino accent) asked me if I was Filipino.  I said no and then he asked me what I was (very rude).  He then proceeded to drive through the back service lots of Mandalay, which seemed odd to me at first, but I thought he might be taking a shortcut.  Then we started driving towards the freeway, away from the airport.  I asked the driver, "hey, the airport is back there" as I pointed behind me.  He said, this is the way and got on the freeway.  When we finally got to the airport, I waited for him to get our bags out.  The meter read $20.83.  I said to him, "Is this your first time here??".  He looked at me like was cold busted and said, "what".  I told him that I know he tried to rip me off.  He told me to just pay him whatever I wanted.  I didn't have time mess around so I gave him $10 and told him he's an ass****.  He clearly would not have told me to pay whatever if it was an honest drive.  The cab number was #751.

I will never get in a Nellis cab again.Went in on Black Friday around 9:00am, they we're very busy.  Had every intention of buying a Bosch dishwasher; but after standing in front of the appliance for 10 minutes and watching an employee walk buy and not ask to help me out, we left.This is my last visit here. Careless sloppy work and like others said they up charge for callous remover! The man who just did my pedicure didn't even dry my legs before applying moisturizer so basically had a crappy massage and no moisturizer. He was in a hurry to get out the door. he was miserable with no personality at all. Seriously worst pedicure in years! There are a million other places to go so do that!Had to wait a little while, but no big deal. Did not get greeted by anyone in the salon!!! Not even the lady that did my pedicure! The actual service was ok, but the woman that did my pedicure was pretty rough! And she did not shape my toenails very well. Salon also did not have a good selection of nail polishes! Overall, disappointed. : /I've been going to this nail salon religiously for three years... their service used to be AMAZING, and that is what has kept me going back.  Unfortunately, they have a completely new staff... and they are awful.  Last week i sat there for 25 minutes without them even acknowledging me, and there wasnt a single person in the salon, so I walked out.  Today when I went, my nail technician decided to be on her cell phone the ENTIRE time, and cut me more than once... she didnt even say sorry!  While the other girls were lounging around with their shoes off and their feet propped up on the nail desks... absolutely unprofessional and distgusting!  As a business owner myself, this service was at best awful.... I'm so sad Theresa and the rest of the old crew are gone... looks like I have to find a new nail salon :(Decided to stop in and have lunch at this dive bar.  I am a local and I don't have a problem with bar food or the bar atmosphere, but I wasn't impressed with the service here.  I did get my lunch quickly, but the bartender was not very attentive and there were few people in the bar (maybe 6).  I gambled $40.00 and got charged for my ice tea.  It took her forever to get me my check & I had to get back to work.  My biggest issue is that she dropped the "F" bomb several times.  I get that it is a bar but you should be more aware of your customers.The inside of my car wasnt vacuumed the way it should be, my boyfriend had to ask for a towel so he can wipe down finger prints on the front of my car and on the windows as well, black stains on the inside werent wiped down, although it was only $18.99 its not worth to spend your money on something you can do yourself for free. It could be that is all young kids working including girls, everyone seems tired and without a drop of energy, definitely need to get a better staff thats full of energy and could clean cars the correct way. All in all i will never come back to this car wash if it means im only throwing my money in the trash.


Also the african american woman that was the register was extremely rude. Yelling saying " I SAID HELLO" After i had smiled at her, right after i told her " i smiled at you" she put her hands up and said " OHHHH BIG DEALLLL" not sure what that was about i laughed at the confusionI received a menu in my door today (in a non soliciting neighborhood) and decided to place a delivery order today. I put my order in and was given an outrageous total price. I asked why it was so expensive and she said its because I'm so far away so they charge a $5 delivery fee. I immediately cancelled my order lol. I don't understand there solicitation strategy. FYI I live in Ventana Canyon apartments.Why no one has reported this business to the health department is beyond me. The place smells really bad. The floors are soaked with sweat accumulated through the many, many, many overcrowded classes they have held there over time.
The teachers are a narcissistic and self involved. They dont much help anybody with the movements and go about conducting the class, going through the different poses as if they were the only ones in the room!I stopped by this McDonalds yesterday to pick up breakfast for my wife and son. To find when I get home that they had not given me half my order. Being in a time crunch I decided to call, The manager acknowledge that they knew they had left things out on accident and so i tried to tell them to refund my card but I was told they could not do that and that if I wanted to I could come in the next morning and they would give me what they had forgot to give me. I was not happy about having to go back but I did. Now I'm even more unhappy after going there this morning and trying to get what they forgot to give me. The manager was rude and acted like I was wasting her time to get my food that they had forgot to give me. So after giving me some cold mcmuffins, no apology  and could not even offer me a free cup of coffee for my major inconvenience. I left and will never go back to this McDonald's. I know people make mistakes but it's how you correct those mistakes and the customer service you give when you make a mistake that matters. Corporate needs to help this McDonald's get it together!Really really bad service! Girls are snobby & they get super defensive when I start asking about promos.  
Its unfortunate cause their prices are really good. But I would rather drive all the way to the other one than come here (5mins away) cause I love shopping & it definitely doesnt feel comfortable shopping here.Company used some 3rd party advertising arm to get my service (Clear Link), this company never mentioned a $200 cancellation fee in the 30 minutes they were selling the service and saying I could terminate at any time yada yada.
Then when i need to cancel after 9 months Century Link informs me of this (saying they sent an email after service started with this information.. which certainly could be true i never saw it but that sounds like stuff they happily had go to a spam filter)

THe funniest part is the remaining service on this contract I never agreed to was under $100 and they were insisting on a $190 fee

And when pointed out the people getting service on their behalf lied they didn't care.. insisting it was my fault

To be fair CS in ever telecommunications company is horrid and based on deception. Gee wonder why we have no loyalty to any of themTerrible! Do not take your vehicle here!
They will take your money but not fix the problem. I'm fairly certain they actually created more problems intentionally on my vehicle. I saw the business was being investigated for exactly the same thing. I had them fix my radiator hose once and they put the wrong hose on which kinked because it didn't fit correctly. I got about two miles down the road before the pressure built up enough to blow the hose out and my radiator was bone try. My ASE certified mechanic friend took one look at it and said whoever put the hose on my truck shouldn't be turning a wrench on lawn mowers let alone people's vehicles. This place is absolute garbage and I can't believe they are still in business. I wish I could give them zero stars.I've been to a few tanning salons in town, and while they are all pricey, Body Heat's contract cancellation fee is absolutely ridiculous. A contract is good for 10 months where you're paying 60 a month, and to cancel, its a whopping $200! Really?! As if it's an important association. It's a TANNING salon! Aside from that, its limited to Nevada so its practically impossible to move without practically selling them your lung. In addition, they don't offer other benefits within their contract. I visited another tanning salon where my friend is a member, and to avoid possible thoughts that I'm an employee there, I'm going to keep the name anonymous. Anyway, it's the same price and they treat their "VIP" members with monthly facial red light treatments, hydration stations and water massage beds. To sum my frustration up, as part of the customer service industry, I'm well aware that exemplary customer service is what brings people back to businesses. That being said, being excessively ripped off by Body Heat tanning is enough cause to avoid this place at all costs in the future. Based on previous comments, my disappointment appears to be a shared feeling amongst others.Stay away from this store. The manager is rude, a fraud, and arrogant!!!  They talked us into a plan that costs me $600 for a cell phone. I had no idea that I was paying that, the 'installments" were supposed to be at the discounted price ($199). We went to Corporate who agreed with me and logged a complaint against the store. The manager had the ability to right the wrong but refused! Unless you just are paying for something off the shelf and you know the price stay away from contracts. The manager wanted us to sit down with the sales person and discuss because it was not his problem. Bad Bad bad.......
Thankfully Corporate helped us to defer costsCUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS!!! I was extremely disappointed and shocked yesterday by the owner's unprofessionalism! I have been a loyal customer for 3 years (I went weekly). I walked in yesterday and was yelled at by her that I didn't show up for my appointment last week! I never made an appointment for last week because I was on vacation. That was her mistake! She had the nerve to yell at me in front of all of the customers that were there! How embarrassing! When I got back from vacation, I called and spoke to one of her employees to set up an appointment. After she yelled at me for not showing up last week, she then told me that I didn't have an appointment and asked if I could come back. Her employee even told her that I called to make an appointment. Miraculously, it disappeared! After being loyal for so many years, I DO NOT deserve to be treated this way! There are so many nail shops in town and any one of them will be happy to have my business! 
TAO, tip for the future - DON'T embarrass a customer in front of another customer! Not good business!!! (Especially coming from someone who is in the customer service industry)Terrible! Worst foot massage ever n I've been to many. Total lack of effort. I almost  wanted to quit halfway through. DO NOT WASTE Your time n money here!!!We went here because I bought the $10 for $20 worth of food / drinks Groupon thing.

The food was pretty decent. The cottage cheese dip stuff sounded interesting so we got it and it was very good. My girlfriend got the shrimp tacos and she liked them. I did the buffalo chicken salad. It was good too.

So why am I only giving it 1 star? Because they only honored $10 of the $20 Groupon. So basically I paid $10 to get $10 off of my bill.Not Good! Scottsdale location last week with 2 friends. Ordered 3 burger med-rare, all came out overcooked well done. Sent back and the recook was also well done, not med rare as ordered. If restaurant cannot cook a hamburger correctly there is a problem. Dry, tasteless meat. Taste like frozen meat, and pre-cooked hamburgers to speed up orders. Bad process and terrible product. I was embarrassed that I brought friends there. Never again, if you want a really great hamburger don't go here..I was excited to come back to RnR since I haven't been in a few months. I was very disappointed by the food, the service seemed meh, and the DJ's music selection was all over the place (could be a good thing) but he chose all of the bad songs from their respective genre. I had the vanilla bean pancakes and they were dry and tasted a little like the bread you get at church. My friends had the green chili pulled pork tacos and pulled pork platter which they found to be very bland. 

There are many places you can go for brunch, this has sadly fallen to the bottom of my list.I'm cleaning up my draft reviews and was here 2/17/12 so this bad review is long overdue. I'm no decorator but the black and yellow outside colors make you think you're in a Western Union or some check cashing place...which would probably make better bagels and whitefish salad anyway!  Round bread with a hole in the center does not mean it's a bagel! Tasted more like pretzel dough but more bland. They sell Dr. Browns in bottles which is always good but no Celrey soda ??? I don't know about the deli meat because i was going just for breakfast bagel/fish but as far as bagels are concerned I guess it's better than Lender's bagels or a Fast food chain. The whitefish salad was too loose and with no discernible whitefish flavor. Ain't nuttin New Yawk about this place food wise.The fields are ok. This is more of a place for first timers.Not a place for individuals that are very into the sport and take the challenge of the sport seriously. If speed ball is your game this is not for you  there one speed ball field that was just about completely deflated and sitting on rocks. The staff is friendly but they do a poor job at managing the games .   it's hard to think too positive with the way they leave the conditions of the fields and I would categorize it over priced based on that and lack of staff involvement.   Im end -good for first timers or beginning players that like woods ball. But experienced players you might not enjoy it at all
