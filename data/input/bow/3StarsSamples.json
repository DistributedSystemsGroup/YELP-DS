For Wisconsin, this is about the best you are going to get for Chinese Food.

Sorry, you live in Wisconsin.

But the food is very good.  Huge servings, enormous shrimps, chicken that is tender, fresh rice.

Don't complain Cheeseheads, this is good as it gets for Chinese in Wisconsin.Well, it's a Michaels. Nothing particularly special there. Normally, I'd give most Michaels stores 4stars, but this one tends to be a bit messy and has the wonkiest layout of any craft store. Also, if you pop in and don't find what you're looking for, you have to loop through ALL the checkouts to exit (not just pass by one like at most similar stores). This makes me feel a bit uncomfortable if they happen to not have what I'm looking for or if I just stop in to price something, etc. 

Overall, a decent place. Greenway Station on the whole is a bit of a weird shopping center, but I do love that a craft store is in the mix.I've been to this place a few times, most recently at a dinner at the beginning of a bachelorette party. I think this is a very decent option for someplace on the north east side. 

For the party, they were very accommodating for a larger group and us adding our own decorations to the tables. The gals hosting the party had planned it with the restaurant and had a fixed menu with three options available for everyone. It worked out really nicely for our party and the food was pretty tasty. I don't remember exactly what I got but I do remember enjoying the boxed up leftovers when I was hungover the next morning. 

The service was very good considering we were a boisterous group of about 20 ladies. I was having an ice tea craving that day and think I went through about 8 glasses of the stuff while we were there. The two waitresses helping our table we spot on. They even allowed us to bring in our own cake and provided plates for serving it. 

Overall, I think it's decent basic Italian food, but really good at handling larger parties if you call ahead.$11 for dinner. Cheap typical american buffet fare. Not much more to say.

Highs:
+ Fried chicken
+ Mac & Cheese
+ Biscuits and gravy
+ Fudge cake!

Lows:
- Gross popcorn shrimp
- Dry pot roast
- Sad selection of fruit (just cantaloupe and canned peaches/oranges)We went here for breakfast on a Sunday. It was very crowded, but we only had to wait 20-30 minutes. I'm not gonna lie, some of the staff seem incompetent, but they are nice in general. I am giving it 3 because:

-Cool, old style, but generic diner interior
-Reasonable prices
-Food was decent
-Crowd was good, chill
-there were a good number of veg options, but not too many for us meat eaters (yum)We stop here regularly and are generally pleased with the food.  Huge servings generally mean a two for one deal -- you get dinner and lunch the next day.  Vegetarian/vegan options as well as old fashioned meat choices like fried chicken and meatloaf.  All are quite tasty.  

The only real disappointment is the desserts.  They LOOK great in the prominent display case, but they just don't have much going for them except fat and sugar.  It would be good for the fruit pies to taste a little like fruit and the chocolate desserts to have the richness and depth of chocolate.  Just lots of fat and sugar so that generally, all the desserts taste about the same.  The crumble-top pies are problematic both in terms of flavor and texture (and the fat/sugar problem).  That explains my 3-star review. 

 Long story short, come for dinner and stop for frozen custard on the way home.This place is really hit or miss for me. I really want to like them, as there aren't a lot of cigar bar options in the Madison area, but they've got issues.

They have a *huge* selection of cigars in their well-stocked, well-maintained humidor, which is fantastic (as well as recommendations, if you're not sure what you're in the mood for.) 

There's also comfortable seating in addition to the bar if you'd like to hang out and enjoy your cigar and a drink. In addition, they also host wine, cigar, and other tasting events that are well-attended.

The only thing I can't get over are the bizarre hours. They're open until 7pm Tuesday-Friday, 5pm on Saturdays, and closed Sundays and Mondays.

For me (and a huge number of my social circle,) cigars are a relaxing, social experience, not a rushed errand, like I'm picking up milk and eggs at the grocery. 

As a small business owner myself, I respect another's need to set their hours as they see fit, but with the Tasting Room's business hours as they are, I'm rarely able to make it over there on weekdays, and lack of weekend evening hours nix that possibility as well.

I'd like to give them at least four stars, but it doesn't matter if you have the best-stocked humidor in the Midwest if it's difficult to access it.This place gets packed for lunch! The menu is extensive and moderately priced. My friend and I both had turkey burgers and both of us were really pleased! I recommend the green chile burger :-). Delish. The fries were great- skinny, shoestring fries. 

I only gave this 3 stars because it is your typical sports bar- lots of TVs, nothing special. But the food is great. I would be a repeat customer of I lived in Phoenix!The Brioche french toast they're advertising now is amazing!

Service was quite good; I've been here before and it isn't always good.

Clean enough.  Decent prices.I don't know why I like this place!  The food is average- not craveable. The service is consistently bad. I'm sorry, but I have encountered so many clueless employees at this place that are too pathetic to even complain about. 

That aside, I like the way this place feels. It's fun to take my younger family members from out of town.  What kid wouldn't want to eat lunch in an old-time train car? Plus, ice cream is free with a dinner- can't beat that! Don't expect your waiter to be a wine expert- or even know what a mimosa is during Sunday brunch- but, it is a cute little place with lots of fun memorabilia.  Like I said, the food is not going to knock your socks off, but it's not that bad- just forgettable.  Stick to the basics that are hard to mess up, like lasagna, and enjoy that free ice cream (I suggest the spumoni).I went to Zoe's Kitchen today for lunch and ordered the Ham & Swiss grilled sandwich. My first experience with Zoe's was mediocre, but this time was much better. There was a lot on the menu to order, but I was in the mood for something with flavor but simple. It definitely hit the spot. I work downtown and it was quick, there was seating available, but a lot of people there, and parking was much better than Pei Wei (right across the street).Dropping some stars due to the Luminaria policy. Myself and four friends bought tickets to the luminarias a bit ago. It rained today, so the luminarias were canceled, which I understand. However, as the event is sold out every other night, we were told we could not get tickets for another night and could get a refund or donate our ticket money. I do appreciate the refund, and I know they cannot control the weather, but I do think it stinks that we will miss the luminarias through no fault of our own.This zoo is a pretty cool place to check out (just avoid the summer).  I wish more of it was indoors because it does get pretty toasty, but if you live in Phoenix you have to check it out.

The library does have free passes so grab one of those to keep your cost down.  Also if you can spare the extra cash please feed the sting rays!  That was pretty awesome :-)

Overall though, there are better zoos that are just a "daycation" away.  I recommend Bearizona and Wildlife World Zoo.The people who run this local store are rude.  They do not accept exchanges, even for defective products.  I purchased a guitar tuner to be used in my class, and specifically asked for one with no moving parts to be broken.  Within 2 weeks the tuner was not functioning.  I was told to bring the item back to "See what we can do", only to find out that they did not take back anything, regardless.  This could have been told to me on the phone, rather than wasting an hour of my time, and gas.  As a music educator, I am very distraught over the lack of professionalism, and cannot understand how a business like this would rather lose a customer who spends hundreds of dollars a year on music supplies for his class, over refusal to remedy a simple situation like this.


EDIT:
The people at Central Music have sent me a replacement tuner free of charge.  This replacement is very gracious, and shows that despite the initial resistance to accommodate a customer, they have followed through and made it right.  My students thank you, and I thank you.This is one of my favorite spots go dine after a loong wait of sitting around in the Indian Hospital's many waiting rooms. 

I've never been there during lunch hours, usually right before the evening rush and I've never experienced a long wait. I've noticed that it's pretty quiet, I'm usually sitting at the loudest table in the place! The service is decent. I've had better and I've also have had FAR worse! 

The food is good. Their combinations are GIANT! And so is their soda! They come in these HUGE cups, and it's hard for me to finish a second! lol, but someone at my table is always willing to help me! Their tortas are to DIE for!! I always order either the Al Pastor or Carne Asada Torta! Their salsa is very good but it can be a struggle to get the waitress to get a second bowl. 

The staff behind the counter always seems busy preparing food and getting to-go orders ready. It's sometimes cool to watch them go at it all warp speed! One thing about this place is that you have to go up to the counter to get your ticket when you're ready to pay instead of having the waitress bring you the check. This is a cultural thing, a lot of hardcore authentic mexican places are like this, so just go with it. 

Parking in their lot can be a lil tricky, I've hit a few cars trying to park my car here, but I think it's because I'm a bad driver. But still make sure your rear view and side view mirrors are facing the right direction! :P and expect a great meal with no frills or BS pretention, this is the real deal... sure, there's better places to get great Mexican food in the town, but after spending half a day to have an IHS dr. tell me that all I need is tylnol, all I want is a flippin' taco!Knocking a star off for you Rokerij. Believe me, this hurts me more than it hurts you. I visited last Sunday and our service was friendly, but it didn't make up for the poor delivery of food and the problem with solving issues that we had. I have only had the small plates from Rokerij. This trip I decided to try some of their "New Mexican" offerings.  My appetizer order, which was specifically stated to be an appetizer, not an entree came with my entree. Considering the appetizer did not even have to be cooked (steak tartare), that's unacceptable. When I commented on it I got a "Ugh, I know, right?" Um...really? My entree which was the Rokerij sampler was meh. The best part of the dish was the benedict. The enchiladas were bland and plain old mush.  I had dinner with my best friend Amber, and my good friend Ayesha. Ayesha had me sample her enchiladas as she has specifically asked that she not be served pork. I bit into a bite of pork enchilada off of Ayesha's plate. When the waiter was flagged down, he said "Hm, not sure what to do about this." Really?? Luckily, before I went off like a powder keg, he offered to remake them. He didn't comp anything for the obvious mistakes that were made. I hope he realized that there were some boo-boos made when he saw his tip was so small. I hope to give back the star I just took away, but they're going to have to wow me to do that. It's too bad that this trip was so disappointing.I decided to check this place out since it's by my work and cheap (5.99 w/drink).  As the other stated its a basic place.  There are only a few food options.  What they had was good but they are missing alot.  The lady was very nice and the food was pretty fresh.  Basically what I remember was there was Sweet and Sour chicken, Pork in some black bean sauce, another chicken in some sauce (kung pao maybe), breaded drumstick, rice, chow main, teriyaki chicken and egg flour soup.  I don't do seafood so there may have been something that I'm forgetting.  Anyways you'll have about 6 or 7 things to choose from and its all decent.  Mainly going 3 stars for a very limited selection.  If your into "hole in the wall" places check it out.  If your a fan of the bigger chinese buffets you won't be satisfied.Nice place for weekday Happy Hour.  Sizable patio and a solid selection of drinks. The wait staff is very polite and engaging.Hillstone is good... but it's not Houston's. I was devastated when i found out they are closing the Houston's in Scottsdale next year and heard that Hillstone is basically the same, (it replaced the Houston's in Phoenix). I work right across the street, so finally I figured I'd give it a shot.

The restaurant is beautiful, the staff is nice, but the Caesar salad (my favorite) was terrible compared to Houston's. There was corn in it, which I'm not totally understanding and some larger clumps of lettuce that made the salad uneven and harder to share. I'm afraid to try to the burger... but in fairness, the salmon appetizer was just as good.

CONCLUSION: Don't close Houston's. It's better. End of story.I kind of hate this location because it gets packed so early. I love Chipotle but everyone's office, including mine is right by it. I know I should get here by 11:30 or after 1 to avoid a crowd.  Also, I never get water here because it taste disgusting! It's so weird!More of a 2.5 but I'll give it three because the owner was nice. She clearly knew almost everyone coming in and out of the place and had lots of repeat customers. 

The place is dank and the plastic red table cloths are sticky. The mural is very cheesy and now well-painted. The owner is nice but I have smelled few people who emanate the smell of cigarettes more strongly. It is awful and it made us feel a bit sad/depressed for her. It made the place seem gloomier. And it is NOT appetizing. 

The cheese sticks were ok and the sauce served with them was passable. The pizza was sort of ehhhh...The cheese quality was a bit low and the sauce just didn't work that well as a pizza sauce. Crust was cooked well and had a bit of crisp on the bottom. 

I would not come back here. It was middling at best and a bit depressing.I have been taking my friend who is 91, with Alzheimers,  to this nail salon for years.  It's larger than it looks from the outside.  I don't think they are as sophisticated as some but  that's ok.  What I do appreciate is the way they take the time to continue making it a good experience for my friend.  Maybe I tip them to much.  As long as they continue the service, I will pay.I really want this place to be more than exceptional but after the second visit (months after the first) I can only say this:  you pay too much for the view.
The service is very old-fashioned and very doting but the menu needs a re-think.  Times have changed but this place is stuck in the 90's.  bottom line, it is an overly expensive resort restaurant with OK food and exhorbitant prices.I sit here writing this from the waiting room at approximately 3:15 pm, while I wait to speak with the only home loan person for BoA in the area. My appointment was at 3:00. Normally it wouldn't be a big deal, but when I got here my customary 5-10 minutes early, I just so happened to sit next to the guy ahead of me, whose appointment was at 2:00. That's about 55 minutes late for those trying to keep up with all the numbers.

A few minutes ago, roughly 3:05, I was acknowledged and told she was running "a little behind." The acknowledgement was appreciated and saved a 2-star rating.  Knowing he was an hour past his appointment, I asked for a guess at how long it would be, to which I was assured "about 30 minutes."   He was finally called back shortly after that, and I continue to wait.

I've been with Bank of America for somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 years or more.  I like the bank, and the people at this location and most of the ones I dealt with in Florida are friendly.  However, I can't help but feel it's not too much to ask for a simple phone call to let someone know when you're running 30-60 minutes behind. 

While the company as a whole I would rate 4 stars, this branch doesn't quite make that level, and hence the 3-star rating.  Before you think me to picky based on a single experience, I'd like to note I've been irritated here before.  In addition to the time issues I experienced today, I've also found certain others at this location to be a little pushy when it comes to Bank offered services (credit cards, retirement plans, etc). I realize this is probably a system thing and not a location thing, but it hasn't been like this at other branches.

I'm finishing this up, now the 30 minutes later I was told, and eagerly await my turn so I can finish up and enjoy the rest of my day off. Fortunately they seems to be wrapping up.  I may update further at a later time pending the outcome here.Service is very nice. Chimi was a little too deep fried. Burrito was ok. Every bite seemed uneven....Taste was average but still good. Price was good. I'd consider going here again for some easy Mexican food.My brother proudly hates this store. Yet almost every year when I buy him things from there for Christmas or his Birthday - he totally loves them.  Every time.  

As he's gotten a bit older there is less for him here except t-shirts, but during his 13-16 years this was the ultimate stop for his Christmas stocking.  Funny t-shirts, buttons w/ funny sayings, cool notebooks, fun character stuff from the newest "cool" tv show.  Even pencils with cool stuff on them.  Once he found out where some of them were from because he said I shouldn't have even gone in there because he hates that store, but by that point he loved what I'd gotten him enough that it was assumed that must have been the ONLY cool think in there.  

If you don't have a teenager, or someone who lives at least a part of their life like a teenager, don't bother to go in the store.  But for those who love Family Guy, feel a little goth or emo now and then or just want to find a cool band concert shirt so they'll be hip with the ladies - this isn't an all bad place to go.Go Go China - where do I begin?

Food overall is pretty good.  Is it real chinese?  It would be your typical american style chinese.  Is it the best you've ever had?  Not necessarily, but pretty good considering there are very few good chinese take out places in the area (and Phoenix, for that matter).  I totally dig the hot and sour soup.  Other dishes are very flavorful (unlike a lot of bland chinese I've had in the valley) and I feel they go the extra mile where other places cut corners any way they can.  People there are friendly, and I always make it a point to say hi to who I believe is the owner and his wife that cook in the back.

I've seen people comment before on their health department reviews, which like any restaurant has had their share of infractions.  And don't believe just because the health dept. hasn't found them doesn't mean they exist if you think your favorite restaurant is squeaky clean.  I'm the kind of person that doesn't obsess about sanitation especially when facing a great meal of street tacos, take out chinese, or whatever. 

You do not want to dine inside.  This place is strictly take-out.  Sure, you could eat there if you want, but it is COMPLETELY devoid of any atmosphere.  The tables are really just for people waiting to get their food to go.

They also deliver, and have an extensive menu.  There are some good appetizers mixed with cantonese, mandarin, szechwan, and hunan-style dishes.

Prices are very affordable too, and they have coupons frequently.I have been in and out of this airport for years. And never once did I realize that the terminal is equipped with free wifi. Every single time I come here, I always plug in my air data card only to watch it crap out after 15 minutes and then reboot so that I can get back on line.

Well right now as of this writing, I am online and taking full advantage of the free wifi here. 

My flight is delayed.

My Starbucks hot cocoa tastes odd (all airport Starbucks taste funny)

The airport provides H1N1 flu shots on the departure level. 

The smell of the Nathans Hot Dog stand is very inviting.Decent airport and they have Carvel!Decent airport. Not much selection in food, but the wi-fi is fast and the terminal is pretty wide which reduces congestion.I wasn't here very long, but I was able to find some good food & drink easily!This review is for making connections, as I've never used this airport as my arrival/departure point. But this airport is huge!! Do not book tight connections through here, unless you are positive that you are in the same concourse and that gates won't change (which you will never predict). Takes a good 15-20 minutes walking to get from one end to the other, which is usually not a problem, but again, don't make tight connections through here. 

I don't feel like PHX has too much of a personality. Busy and hectic, yes, but compared to other west coast airports like lets say San Diego or San Francisco, this one is very no-frills. Food options are there, but nothing that really stands out.Wow this place was packed for a Thursday night. With a half an hour wait I was expecting great things. Everything was just average. The chips were greasy and the salsa wasn't anything to write home about. The pricing is very reasonable. The Carne Asada was thick but very chewy, not the best piece of meat. The frozen margarita was very good and I had a bite of someone's tamale and tostada and those were both very good. The ambiance is more of what people go for I think. The interior is very cozy and welcoming like someone's home.We didnt feel like going out and decided to order in.  Compared to most delivery restaurants of this style, we were happy not to get a salt bomb for a meal.  Only quibbles were ordering two larges and only getting one rice and their online menu not being accurate with regards to pricing.  Good flavor on the Kung pao.They need a seperate cyclist trail or ban the 10 speeds from flying down the road.  They are more dangerous than the cars with no regard for vehicles or pedestrians.  Went up to the observation area.  Of course there are people hocking jewelry, their kids tearing up anything that will come loose and elders sitting in the shade, drinking from paper bags. 

The view is nice, and trails are great for exercise. People suckI've been wanting to try Los Taquitos even before I knew it had been on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and I finally got the chance.  The inside it exactly what I expected, nothing fancy, booths and some tables.  I found it a little odd that the counter where you order is so small and the drink lids, napkins, condiments and plasticware are right next to it.  If there had been a line it would have been very awkward.  I ordered a chicken burrito, enchilada style with rice and beans and a drink.  When I went to get my drink they were out of Diet Coke, it came out as just water.  Ok, I thought maybe they had been super busy as it was about 1pm on a weekday.  Lunch rush perhaps.  I took a seat and waited for my number to be called.  The burrito was good, nothing that knocked my socks off but a decent burrito.  The rice was nice and fluffly but the beans just lacked flavor.  They were blah.  Will I come back?  Sure but I will try the tacos next time and hope that they can rearrange that counter a bit.Interesting place to visit with friends...could talk and look at Phoenix from above....large portions...ok food..good service...good bread pudding
Handy van service from Arizona grand resort ....smelly animal..I think a bull...at entrance...I guess it is the Western flavorA solid 3 stars. Neat concept. Pretty good food but it was hit or miss. Our order is as follows:

* Complimentary Bread Basket - biscuits and fried Mexican bread. It was just ok. 
* Fried Rattlesnake and Cactus appetizer - it was good, though we liked the cactus a bit more than the rattlesnake. Rattlesnake was nothing special but a must try for us since we love trying new things. 
* Entrees include Beans, Family style salad, and cotton candy - beans were not good. Salad was very tasty. And who doesn't like cotton candy?
* Mixed Grill entree with Filet Medallions and Ribs - pretty good. Ribs were tasty. 
* Rustler's Cut - definite pass! First time my steak came out dry dry dry and was sent back. 2nd time they brought it out first bite was good and manager came to ask about it. He left, I took a second bite and reached a very raw steak. I guess they tried to cook it too fast and only 'seared' the outside. At that point I was pretty full so didn't say anything. 

Service: Our original waitress was flighty and couldn't seem to concentrate. Took bf's order then ran off. Brought us the salad and I had to ask to put my order in. Come our entrees and they brought out 3 plates... Wtf? Never came by to refill anything. Thankfully another nice waiter jumped in after seeing our frustration. From then on smooth sailing.My opinion of CPK:

Quinoa & arugula salad was outstanding. The fish tacos are skimpy. One taco had 2 pieces of fish that were roughly the size of fish sticks. The other taco had 2 teeny weeny pieces of fish. I don't like to complain about my food or send it back for fear of having someone spit in it, but the teeny pieces were unacceptable. Our server brought out lots of extra fish at no additional charge.

CPK gets 3 stars for the salad.The staff here changes frequently. It is a favorite spot for my kids. Great place for the kids to make gifts and also great for birthday parties.I really wanted to LOVE Roy's, but it just didn't do it for me.  It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either.  I left feeling very "meh."

My husband and I were staying at the JW with a Travelzoo deal, and we had been wanting to try Roy's since we live very close anyway, but never had the chance.  So we figured why not.  We were greeted and seated right on time in a very private booth indoors.  The weather was nice enough to sit outside, but everyone was outside and we wanted a more romantic dinner rather than having to listen to everyone else's conversations and screaming kids.  

Our server was really great - knowledgeable, attentive but not overbearing, and I wish I could remember his name.  We started with our drinks...my husband ordered his typical Jack and Diet and I ordered a glass of wine.  I wasn't impressed with the wine menu, however, as I was trying to decide between two different glasses, our server brought me tastes of both options, which was a really nice touch.  

We had the lobster potstickers for an appetizer, which I really enjoyed.  However, as others have mentioned, the portions are very small for what you are paying.  I rolled my eyes at those reviews before I dined here, but having experienced it now, I can confirm that really, they are small.  It wouldn't have bothered me if I paid $15 for 3 bites and those bites were the most amazing flavors I've ever tasted, but that was not the case.  

Moving on to dinner - I ordered the Roy's Trio, which included 2.5 oz servings of the salmon, mahi, and butterfish, and some rice.  Again, very small portion.  Although I was satisfied with the amount of food, my husband was not.  I like the butterfish very much and wished I had ordered that as my entree.  The other two were just "meh" as far as flavor for me.  My husband had the Ahi and he liked it but didn't love it (story of the evening).

We finished with the chocolate lava cake.  Great decision.  It was soooo good.  We aren't big chocolate people, but it just sounded good that night and boy are we glad we ordered it.  SO YUMMY.

I would have really liked Roy's if they had been priced just a little lower - I don't think my entree was worth paying more than $25 or so.  I have spent the same amount of money on the same amount of food (appetizer to share, entrees, dessert to share) at much nicer restaurants, which is really what is holding me back from liking Roy's more.  I would tell people to try it for yourself, but for us, it was fine but just didn't live up to expectations.I leased my Audi in California, but brought it to North Scottsdale for service once I moved here earlier this year.  The staff was nice and polite, but the account manager didn't really listen to me.  I complained about some shaking I experienced every time I put my year-old A4 in reverse or was moving at slow speeds.  When I picked the car up, the account manager wasn't available, so the person at the front desk told me the car was ready to go.  As soon as I drove off, it was clear that the car had the same problem and was not fixed so I returned to the dealership and dropped the car off.  After a number of times following up the next day, I was told they ran tests, the car was fine, and they did not experience any shaking.  When I went to pick the car up, I asked the account manager to drive with me so I can show him what I was talking about.  He then told me that I wasn't using the correct technical language, and that it was a power steering issue.  They kept my car over the weekend to order a replacement hose, which was done promptly.    

I have to take my car in for alignment this weekend, so I'm trying Audi Chandler instead.I've been a member for a year on their group plan, and I go to the range once a month. In terms of the people working at the front counter, I'm not really a fan. They tend to be fairly cold and will help regulars that they recognize before you. If I bring a friend, sometimes they'll charge a $10 guest fee and other times they won't. The selection of rental firearms is fairly small; not nearly enough especially when I was hoping to try some before buying. One of their weird rules is that you have to buy their paper target and you can't bring your own; I still cannot think of a logical reason for this.

I've never felt fully safe here because they don't require any signing and understanding of rules. Some places like Scottsdale Gun Club require new shooters to watch a video about basic firearms safety and sign a waiver. I trust myself but I'm wary about some of the people that shoot here. It's surprising that it's easier to rent a gun here than it is to play paintball at one of the local fields. 

Conversely, I took their 7-hour CCW course that was on special and had a great experience. The instructor, J.R. Robie was extremely knowledgeable, funny, and an effective teacher. I would definitely take additional courses from him. 

In summary, this could be a terrific shooting range if the employees were trained better in customer service and they instituted better safety rules. They'd do well to replicate what Scottsdale Gun Club has going for it.Well after reading the reviews I decided to check out this new to me sushi joint.  I am a hard judge on sushi as I am from Seattle and have eaten a lot of fresh and amazing rolls.

With that said on to the review.  I just thought this place was eh.  I started with the usual pot-stickers which were totally pre-frozen like I can get at the store and make at home.  -1 star

Next I got my Miso soup it was typical miso so nothing to cheer or talk bad about. 

Finally my two rolls came out.  I ordered both off the special rolls list.  First was the Dec. 29th roll.  I asked about why it was called that and my waitress seemed like I was the first to ever ask that and had no answer other than that's what it's always been called. -1 star.  It was ok decent flavor and decent presentation lots of rice.  

Last roll comes out and it's my baked CH3.  I learned why the 3 was in the name there were only 3 pieces for $8.95.  I was a bit disappointed then I took a bite.  It totally made up for it the baked Halibut and crab and avocado exploded goodness in my mouth and I was happy this was my finale.  

So overall it's not bad but totally not in my top 5 best sushi places in Phoenix and surrounding areas.  If your close stop in try the CH3 roll and you will probably leave happy.Red Robin is one of those places that takes me back to my childhood. Growing up in the Seattle area, it was one of those fun places that we always went for birthdays or just special nights out. It was a real treat to go to the original location and when I turned 21, my girlfriends and I found ourselves sitting out on the Seattle waterfront far too often.

Fast forward to 2013...when did this place get so freaking expensive?! I'm not sure why I am surprised, but I am. Just like every other mediocre chain restaurant, prices go up, service and quality go down. I'm left with serious eating remorse and I'm kicking myself for dropping $45 on a meal last night that could have been spent in one of our far superior local establishments.

I have been getting the Bleu Ribbon Burger since it was introduced to the menu years ago, but last night I didn't feel like spending $10.79 on one burger so I went with the Patty Melt. It was good enough, and I was pleased. I do love the Red Robin fries and I'm a sucker for their honey mustard. I finished my basket of food and I was actually pretty full. Maybe I didn't need that big burger after all.

My husband had the Veggie Burger. Kids had the Pizza and the Mac and Cheese. No complaints.

Our waitress was nice and fairly attentive. It wasn't busy and we were seated right away. Drinks took longer than usual to come out but that's because our waitress dropped my husband's beer. No big deal, accidents happen. I had a good view of the kitchen and watched one worker stand around and play on his phone for a good chunk of time we were there. (Employees on their cell phones while working really irks me). We were seated under the air conditioning so it was really cold. (Someone once told me that keeping a restaurant really cold was a way to move people out quicker. Not sure if that's what they were going for, but it's always on my radar now.)

I'd like to say that I have learned my lesson, but I'm sure I will be back because my memories of the past always seem to win.Come here a lot. Love the tilapia which my mom order. My sister have the steak gorgonzola and she love it. I like my berry freshca. The food is great. But the service is bad. Usually the service is the best here. But this time it is horrible. The guy doesn't even care. He let us wait and never come by and ask how we are. I know they are busy but we never ask for anything. Even when he bring put the dishes, he just shove it to our face while talk to the others. Wow what a nice service attitude?Pizza doesn't thril me, but this Streets of New York is better than most. The ham and pineapple thin crust was close to perfect (but canadian bacon costs twice as much as ham??). It did suffer a bit from "underdone middle", like so many thin crusts do. Overall, a pizza I'd eat again.

Along with the pizza, they gave us (and everybody else, apparently) some bread "chunks" with marinara. Each was a bite-sized piece of crust, baked and dusted with parmesan (I think). They tasted good, but I wish they had asked if we wanted it, since our basket pretty much went to waste.

The interior is nicely decorated, not too cramped and not too overly filled with pictures and wall objects selected carefully by corporate marketing specialists. The waitress was patient with our inability to decide on a pizza, and she was definitely attentive to our needs throughout the meal.I always want to call this place banana bucks. I got the peach and blue raspberry shaved ice and it was okay. Not a big fan of this kind of shaved ice but everyone raved so I had to try it. The best shaved ice is made in Asia, its not syrup based, and won't turn your teeth blue. Rumor has it that the closest place worth going to is called fluff ice in CA.Fundito was good...not great.  I got it with pork.  The pork was cooked perfectly...nice and moist.  

My wife's bean & cheese burrito was bland (at best).  She wasn't impressed at all.

The salsas (both mild and hot) were flavorless and runny.  The hot tasted like Ketchup with a small bit of spice.  We even had some of the bean dip...not so good.  The chips were greasy too.

Valle Luna used to be some of the *BEST* Mexican food around... What happened?!?!?!?!Decided on going here tonight with family. Got a table pretty quick. Was prolly 15 mins before the waiter acknowledged, then about 5 more mins until he came back to take our drink and dinner order. Well 35mins later the food arrives, but during the wait not a single word from waiter as to why so long. The waiter during the meal never checked back to see how everything was. VERY poor service this visit. We go here on a regular basis and we are very disappointed.

We ended up talking with the manager about the server, he was very sorry that we had a bad experience and he took care of some of the items on the bill and offered dessert.

Food as always is very good and we plan on still going there for our monthly Fundido fix,it's really hard to write a review for a great clips. basically it comes down to the person doing the cutting and styling. I do like the staff at this one location.. well, most of the staff.

what I do not like about most great clips, is that they always ask for phone number. I almost never have my own cell phone as I use a company phone most times. I also don't have a home phone. over the years i have accumulated many numbers and though I've been to the same place for 10 years now, when there are new staff, they always ask me if I'm new there.

anyways, long story short, its the luck of the draw with your stylist, but most I don't mind.Pierre, with comments like that i have no choice LOL 

Swaddee is OK. See, there i did not say it sux or not worth it. You happy now? LOL ;)

Yeah, its alright. Been there bunch of times for lunch from work and once for dinner. Dinner was better. Lunch is fine. Do not believe their star rating, 5 will NOT burn your eyes out. 

Now, is it best Thai ever? Noup, it aint. Is it best in the neighborhood? MAYBE! However is you are willing to go a few miles West into Foothills you will find Thai Basil which i think quite a bit better. 

Now, there we have it. Efff me and my effing opinions :)

"Its awight"

EugeneIts what you expect, burgers and fries.

But wait, there is more now.  There are sweet potato fries.  Yes, you heard it here first - sweet potato fries - yum.

I find the drinks fun to look at and yummy to drink but a bit on the pricey side.

Here's another great hint - they have smaller portion burgers!  I can never finish the whole regular burger so this is a great deal.

Comfortable easy place to be.  Someday I'll save room for dessert.I would give it 3 1/2 stars. I am putting 3 because I just can't give it 4 but I feel bad giving it 3. It is good but not the greatest. For fast food it is a little step above bigger chains. It is kind of clean and kind of local. 
The Green Chili Double is really good. Sometimes they are hotter then others it depends on the chili but that is a good thing because at lest you know they are using real chilies and not some lab created trickery. Even a regular Whataburger Double with cheese is good. The fries are good too. They just aren't blow your mind good. Plus they have a rep for being a little on the dirty side. Just a little nothing to get them shut down just not white glove clean as some other places. Also they are just a few dollars more expensive then the regular fast food place.
I would go again and I have once in a long while. Just not the first choice with so many other great places to choose from but still a choice.Loved the system they used for the midnight showing of Dark Knight, and I would not be surprised if all theaters start using this method.  They were showing the movie on 8 screens, and had about 3 auditoriums open by 9pm, so people could just walk right in any of them and pick their seat.  No waiting in line!   My main complaint would be the temperature.  I am used to theaters usually being a little on the chilly side, but this one was way warm.  It was also disappointing that there was no pre-show entertainment\ads whatsoever.  It was a black screen up until the previews started.  I imagine this had something to do with the fact that they were busy with showing one movie on 8 screens, but I was quite bored with the black screen and wanted them to show some cool stuff to keep me entertained like Cinemark Theaters does.  Overall the experience was fine but nothing special.The food is legit but really- it's expensive!  I hate sounding like a cheap ass but we cook at home A LOT and our food is REALLY GOOD. So- we are tough critics especially with mexican food. All that being said- it is authentic and good.  It's just expensive.  The salsa is weak-sauce. Tapatio is spicier.  I asked the lady in the kitchen for a sprinkle of queso fresco on my carne asada tacos and she straight up had the audacity to say, "It's an extra $2.50 for the cheese, is that okay?" I said. NO thank you- I don't want $2.50 sprinkles of cheese.??!?!!?!? who charges that much for cheese? I could buy a damn block for that price. Their chicken soup is dope though!!!!I stopped in here to find a supplement that the Muscle Max store next to Gold's didn't have. My husband likes Hi Health because he says it's cheaper than GNC. 

I went in and found the employees to be very helpful and friendly (without being over-bearing). The store offers a buy one get the second half off for many things in the store, every day. Pretty cool. It wasn't valid on my supplement but was for the liquid vitamin I bought. 

When I cashed out, the girl gave me some good tips on my supplement that I didn't know before, so I really appreciated that.Still one of the best places on earth to buy toys and video games.  Their selection is great and usually they have great sales right before major holidays.Dont drink the martinis.  Ick.  Two for one?  I couldnt even get through my first.  Way too sweet and where is this booze you speak of?  And yes, Kristin, sticky hands!!!  Gross.  

Actually my thoughts on Devils North are very similar to Kristin's...  I cant figure out why/if I like this place.  It really does have a ton of potential and some really great bathrooms and you know how that scores big points with me.  But the music is way off (we definitely thought "wedding music" at some points last night) and the crowd doesnt hold a candle to the Old Town location's clientele.  Older, worse dancers, and 30 somethings trying to relive their 20s.  Annoying.  

Why is everyone so damn drunk (and thus, yes, humping each others legs...I saw that too, WTF)??  Thursday happy hour.  Look past the faux fancy martini menu and go for whatever usually floats your boat.  EVERYTHING is 2 for 1 all night long.  

The food is actually pretty good too if you need some sustanance...they have some ridiculous deal for happy hour like you can pick 3 tapas/salads for $12 or something.  Go ahead and eat, or after your third double Goose and soda you might be the one humping legs on the dance floor.  

Good layout of the bar, dont have to wait too long for drinks, clean bathrooms with attendant, usually free bottled water on the way out.  No cover before 10pm...$10 for guys after 10pm.I love  coming to this cafe. There service is real good and there food / smoothies are so yummy. It's a quiet place to come read a book or work on your laptop.Hello Yelp'ers,

Came here today while I was at a conference and had some drinks with my team. 

They had a GREAT happy hour and good drinks.  

however, my big complaint was the mens restroom.  While some good decorations, it stunk to high hell.  Really killed my happy hour mood due to the stench. 

Went back to the hotel to commence drinks. 

Happy yelping,I am a bit disappointed by this place recently because part of their appeal to me is that they stay open later than any other decent place in the neighborhood. However on at least 3 occasions recently I tried to go here after 10 at night before 10:30 when they say they close and found a closed restaurant. Major bummer especially since on at least one of the occasions I would have stopped somewhere else on my way home if I had known Rays would not really be an option.Like the other reviewer... yup... its a Subway. 

It's always clean, plenty of parking, and this particular location is never very busy.

I love the $5 Footlongs... can't beat it when I don't feel like cooking.Big City Bagels does a very nice job.

Now that Brooklyn Bagels (Desert Ridge) is closed, Big City is the only game in North Scottsdale.  They tend make what I call plump bagels.  In other words, you might not see an opening in the middle.  But they are great for making sandwiches and tasty too.

If you are an early riser, I would highly recommend coming here early and getting the bagels when they're still toasty hot.  The smells inside the store are amazing and don't forget to get your card stamped.

Enjoy!I love their selection of salads even more so then Paradise Bakery which I am also a big fan of, and I loved their sweet potato sandwich! I also enjoy that they have pasta dishes to choose from. I am a huge fan of both Wildflower and Paradise Bakery for Fast Foods.It's what i've come to expect from WF, although this store felt a little cluttered. I hit up the salad bar which was varied, but not as extensive as other WF's. The cheese section was not very impressive. I may checkout the one in Chandler.This is generally a kind of scary creepy mall I avoid but now that I'm growing a human being and can no longer do Pilate's, stand up paddle-boarding or run and have gained an insane amount of weight, I walk (or waddle) around malls for exercise and for the price of a 25 cent bouncy ball at Old Navy and a penny to toss in the water at Rainforest Cafe, I can get my sweet pea to walk with me, gleefully even.so awesome coming here after bar like timeout or monkey pants closes.  I come from a place where there are NO 24 hour burrito places and to me this is stuff of legend.  

$4 for a gigantic burrito.

Get the Cali/Arizona burrito.  SO GOOD.  I cannot confirm or deny the cleanliness of the place.Everytime I come to this Applebee's location I'm treated like precious cargo. 

Really. 

I've never had a waiter/waitress here that didn't exemplify utmost amazingness. This time I was waited on by an Italian Irish fellow named Ryan. And I must say Ryan was the shit.

But why three stars? Well it is a restaurant. And a crucial part of any restaurant is food. Applebee's food sucks. Everytime I go, no matter the location, the food sucks. 

And the drinks...the detail that means the most to me...suck. I had two fishbowls. 2 fishbowls!!! I should have been woozy, dizzy, happy...anything to show I had consumed alcohol, but all I felt was the need to drink water to erase some of the super sugary taste out of my mouth.

I mean really Applebee's! Club bees! Mistah Apple! 

You disappoint me.Beautiful landscaping...  love this resort hotel... I spent 2 nights here following my husband on his business trip. Driving into hotel, I am amazed with the landscaping of desert atmosphere. They don't have executive lounge but gave us breakfast vouchers good for continental breakfast only, adding $5 for hot breakfast. The room is not quite impressive... outdated looking.. but with patio. The pool are big enough separated between smoking and non-smoking with the slider. But the water is connected floating between the two areas but not really clean. There are so many leaves and dead insects in it. I just enjoyed being outside walking along the trail from my room to the pool and around.I honestly was not impressed with their award winning wings. They were too small, barely covered in sauce, and even the sauce was nothing impressive. The bad tasting ice over powered the flavor of my sons Shirley temple. But service was great, environment was fun, lots of different shows on the tv's. I could see coming here for drinks with the crew would be fun here :)This was the first Carl's Jr I ever ate at.  The Realtor showing me rental houses back in '93 took me here for lunch.  The lunch was fine.  The only property he showed me that would accept pets I filled out the paperwork for only to find out cats are not pets according to that owner.  I also forgot my hat as we left.  Even though I drive by it several times a week I seldom stop as it doesn't fit my schedule.

This morning I had their breakfast burger, which I have had before, and with beef, bacon, egg, hashbrowns and stuff it really is a breakfast on a bun.  Even at 6AM on a Saturday they were doing a steady stream of business at the drive through but only one other customer at the walk up counter.  I am sure this location has been remodeled since my first visit over 16 years ago.  It is in very god condition.Ate here as a late night meal while I was in Phoenix for a race. It was suggested by the concierge at our hotel. The food was decent a but overpriced for the quality but the ambience was mellow and nice. As you can see from my review... it was a pretty bland experience, but not bad.We have been going to OLd Chicago for many years. Just never wrote a review?? The food is always OK. Service can very from time to time. The decor has not changed over the years. Probably is time for a face lift. Basically a sports bar pizza place decor. They have many beers to drink. I am not a beer drinker so that is not attraction to my. Meals are larger than you probably eat at a sitting. My wife and I usually split a meal. If you are into sports it is a good place to watch your favorite team while you eat. Very kid friendly and there is plenty of room for a large party.We've been looking for a teppanyaki place in our neck of the woods but were a little leery of this place from the old "drive by" since it's in a strip mall in an older building.  This was nonsense however, because inside the place ended up being pretty interesting and delightful.  Sure, it's an older building but the place seemed really clean, the bathrooms were well kept and here's the BONUS - they got the long fountain / fish pond working and filled with fish (and turtles!).  It's quite unique - check out the pics here on yelp.

We came for teppanyaki and were seated right away and only had to wait a few minutes for the other half of the grill table to fill up.  My husband opted for sushi instead and ordered a rainbow roll.  He said it was good, not the best he'd had, but that it was pretty sizeable and filled him up.

My daughter and I had teppanyaki - she ordered shrimp and I had steak & lobster - yum!  (c'mon this was a Mother's Day celebration...)  The chef was really young but he was quite funny and obviously talented.  He was flipping rice clumps into our mouths (I caught it - yay!) lighting onion volcanoes, tossing prank eggs at us (empty shells) and making Nemo jokes - my daughter loved it!  He cooked everything really well and made the evening so special.  

They sang for about 4 birthdays while we were there, they were enthusiastic and the birthday havers seemed really ecstatic - they brought some special fruit plate type of desert thing out.

The ice tea wasn't so good but the turtles made up for that - let's hear it for turtles!It's Denny's.  I've eaten at this one for many years, and through several changes in management, simply because it is conveniently located near my house.   The restaraunt is laid out well, with two main wings (one of which used to be smoking back in the day) so things don't get to noisy, even if it is crowded.   

Food is adequate for Denny's (their pancakes and sandwiches have always been pretty tasty) though the quality of the service tends to be a dice roll depending on if you get a new server or not.   This location is generally kept clean so as long as you aren't expecting the world, it's a good place to hit when you want the sit down experience but don't have a lot of extra money to spend.We just sort of ended up here.   This one is full of the old folks with coupons and oxygen tanks from Sun City. Dinner here starts at 3:00PM.  We usually sit at the bar and just enjoy some appetizers and drinks.  They have some decent mixed drinks and some tasty apps.  The bartenders are great and appreciate when young'uns like us show up.    There's always better seafood out there, but in a pinch Red Lobster is solid and will suffice.Great food, service really needs work.  

We were  there for a late lunch, less than a dozen tables occupied and quite a high number of servers, and yet still waited almost fifteen mins for our drinks (water and pop). Service got progressively better with the meal once we complained but was only marginal at best by the end. 

The food itself was superb - excellent grilled chicken sandwich and one of the best French dips we have had in almost 30 years since a little old ma and pop shop our family used to frequent back in MN. 

A little pricey given the portions and the service is a definite negative,  but a decent choice in the area if you have the time and patience.We ordered delivery and got the Family Dinner B with shrimp in lobster sauce, pepper beef, bbq pork fried rice, steamed rice and it came with 2 egg rolls, 2 crab rangoons, 2 fried shrimp and wonton soup for $26.95 which I thought was a good deal. The food was good, not excellent. Not a lot of shrimp in the shrimp & lobster sauce, mostly on top rather than mixed in. The crab rangoons were very good and we received 4 free. My only major complaint would be that the wonton soup has entirely too much cabbage in it. I would say half of the container was just chunks of cabbage. Other than that delivery was relatively quick and it was good enough to order from again.I got my oil changed in 30 minutes.  It was quick, painless, and I wasn't "hussled".  They mentioned I would want to replace something but they didn't try and force me to do it then and there.  I also got my oil change through groupon so it was nice to see a big company like Midas giving out discounts!Sure, it's a chain restaurant, but I love having late breakfasts here with friends (avoid groups of more than six; it's hard to get them seated on a busy weekend).  I even like ducking in and sitting at the breakfast bar for a quick brunch.  The place is packed on the weekends.  My favorite breakfast dish there is a riff on eggs benedict; crab cakes (instead of an english muffin), topped with spinach, a poached egg and hollandaise sauce. It's served with red potatoes or fruit.  They also have a really nice oatmeal served with brown sugar, raisins, nuts - a high water mark on the comfort food chart for me.Our food was served fresh and fast! Amongst our group, we had an apple turnover which has delicious frosting, jalepeno poppers, Reubens, a roast beef sandwich, a couple of shakes, and fries. They only had one apple turnover left so we had to split one. The chocolate shake was really a vanilla shake with chocolate syrup squirted in for decoration. The rest of the food was incredible! Totally bummed about the shake and turnover..... Maybe next time.DISCLAIMER: This review is based on one and only one trip to Chipotle

For literally years, I have heard great things about Chipotle. There never seems to be a Chipotle location close to my work or home though. Recently I had a lunch time appointment just  up the street from this Chipotle so I decided to give them a try.

Chipotle shares a parking lot with numerous other businesses, and the parking lot set up leaves a lot to be desired. I managed to snag the only open spot in front of the store, but can see how the parking situation here could be really aggravating. 

Walking in, I was greeted by what seemed like every employee working and half of the line of customers. The noise level was ridiculous, being a Chipotle virgin I had to respond with 'What?' to every question the employees asked about how I wanted my meal. It got annoying really quickly.

I got my meal and a coworkers meal to go. Total damage for two burrito bowls, nothing else, was over $15! My food was good, but overall I am left rather unimpressed by Chipotle. The menu seemed limited, the prices seemed to be on the high side and the ambiance of this particular location was lacking.... I wouldn't rush back.Cheap lunch specials... They give alot for just $5.95 includes corn egg drop soup with your meal!
I had the mangolian beef w/ white rice... beef was tender and tasty...  Definitely can be shared with 2 people.Its only an Arbys. So this will only be a quick review.

 No matter where we live in Las Vegas we have an Arbys within a 10 minute drive. Years ago, Arbys left the New York City market. Now that they opened a store in Bellmore, NY; New Yorkers are driving a distance for the Arbys experience. The Arbys of today is a different restaurant than I remember in New York. They greatly eliminated their popular signature menu items for new market fresh items. Maybe the Wendy's merger had something to do with it. Delicious menu items like the super beacon roast beef and cheeseburger (they had delicious cheeseburgers) have been replaced by reubens, roast turkey, and other market sandwiches that remind me more of Wendys. 

Fortunately,  they still serve the beacon cheddar roast beef sandwich. That is my Arby's sandwich of choice. My critique is that they not charge an extra dollar for more roast beef.

  This Arbys shares the parking lot with Pecos Legacy Car Wash. After scrubbing off presents from pigeons and the elements,  eating here is a nice reward for hand washing my car. Thats all I have to say.

Yelp Challenge: Review 41 of 100.Kohl's is a great store when it comes to value. The store on Valley Verde is enormous and right off the 215 East. 

Nice staff 
Great Value
Name BrandsOriginally, we wanted to eat some Thai Style Noodle House.  To our dismay, they were closing in 10 minutes when we arrived.  So, off we trecked to the next Asian restaurant and landed in Pho Kim Long.

One thing about this place is that it's open 24 hours a day and I was informed that they are the only pho place that has these hours.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.  It was my bf, and two of our friends who shared this experience with us.  I never really know what to order from here so I had our friend order for  me.  
 
When the bowl came my way, I was very excited as I'd never had it before.  I believe it was pho with some kind of beef balls.  There were other meats in there but I forgot to ask what type it was.  The broth was good without the extra sauces that people normally put in there.  When adding the bean sprouts, mint, and jalapeno's the kick it gives is a whirlwind of pleasures in your tongue.

My boyfriend ordered the fried rice.  The color was somewhat orangey-yellow.  We've never had anything like it.  Per our friend, the way it's made is the cook adds just the yolk to give it that sunshine color.  It's definitely different but I can't say I'd order it for myself in the future.  The other dish we had was a spicy tofu.  That was really addicting.  Normally, tofu doesn't blend well with anything because of how bland it is.  But, they added the right amount of spice to give it a pleasing taste.

The atmosphere of the whole restaurant was very relaxed.  Most people come here to sober up after a wild night at a club or bar.  It only makes sense.Pho Kim long. Fun e nam! Don't you think? Well if your a local or party with locals chances are you will probably end up here after a night out for some drunk munchies or after a wicked hangover sets in and your in dire need of liquids containing pho noodles.  The food good. The atmosphere is questionable. If you come here sober you'll probably run into someone you know who is plastered. Fun? Maybe. Enjoyable? That depends if you get anything good to use on them! Jk, sorta. 
Seriously though the food is good. Order something other than the pho you'll be surprised it's pretty damn good! I like the crab Rangoon and the peppered beef. 
Ooo and the Thai boba is yummy! Don't get the fruit flavored ones they use the artificial fruit stuff. 
The seating sucks and the bathroom is not so clean. If you like lots of ppl, a noisy restaurant, and pretty decent food than give pho Kim long a try. What could it hurt. I've def done worse drunk.I came here for a pharmacy conference this past weekend.  I can't say much about the prices of the rooms since my school covered for the cost.  My friends and I stayed in the one of the courtyard rooms and it was fine for me because rooms are just for sleeping anyway, especially if you're in Vegas.  The courtyard rooms are pretty much like the ones you would fine in your standard motel.  Clean but small so it got a little stuffy but after a few minutes of turning on the AC it was fine. 

It's cheaper because Palace Station is off the strip, so the money you end up saving goes to paying for taxi's unless you're bringing your own car. However, Palace Station does offer free shuttle service to the strip and McCarran airport so try and use that to your advantage.  Just ask the front desk for a list of shuttle times.

Overall decent hotel but not too sure that I would stay here again since it's not on the strip!

Tip: Must try the Osyter Bar!!
 http://www.yelp.com/biz/oyster-bar-las-vegas-2#hrid:VvO77AGRTQ-NjLJHTpGmRQI tried the Villa Pizza in this location today and it wasn't bad. I got a large 16" with sausage for $12.96 and it had good flavor, nothing incredible. I do want to mention they didn't do a very good job at cutting it, 1 of the pieces was an oddly shaped triangle but massive, took up the whole plate. So being that there was a huge piece, there also came a small piece with looked like it belonged on a 10" inch pie. Even though the cutting was bad, the pie was still good so I would go back sometime again.Not spectacular but it did fill the void. Had the 3 item meats (soya chicken, duck, cha siu) just ok. The wonton noodle soup was just ok too. Gai lan with oyster sauce was good but you can't screw that up. It's fast but not super cheap.So my friend and I were craving Hawaiian food and we ended up here. It didn't really hit the spot for what I was in the mood for. There wasn't actually that many Hawaiian choices, it was more Korean and some Chinese. 

They did give banchan, which was interesting. They had Vienna sausage as one, I wasn't quite sure how I felt about that. It felt kind of cheap. 

We ended up just getting a spamusubi and shared chicken katsu. The spamusubi could have used more sauce, there was very little and it just felt like eating spam and rice. My friend ended up just dipping it in the sauce of the banchan. The seaweed seemed like it was harder to eat than the ones I usually get at other places. The chicken katsu was okay, nothing amazing.

On the plus side, the service was really nice. They made sure we had what we needed, but it started to feel too attentive. Everyone in the restaurant left and my friend and I were the only ones in there with the employees. They all started to stare and if started to feel like they were trying to close or something. They weren't, I guess they were just staring.The food is average, nothing special =\ The person controlling the music wasn't soo good a lot of stop and play. One of the waitress was careless & just was like yea yea. The names on the menu was cool something different but that's about it =TJust as mentioned by other yelpers the layout is really weird.. Upon entering it's a immediately hallway directing you to go right, you would think once you enter the actual "restaurant" it would be one big open space, but you walk into another room where I think the sushi bar was and a few other tables. The rest of the restaurant is divided into rooms.. We had visitors from Canada with us and I almost felt embarrassed we took them to a odd restaurant such as this in a sketchyarea. We came on a Saturday afternoon as a party of 9. The major plus is that they offer their lunch specials 7 days a week, which is good considering other restaurants only offer deals on the weekdays. I ordered the bento "b" with chicken katsu as my main entree ($10). In addition, I ordered a tiger roll, made up of 4 pieces for $8. The bento included miso soup, gyoza, tempura, a tossed salad, and 2 pieces of CA roll. Everything was pretty standard, except the CA roll seemed a little heavy on the rice and less on the crab meat. I enjoyed the tiger roll and have nothing to complain about it. The piece used for the chicken was rather thin, but still a good size. And the tempura, was good because the batter was light and not overly greasy. The service was good for the most part as they refilled our waters regularly and were attentive to us. Nothing really stuck out to me and I don't live around here so I probably won't be back.My friend and I swung in her last night around 10:30 after a show at the Smith Center. Both of us had missed dinner and were starving. The place was pretty dark and empty looking but once inside we found three or four other tables of late night eaters. As a whole this place is kind of a greasy spoon and a bit sticky but that really didn't bother us. I ordered the waffle breakfast with eggs and sausage and the portion was huge. My friend got the same thing only with pancakes instead. We both really liked what we had and seriously loved the butter they used. The service was fine nothing good or bad to say about that and the price was right at $24 for both of our meals and two coffees. Certainly be someplace when a late night breakfast craving hits.I went here for breakfast the other day.  For typical Asian breakfast place it was ok.  I might just feel that way about Asian places because I'm use to it.  We ordered the soy milk, oil sticks, sweet tofu, Shanghai dumplings, and green onion pancake. The oil sticks were really oily, but that's kind of expected because of the name.  The sweet tofu was tofu covered in this sweet sauce thing which my friend really likes.  I think it tasted better at KJ's kitchen.  I loved the Shanghai dumplings.  I really like it when they're a bit juicier, though. The green onion pancakes were nice and crunchy and flakey.  My friend really liked this place, but he's not use to Asian breakfasts.  This place was okay, and I would come back here again.For some strange reason, I've always had something against Tea Station. The thing is, it's been such a long time since I last went, I don't really remember what it is. But it's something that has stuck in my mind for years and I avoided the place like the plague. Was it bad service? Reading other people's reviews, that could be it.

Anyway, I finally returned this evening to hang out with a friend. We didn't order anything demanding - just a couple of drinks. The waitress took our order quickly, the drinks came out in good time, and then they left us alone as we talked for a couple of hours. When it was time to leave, it was easy enough to flag the waitress down, get the check, and be on our way.

Other people have mentioned that their service has vastly improved. I'll second that. It certainly was fast, accurate, and then invisible when we didn't need them. I'll still choose other boba places during the day when everything is open, but if you need a late night fix or just a chill late night hangout spot, Tea Station is a solid choice.Following the CMYE: Yelp Night With Frankie Moreno, Diane and I left the Stratosphere Tower and headed as swiftly as we could to Roxy's to have a midnight dinner.  We were both starving--which was good, considering the size of Roxy's offerings.  I had never been here before, but liked it instantly.  As advertised, it indeed reflected the "50's with a Twist!"  And, the twist embraced really talented singing servers, some unusual sauces, and a dash of humor.  A strapping birthday boy had just turned 21 this night, and a female server, accompanied by patrons, serenaded him with the happy birthday song after he took a seat on the checkerboard floor in the center of the dining room.  Then she told him that as a present he could have a free glass of water!  And, the waitress just walked away. 

The singing of '50s hits was first rate--obviously a job requirement for all servers.  A new song was belted out about every 18 minutes.  And, there was even a lively duet.

A requested Vanilla Coke was quickly produced, and was very good.  Skin-on fries were not very hot and were hard and not very tasty.  But my half-pound Roxy's Ground Chuck Burger with Mushrooms and Swiss Cheese was medium rare as ordered and excellent.  To my own surprise, probably due to having had nothing to eat for over 9 hours, I had no trouble at all polishing off the large burger, that also contained a tomato slice, pickles, and lots of crunchy Iceberg Lettuce, in one fairly quick sitting.  But my burger looked diminutive compared to the huge 2-pound Rotunda Burger that I saw an optimistic diner try to consume at a neighboring booth.  He failed at the effort, because I saw him leave soon afterward with a to-go box.  I also enjoyed a side of creamy Cole Slaw, and some Chipotle Aioli along with tomato ketchup and mild mustard to dress up my burger. 

Diane's Hot Fudge Milkshake was pretty good but much thinner and not on the same plane as the superb shakes that had graced my lips at Steak 'n Shake inside South Point.  On the other hand, my burger this night was far superior to the medium-well, thin twin-pattied Original Double Steakburger with Cheese I had quickly gulped down at Steak 'n Shake.  

Although I really liked the restaurant's ambiance, and my singing server was proficient and ready to please, there were a couple of problems that we encountered.  Soon after I sat down I noticed that some hard gunk from a prior spilled milkshake was stuck to the edge of my table.  And, later on, the first plate brought to Diane also had a quite visible small piece of hard food on it until the plate was replaced at my request.  Silverware was brought to the table, but our server quickly snatched a knife back and replaced it before the utensils were handed to me.  I hope the uncleanliness problem gets resolved soon, because this is a cool '50s diner with good food.  And, I would like to revisit it in the near future.

The cones of The Ultimate Tower that contained not very hot Chicken Bites, Chicken Wings, Fried Cheese, and Popcorn Shrimp had a base of Onion Rings at the bottom, which made it appear like there were more morsels of chicken and shrimp, and more hunks of cheese, than there really were.  And, the thin battered Onion Rings were really more like Onion Straws.

Overall, our experience was positive, and at 1:30 a.m. my mate and I left Roxy's and headed for home, full and happy.    * * * 1/2 stars!This review is for the Bar ONLY. We didn't eat.

This place makes me laugh a litle....decor that is, and the interesting characters we saw inside. Nothing WRONG with it, just kind of made me giggle and smile. Tehehehe.

We were attending a very fabulous, formal fancy shotgun wedding at the Little Chapel next door. We were early, the Chapel was running late. Shotgun weddings and booze go hand in hand so we stopped in at the HOJO and saw this Cafe. Perfect. It has a bar. 

The bartender was friendly and made us some wonderful drinks! Granted, they were only Captain 'n Cokes but hey, they were some MEAN Captain 'n Cokes and hit the spot. I thought maybe since it was inside the HOJO and close to downtown that the drinks would be cheap. Wrong. Try $7 each. Damn, steep for "nearly downtown" but I guess it's technically ON the strip...

If I'm ever in the area and need a quick drink I will definately stop in. Maybe even try some food next time.Let me preface this by saying the tacos here are good. They really are. I  don't think they are the best tacos ever, but are solid.  It seems to be be a bit pricey, e.g., $3 for one taco.

The portions are big and at least for the tacos, wrapped in two tortillas.  They also give you a lot of meat, so I usually order one taco and make two with the extra tortilla and meat.  My experience has been that the carne asada is the best, the chicken can be a little dry sometimes.   

The aguas frescas are a must.  My favorite is mango.  It takes just like ... mango!  In all seriousness, I think Los Tacos has the best agua frescas in town.  They actually taste like the fruit, instead of water with a hint of fruit flavor.Despite being an avid Thai fan, I have been to Komol (a Vegas Valley Thai favorite) twice. The first time was years ago, before I knew about its reputation. The experience was not bad, nor was it memorable. Since I have become savvy of its clout among locals, I ventured back there and - outside of the herbal salad - I was similarly underwhelmed. We had a sampling of four dishes and - the aforementioned glorious herbal salad excluded - nothing really stood out. It was all decent Thai food, but nothing more. And while it gets bonus points for that herbal salad, it certainly gets docked for the molasses service and (to a lesser extent) whatever it is that they call merlot in this joint (I know, what do I expect when ordering wine in a hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant). With Lotus of Siam in the same parking lot, I do not see myself coming back to Komol.

Side Note: I get hit up for change at a ridiculous clip in this parking lot when I visit Lotus. At Komol, I was able to park directly in front of the restaurant. Instantly I thought, "Well, at least I will not be hit up for change." Then, hilariously, I take two steps from my car and a dude asks if he can watch my car in exchange for some dough. It was like he appeared out of thin air! If mooching were a sport, the world championships would definitely be held in this parking lot.I had a Groupon for this place, and I guess I'm the last Las Vegan on earth to try the food here. I was working right next door, and I noticed that they had a steady flow of customers. Since I had never been here before, I took a little bit of time to make my menu selection. Tis' the season for turkey and stuffing, and this place had a seasonal sandwich to commemorate the venerable Thanksgiving meal. My sandwich "artist"  (Tom or Dan?) and the other employees really didn't seem all that enthused about their job. Thank goodness the lady behind me in line was my sandwich advocate, and she instructed him on how to make the sandwich correctly because he wasn't well-versed in the ingredients for each sandwich.

The turkey was processed lunch meat, and the amount of stuffing was pretty pathetic, so I requested a bit more. They were happy to oblige, but they placed it in the microwave to warm it up, and the stuffing ended up tasting like rubber. Seriously, I cringed a bit at the frequent use of the microwave. Ick!  I also purchased a chicken Caesar wrap, which did a fine job at underwhelming my palate as wel (thank goodness the lady behind me reminded Tom/Dan to put the romaine  lettuce and not the shredded iceberg he was planning on putting on my Caesar).

Their fresh veggies were quite limited, and to be honest with you, quite sad. I love a "sala-wich," and I always ask Subway to "run it through the garden when it comes to the veggies. Okay, so this isn't Subway, but it's a'ight. I'm not sure that I will come back though, because their prices are a lot higher than the $5 footlongs I've come to adore from their competitor, and the quality of the ingredients is lacking. Also, Capriotti's makes a better turkey and stuffing sandwich (the Bobbie), and theirs is year-round.

The staff was pleasant enough, and they were all quite prompt, but all 5 star ratings seem a little baffling to me. Meh!Solid Red Curry w/Tofu, got it at a 7 spice level (out of 10) and it was spicy enough without being overpowering. The Red Curry itself was on the thicker side and of medium sweetness. A little cheap on the Tofu and heavy on the Bamboo Shoots, though. Got it as part of the lunch special (7.95) which came with a spring roll, crab rangoon and a free cup of soup. The soup was a broken rice chicken soup - unfortunately it was very salty, and the spring roll was fresh but standard issue - nothing special. 

Enjoyed the Red Curry, but was most taken aback by the surprise +$3 charge for each Brown Rice substitution. Our bill showed up with two lunch specials and a +$6 charge for two Brown Rice substitutions. The Manager offered to remove one of the rice charges, which was reasonable, considering the waitress did not mention that there would be an upcharge. I do consider +$3 for a Brown Rice substitution a deal-breaker when it comes to lunch specials, especially when there are many similar Thai options at around $7-8, all-in. 

Dinner prices are $10-13 for the curries, and based on our experience today, expect to pay at least $3 for Brown Rice. If you happen to ask for a little more rice, I bet they ring you up for another $3 cup.

I would like to try their Massaman curry, as our waitress said it is her favorite.

The atmosphere IS impressive, warmly decorated and built entirely of wood: wood paneling, wood floors, and wood trim. The goldfish aquarium along the back wall is spotless, and the bathrooms are clean. They certainly take pride in their shop. I can see taking a client here or someone going on a date here, occasions when nickel-and-diming don't matter. 

Weera Thai is still my top-slot Thai place for value, taste, and service. Mad at myself for not taking advantage of double-punch-Mondays at Which Wich today instead (1 block north of Pin Kaow.)Like many others, I am a bread addict. Any great, aromatic bread, I can finish in a sitting and hate my life shortly after. What's a few thousand calories here and there? Thing is, Bon Breads does not make great aromatic bread. They make bread that looks really pretty, but doesn't live up to the promise. Let me explain. 

The appearance is that of a nice Italian or French piece, but darker. You expect a hard, crispy shell that flakes apart, but it's just super thick and actually pretty soft. Inside is a very dense dough with some air in it. The whole creation is quite heavy. It isn't bad, but something about it isn't awe-inspiring. It just doesn't live up to the promise of its looks. To me, a good artisan bread has the crispy and flaky light brown crust, it has the light and airy dough inside. It begs to be eaten. This just doesn't. It's just heavy bread made with [I'm sure] good ingredients and good intention.

Oh yeah, I didn't mention the other big one - $6 a loaf! Listen, not even the finest breads exceed $3-4. This is kind of an insult, but if you can get some bread on special - great! Otherwise, go to Patisserie Manon and get a hard shell baguette for way cheaper, and enjoy it more. I'm genuinely surprised people love this place so much.ok place if you are looking for stone veneer.

love their showroom, they have many different types and colors of stone so you really get a good visual on what to buy.

they also have quite a few choices in stock, although not everthing so if youre looking to meet a deadline i recommend going in ASAP just in case what you want needs to be special ordered.

the reason i docked the amount of stars was because of their customer service skills.
at first, everything was okay and the lady that assisted me was very pleasant.
we gave her the measurements of everything so she could estimate what we needed. she explained everything then we made our purchase.

in the end, we were short by FIVE corner peices. thats right, FIVE.
and we had 2 and a half small boxes of flats left over..

when we explained this to her, she said we would have to bring back a whole full box of flats to exchange it for an ENTIRE box of corners then pay the difference.

another $32 later, our project was complete and we had an almost full box of corners and a box and a half of flats remainding.

kind of irritating since we gave her exact measurements.
her estimate was way off and we had to come out of pocket with more money.

the second thing, was that the day before thanksgiving, they called asking when we were coming buy to pick up the stone we ordered.

at the time it was only 130pm and they did not close until 4. when that was pointed out to the lady that called she responded with 'well its a holiday and we want to get out of here.' 

ok, and?

nowhere posted does it say you were closing early thanksgiving eve.
soo, unless im mistaken, i have another 2 and a half hours before you are even supposed to lock your doors.

her response,
'yeah but its a holiday.'

seriously? are we three? whats happening?

ANYWAY.
my overall experience was not GREAT.
the only thing great about it was their selection of stone.
customer service could use some work.
and if you want holiday hours, then post them.

it cost about 3 grand for 220 sq. ft. of the stone we wanted..
not ridiculous but not the best price either.
the main reason theyre easy to deal with is because a lot of its in stock..We came here for breakfast.  I had a german pancake and my wife had an egg dish with hash browns (subbed for pancakes).  The german pancake was good.  I had the basic one served with butter, powdered sugar and lemon wedges.  It did have some burnt/crispy edges I removed before eating it.  Not sure if that's normal here but it doesn't look the best.  I would order the german pancake again but at full price, it is pretty expensive, almost $10 for one pancake.  We had a good coupon that made our meal a good value.  I would come back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so at full price.No complaints about food...delish! Ate way too much as usual. Nice selection in the dessert bar. The prime rib was very tender but too dry for my taste. I needed some kind of au jus to go with that but they didn't offer it. Oh well, price was good at $9.99 (they have a special going on).We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon after a fantastic wine tasting at Marche Bacchus.  We both enjoyed a glass of the super juicy Dr. Loosen Reisling and shared their Prosciutto Basil Pizza.  

Everything was very good, but the mark up was a bit high.  It was a super cute place with a nice vibe.  I understand they have half price bottles every Monday night.I was very impressed at the overall atmosphere and location, and give that 5 stars by itself.  However, the two filets and porterhouse were on the salty side and tasted more like cruise ship beef.  I was expecting better beef flavor, but I enjoyed it, unfortunately my party didn't.  The bread and house salad dressing were very good.This is one messy store, but wow: they have some cheap clothes and accessories! On my recent adventure, I found a high-low dress for $10 and a shirt for $5. But I think that my best deal from here had to be my 7 dollar sunglasses! They're hot! :) Besides summer is coming up and ya gotta protect your eyes! Though, when buying clothes, my suggestion is know your size and body really well because those fitting room lines tend to get kinda long! 

Of course, the quality of clothes is not that great, but hey, its cheap right?! But I have to say that the one good thing about this store is that it has a ton of selections. It almost makes you dizzy how overflowing with stuff this store is! 

Also, be weary of when they feel your clothes with metal sensors. They tend to forget taking them out! Happy shopping!!I've only been here a couple of times. In fact, I only come here when my cousin invites me to hang out with her and her boyfriend. It's kind of his home away from home. As such, they know pretty much everyone there. So by proxy, I know everyone there. It's got that Cheers quality.

My most recent visit was last Friday. We didn't play any pool. We just hung around the bar area celebrating a friend's promotion. The bar area is a bit awkward in that the seating is kind of weird. They have these booth type things that look like they once had tables.

A note about the bar - they only take cash. Their prices are decent - $3 for domestic beers in a bottle - and they have a pretty good selection. I found myself enjoying a bottle of Shock Top poured into a glass at the suggestion of Henry, the bartender. He poured most of it into the glass, then put the bottle on its side, and rolled it back and forth before pouring the rest into the glass. I had never heard of this before, but after a Google search, it's apparently legit.

"The beer is best enjoyed in a tall, wide-mouthed glass. To serve the brew perfectly, follow these pouring guidelines. Pour the brew down the side of the glass until about one-half inch of brew is left in the bottle. Lay the bottle on its side and roll it gently back and forth, mixing the remaining yeast that has settled at the bottom. Pour the rest of the brew, producing a nice, thick collar of foam."

NiceThe Range Steakhouse at Harrah's seems to be a hit or miss with some people.  For me, it was in between, but leaning towards a hit.  It was my last night in Vegas and I was craving a really good Ribeye steak.  I could've gone to other upscale steakhouses on the Strip like CUT, Craftsteak, or Delmonico's, but I wasn't in the mood to spend a whole lot of money and The Range was the more affordable option.  I managed to make a 9pm reservation here from Tix4Tonight and scored a voucher for 50% off my main entree, which made it even more afforable!

The place is pretty classy.  Nice panoramic view of Strip, dark mood lighting, and not very noisy.  However, right off the bat, my wine glass had a nice dirty ring around the rim.  Gross.  Definitely had that changed right away.

I ordered the 20oz Bone In Ribeye and a side of Creamed Spinach.  Why I ordered the Creamed Spinach, I had no idea because that 20oz Ribeye was a huge!!  Take a look for yourself (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=D282Ui_HVGY2GpjI2dwD_g).  What was disappointing though was that the Ribeye wasn't seasoned very well and didn't have any flavor.  I also ordered it medium rare, but it seemed very unbalanced to me with some sections cooked medium and some parts were downright rare, especially towards the bone.  My waiter didn't really give me much attention even though I was right in front of him.  I don' t recall him ever checking on me until the end of my meal so I didn't really have a chance to ask him to take my Ribeye back and cook it again.

Oh well, I was hoping for a better experience, but I guess you can't have everything when you're getting 50% off.  3.5 stars for being one of the more affordable steakhouses on the Strip.Location is everything. 

Located on my usual stumble home, Pizza Extreme is quickly becoming my 3 AM stop of choice.  Bring a couple of friends, randomly select 5 items (ranging from chicken drummies to pizza of decent quality), and head home to play some Tekken.  If you're a couple 7&7's into your night, you will not be disappointed.My first time at the Co-op, only AFTER I'd already moved away from Madison. For some reason, even with all the hype, I'd never really felt the desire to shop here.

It is quite a bit smaller than I expected, but it is packed with all of the organic/local produce, dried goods, prepared foods, and pastries that you could ever really want.

The products are in the same price range as Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, but the range of produce is neither as fresh nor as wide as Whole Foods'. On a cursory glance, I think you could probably get most of this stuff elsewhere for much cheaper. Yes, you'd probably have to be a little more careful about screening your produce. Yes, you'd probably have to look harder for the organic selection. But that is a lot of money saved.

I like that they carry a lot of cutesy accessories made by local businesses/artists though, and I had a dandy time perusing their collection of mason jars and mason jar accessories! (I bought myself a 'Cuppow' lid that I'd been eyeing for thheee longest time but had always thought was too expensive..it was 50 or 60 cents cheaper here than online! SO STOKED!)

Otherwise, I'm not a fan of the 5% non-member surcharge. I've been to plenty of other co-ops like this one that do just fine without having to charge their non-members. Meh. I'll just consider it my one-time fee for the 'Willy Street Co-op experience' cuz I probably won't be back.Food was decent and the service was fairly good as well. I got the lamb dinner and it was quite delicious. But my girlfriend's soup based meal was really subpar for $11. The house special dessert was pretty good. Overall, decent food but a little overpriced.Good.  Food a bit less spicy than Indian.  Definitely homemade with a lot of care.  I had their popular chicken dish, which was tasty, and the rice pudding desert, which was awesome.  Portions were well sized.  I felt healthier after eating here.  

Service was good, but not great.  Our server appeared to be very busy, but the place was less than half full.  Food came out within a reasonable time, and was piping hot.  The kitchen is in the back of the restaurant, so the food only had to travel about ten feet to the table.  

The only complaint I have is the price - I'm sorry, but this place is simply overpriced.  There were only four staff members there, all of them appeared to be family.  Food costs can't be that much.  I have issues with paying 15 bucks for a chicken leg, half a chicken breast, some rice, and a scoop of basic veggies.  It was all good, but 8 bucks would have been MUCH more appropriate.  As it was, my reasonably sized meal - the aforementioned chicken, rice and veggies; a side of bread; and the rice pudding totaled 21 dollars.  

In short - I would eat here again, but only if they dropped the prices to something reasonable.The portions were small and the prices were high.  I really didn't see a distiction between this type of food and any number of small indian places.I saw this ice cream shop as no-frills with some interesting flavors, but as soon as I was introduced to Paciugo I don't think I went back at all.It's true that Kabul isn't really memorable. But its kabobs are good. It feels like a restaurant on a college campus should ... like it's just managing to get by. It's good food.We tried to go back to the Italian restaurant across the street for another pizza but the wait was too long. Across the street we noticed a Korean 'joint'. Different but, it had that 'look' that could be magic, could be gross.  We poked our heads in and it was full of Asians.  A good sign so, in we went. This is solid Korean cuisine. We shared a pancake appetizer. I had a Tofu soup, the Spousal Unit had Beef Bulgogi. Both were quite tasty. Looking for Korean food in Madison? This will do it.Always a staple in Madison. Easy enough for quick and good lunch.

Nothing too fancy. Had the Cobb Burger on my last trip and have no complaints. 

Diverse menu that will let you try new things every time you go back.Short but helpful staff. And great new building in a great new shopping center. Lots of self-checkout and fabulous hours (until 9 on fridays!)God, it's so shockingly ugly inside here.  We both agreed it looked like a funeral parlor.  

The eggs were ok.Ask me to write a review a year ago, and I would have given this bar a fatty four stars, but the star-value for this establishment has declined in the past year which I will now explain:

The drink specials are decent--not spectacular, but they'll do.  Tuesday night is Beer and Bacon night.  It is definitely something I'd recommend.  What exactly is this:  $1 PBR and Coors Light and free bacon.  Let me tell you, there's pretty much no better combination than this.  For the most part, the bacon is delicious.  There have been a few times this year where the bacon has been very questionable.  And if that's the case, sit and enjoy cheap beer all night long.
Thursday night is the special on fishbowls.  Ahhh fishbowls.  The many memories or lack there of because of them.  Even when they're not on special they're always a good choice.  $15-20 for a delicious bowl of alcohol.  I'm in.  Not to mention the array of colors you can choose from.  My favorite being the teal or purple.  Share them between a bunch of people, and you've got yourself a good drunken night.  Most likely full of poor life choices.  Maybe that's just me?  Damnit.
Monday nights they have karaoke.  Anybody who knows me knows I love to belt out a tune or two.  It's very entertaining to observe if you're not up to participating in the science that is karaoke.

With all this positive comes the negative.  The crowd Wandos attracts.  Douchebag central during the school year.  And on top of being douchebags, most of the time they are extremely hammered douchebags.  Nothing good comes from that.  Nothing.  The employees are okay.  Some are awesome.  Some are the antithesis of awesome.  Most of those being the football players that are hired as bouncers.  Sure, I get why they're hired--they are big tall and scary.  But with them comes their dbag athlete friends.  And with atheletes comes the jersey chasers.  Lame!  That's all I'm saying about all of that.

All in all, definitely check out Wandos.  Hell, it used to be my favorite bar.  Who knows, maybe you'll like it.  If anything, you're sure to get drunk!I only had the wonton soup.  There were 3-4 wontons with tiny pinkie finger size droplets of beef inside.  The soup tasted like a beef stock.  It was tasty, but pretty generic.  But that's what wonton soup is!The Good Egg is like a Coldplay record: totally inoffensive, totally safe.  The menu is varied enough that you're bound to find something you'll stick in your mouth and forget about later.  Also, the service is utterly competent.  In the same way you're not motivated to turn the radio either off or up while Chris Martin croons through "Talk," you won't feel a need to savor or spit out your Southwest Scramble.  It's just there.  Nobody hates Coldplay and nobody hates The Good Egg.

Except I do actually hate Coldplay, mostly for the reasons listed above.  I do not, however, hate The Good Egg.  Maybe I hold breakfast restaurants to a different standard than rock bands, unfair as it may seem. 

 I do realize that the comparison I'm drawing is a stretch, but it's 3:20am and breakfast will soon be upon us.  If I had to go somewhere, I'd probably go here.  It's close enough to my apartment and I know I won't be mad about my meal for the rest of the day.Great location, good beer and liquor selections, prices on the higher side, mixed service, lame food.  I've met up with friends downtown at this location several times.  The Irish in me is drawn to these watering holes faster than an Arizona Republican is drawn to a pro-S.B.1070 rally.  I want to like this place more than I do...  Maybe it's the higher prices and lack of any sort of happy hour that provides good deals.  Maybe it's the fact that the rubin I ordered looked like one of those sandwiches mom packed in my lunch box stuffed in a ziplock bag back in 3rd grade - and didn't seem to taste much better...  Or maybe it's just the fact that with all of the other great places there are to eat and drink downtown, Seamus didn't get the memo.  Bottom line, stop in for a beer if you're in the area but look elsewhere for deals and good food.Had lunch here yesterday with my husbands mom and sister. we started with bloody Mary's and they were super yummy I would come back for those alone. ordered the bruchetta for starters and it was OK, a little steep in price $12 for 4 pieces, they are big slices of bread but big being WAY to thick, we chose 4 different kinds and I liked one and the other two were ehhh. we all ordered different items so we could share and taste. I got the brie salad and it was pretty good the raspberry dressing made it, every now and then I ate a piece of lettuce that tasted like dirt but all in all it was good. sister in law got the Ruben and man was that pastrami thick, I think the slicing made it tuff and chewy. mom in law got the soup sandwich combo , mushroom brie soup was super yummy but her chicken cordon blue was nasty the chicken had that weird been reheated in the microwave taste yuck I ate one bite and that was it. service was good,  place was super cute, prices were a little steep for what you get.   It was a 30 min drive for me so not sure if I will go back.Food was very good but WOW this place is LOUD when it is busy.  Concrete walls reflect all of the sound and gave me a headache.  Never had this happen at a restaurant before.Kristin S. and I went to Portland's this past Saturday night to check out their $30 four course prix fixe menu that they are advertising. After reading the menu online, I was excited...my excitement lasted until we got there and sat down.

The prix menu had changed slightly from the one online and the fish entree I wanted had been replaced with duck which I don't eat. So no prix fixe menu for me. Kristin and I split the crab cake and scallops appetizers. The scallops were delicious and the best part of our dinner that night. The crab was crispy breading and was fried (strike 1), was totally lacking in the crab meat department (strike 2), and had wayyyyy too much filler (strike 3). Not good at all. For dinner I had the white pizza which was OK...the cheese was too heavy and when I picked my first slice up the heaviness of the cheese caused all of it to fall straight off onto the plate. I actually think the slices I reheated the next day for lunch at work were better than when I got it fresh at Portland's on Saturday.  We split a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc that was good. Our bill (without tip) was $72 which included the bottle of wine, 2 appetizers, and 2 entrees. Thankfully it wasn't more than that because I don't think the food would have been worth the price.

Our waitress was very nice and service through the evening was fine. For a Saturday evening around 7 pm, it wasn't very crowded at all. I didn't get an overly inviting feel when we walked in especially since it took almost five minutes for someone to appear to seat us. It seems to lack atmosphere and with other better wine bars in the area, I won't be running back.First time I have gone to Bill Johnson's in years.  It's right down the road but I never seem to think of going there until the other night.  It was A ok.  It's not that exciting but the food was good and the place is cute in all it's retro western glory.  I might go back again.I have now been to Bikini 4 times, which is enough to get the full experience and discover what Bikini really has to offer. What is it that Bikini has to offer, you ask? 

The wonderful stench of urine. 
Ear piercingly loud and horrible music. 
Miserable bartenders. 
The inability to use credit cards which goes against all that is rational. 
People desperately trying to be cool. 

So, I don't really like it here, but at the same time, I have no problem going here. I guess you would call that indifference and Indifference is the essence of inhumanity.this place is a total hole in the wall, but I like it. the drinks are cheap and not many people hang here, that's what I like about it. I'm not much of a people person, but I do like to go out and I can sit at a booth or the bar and not be bothered by a crowd.Well this place has been here for as long as I can remember. At least 20 years.
They used to be wonderful! One of the best places to go.
 But, they sold and changed staff but, kept the name. I do not know why.
Anyway, it went down hill very quickly. The new owners did not seem to get the concept of why this place was so popular.
They do close for an entire month in the summer while the family goes back to Thai Land for holiday.
 They were so bad for awhile I vowed never to go back.
But since my girl lives over in that part of town I would cave and we would go.
It is just like a lot of the other patrons have written. It is so hit and miss. 
One day the food is great and the next time you go it is horrible.
 The lunch specials are good. But the last 4 times I have gone they never have the soup. Do not advertise soup if you really do not have it.
 Parking is tight so sometimes you have to park on the street.Yeah... I think Frybread house relocated, and is now replaced by "Two Hippies Magical Mushroom Burger"...correct me if I'm wrong. Anyway, this is about the frybread, not the burger.

Last time I visited this place, I had the frybread, opted with steak instead of shredded beef, with everything on it- cheese, carmelized onions, guacamole, and all the other stuff that makes for a good artery-clogging lunch. And were my arteries clogged indeed! The frybread I ordered was good, especially when I sank my teeth into the stuffed mess, could feel the grease stream down my mouth and chin. My table etiquette was totally abandoned here, but if you could care less about the calories and like grease glossed lips, come here. It's okay.If I say it wasn't as bad as I was expecting is that good?  2.5 stars.

I have only eaten at a JB's once.  That was in Price, UT probably 3 or 4 years ago.  It was memorably bad.  So when I offered to pick up lunch for an employee and they picked this place I was expecting the worst.  I went in with diminished expectations.

I played it safe with a BLT, fries and a shake.  It was OK!  Yay!  The BLT was actually almost....well...pretty good.  Hey that wasn't as bad as I thought it would be!For now, Crazy Jim's gets 3 stars. That's a fair, middle of the road rating for a decent restaurant. Apparently, I didn't realize it was a Greek restaurant, so what do I do? I order a Ham and Pineapple calzone. It wasn't the best I've had but it was still pretty good. My lunch companion ordered a gyro with a side of pasta salad, and I have to say that it looked better than my meal and cost about three dollars less. I tried the salad and the abundance of feta made it taste great. 

Other menu items include subs, pasta and salads (with or without lettuce. All the breads and crusts are made fresh daily on site.

My only complaints with this restaurant are that it's very, very small. So small that I noticed a table pushed entirely into the back corner so that only two chairs on the exposed sides could be seated at it. Also, I was quite literally back to back with the gentleman dining at the table behind me. It was also fairly busy (which speaks well for them and their business) and difficult to hear what my friend was attempting to tell me. Oh well, I doubt it was very important anyway...

If I go back to sample the Greek fare, I may be tempted to add a star but until then, this rating is based primarily on my choice of entree.Last year I would've given this place 5 stars.  I really like this place. Their food is really good, especially the crazy calamari salad.  But my hub and I went there for lunch yesterday and both of us noticed the change in portions.  Back in the day we could only order an appetizer and a crazy salad.  The portions were big enough we could share and be perfectly fed without being too full.  So yesterday we began our lunch with our normal ordering style and when the food came we realized the portions were so much smaller that we had to order more food.  We also noticed the plates and serving platters were smaller.  Clearly Crazy Jim has decided to deal with the crappy economy by giving patrons less food and charging the same price.  The food was still very tastey.  The service was still fair (never been great).   But as the ecomomy is hitting us too, we decided Crazy Jim's has now been moved from the "Awesome Crazy Deal" category, to the "Maybe if I have a craving"  category.     
Bummer.I like their salsa spread and love the tamales. The only issue that I have with Carmba's is that the food if you ask me is a little pricey for a fast casual Mexican restaurant. The price is very similar to a full service restaurant so am a little disappointed. Otherwise the food is great and most of the folks that work here are very friendly.The food is usually good, especially pancakes and omelets. It's usually busy, the booths are not that comfortable, but the service is friendly and it's a cozy place. I come here about once a month.My daughter only gave it two stars I  will give it a more generous three. Last night I had a hankering for Japanese food , I was tired yet wanted something we hadn't tried before. So we ended up at Bamboo, which we have passed literally a million times and never gone in.  I was thinking what if this is a little gem and it's been here the whole time. 

The service was fast and not bad , waitresses were very attentive and thoughtful.  But the food just didn't match any of our wishes. I was also distracted by large carpet stains on a dark rug , you have got to really make a mess to stain that bad. So get it clean up people ( Can I recommended EPIC carpet cleaning ?)  The best part of the meal was the miso soup which was pleasant and had mushroom, tofu and chives  nice taste from there it just was as Bri said meh. I picked up a piece of Ginger at one point  and said this it the tastiest part of the meal .. aren't I funny?  I ordered Tempura cuz I have wanted  to  find tempura for my mom  but this just tasted like onion ring batter on all the veggies and very greasy like an onion ring . Great if you are PMSsy and want  fried veggies.. than it would be perfect.  
The sushi we ordered was unremarkable , a mediocre caterpillar roll with brown avocado ,  a Las Vegas roll  that just tasted blah  and something else I cant remember .   
I would only eat here if people threatened we were going to Olive Garden or this place , I 'd take this place.Went to Denny's after attending a meeting, There was 12 people in our party. So why am I reviewing Denny's? We all know what Denny's is about. Well when you're with friends, this is definitely a great place to go!  Food is good and satisfying. With Denny's people always seem to have a love-it or hate-it opinion of the chain.

Tonight for our party of 12 we had our drinks were delivered in a reasonable amount of time given the amount of people in our party and my food was ordered and delivered in about 15-20 minutes with the exception of one order that got delivered after most of us had eaten. On a good note the manager comp'd that meal which was nice if her to do.

We all had requested separate checks and there was no problem making that request. I would like to give our waitress a lot of recognition for working with our large party.

Nothing special about this Denny's.... I have no complaints and the food was brought quick enough and the order was right so it's all good.

FOOD: The food was hot and fresh out of the kitchen, it wasn't cold when it got to me, which made me happy.  The quality of the food was decent too.  There's not much to say about this place though, because the menus are all the same at all Denny's.  The point being: a Denny's is a Denny's is a Denny's, but some are better than others. This one is decent.  PRICE: Very reasonable. SERVICE:   Excellent.  AMBIANCE:  Typical Denny's. CONCLUSION:  We were seated immediately. Food was decent, everything that should have been hot was. Service was great. RETURN  FACTOR: 100%Water:
It might sound silly but water is very important to me - if a restaurant can't serve good water how can anything taste good?!

The water was good!

Off to a bad start:

BBQ Pork Slices Appetizer
BBQ Rib Appetizer
And
Sizzling Rice Soup

All very bland with very little flavor...

Egg Rolls - Excellent!

Crab Puffs are good too...

I didn't try any but my family said the egg foo young was very good!

Orange Beef was good as well - a tad too sweet for me - but I would eat it again.

My family also really liked Moo Shu Beef

I really liked the Orange Chicken!

The Crispy Beef Pan Fried Noodles were good but really needed to be crunchier.

The Lemon Chicken is AMAZING!!

 Prices are ok the place is clean...

We would come back....

Overall review is a decent place nothing special but you won't be unhappy you came... If you have a few of the better dishes - it just might make you smile :)Always have a good time when we go here, gets freakin' busy during Happy Hours! HUGE selection of TV's! sooo many you dont know what to watch!Not crowded and well maintained with very few machines in need of service. Good amount of machine to spread the workout, but a bare bones staff during the day. I walked in and no one said hi, walked out and no one said bye. The hospitality lacks but overall it's a gym I will be returning to since the one close by shut down.Solid thanks!If you go here when its busy it's usually a bit under staffed. The sushi here is average but they do put there own twist on it. They add a little liquid smoke to all of there sushi sauces which adds a little variety. The first time I went here was about a year and a half ago and I wasn't to impressed with the sushi. My friend went back a month after that and they had gotten rid of sushi all together. Just recently they started serving sushi again so I decided to go back and try it and it was fantastic. Flavors are very different from most other sushi joint but I enjoyed it. They do a 19.95 all you can eat sushi.The son and I tried Elmer's last night for the first time.  Figured he could see what the place is about so he knows where he can dash to for lunch from CHS.

He got the Asada burrito which he said tasted good.   I got the green beef hot burrito.  It was tasty, but very messy.  I had to grab a fork and knife to finish.

They have a pretty decent sized menu.  Prices are dirt cheap.   Hands down they beat Guedo's because they offer chips and salsa and take debit cards.  Food, prices and counter help is better at Elmer's too.

Not the cleanest of places.  Definite hole in the wall.  The smooshed food on the floor by our table kinda got to me.This was my third time at this The Good Egg. It is a nice place with friendly staff and no wait. The food is good and I like the fact that they give you some guidance on calorie count per meal.  With this place being so close to home, it sure beats the McDonald's across the street.I might even go 3.25 stars here. Tried these guys last night for the first time. They had a big banner out that proclaimed "Any 12" Pizza $12." 

When I order pizza I want either; 

a. A tasty pie NY style. The closest I've found in the valley have been Grimaldi's and Mama Mia. Thin crust, minimal toppings, yum. 
b. A "regular" pizza with lots of toppings. I've been accused of having a salad bar on my pizza. This gets expensive so the offer advertised on the banner was promising. 

So I dropped in and ordered one to go with 3 toppings. Not bad. Medium body crust, mild sauce, not too tart or sweet. Plentiful toppings, cheese nicely browned. Tasty. 

I was disappointed when I realized they are a chain and I immediately had fears of a Peter Piper or Little Ceasar's type of pizza but this was distinctly better.Orange Table has great food for both breakfast and lunch, but it is a pain to go there because it takes forrrrrrrrrrrrever.  If you go on a Sunday, forget it.  On Sundays they serve the breakfast menu until 3 pm (no ordering off the lunch menu until then), and both times I went on a Sunday I was there for at least 2 hours.  I once went with a big group of 7 of us and we were there from about 11 until 2!!  Soooo ridiculous.  It's not only Sundays that are bad though- the service is always slow.  And they have also messed up my order twice out of about 4 or 5 times I've been there.  The staff is very friendly though- just slow and spacy.  Or maybe it's the kitchen.  Who knows.
On the positive side, the food really is good!  The chicken salad is great and they have a purple grilled cheese sandwich with grilled tomatoes that is awesome.  All their sandwiches are really good- I definitely recommend it for a good takeout sandwich.  I've also had the chipotle chicken melt which is really cheesy and good.  Their Bloody Marys deserve five stars- one of the best!!  And they have some fun cocktails.
It's a little hard to find if you aren't familiar with the Civic Center since it is tucked away- they have a nice patio and they allow dogs on it.  I recommend it for takeout if you are getting lunch or if you are in a good mood for breakfast and don't mind a leisurely time!This place is good, but it's nothing special. The last time I was there it took about 30+ minutes to get our food which was pretty frustrating considering we had to be back at work soon. The set up is a little strange between the back dining room, the to go spot and the side patio. I think it's a little overpriced for what you get. Chicken kabobs are good, so is the vegetarian platter.A historical Scottsdale treasure and definitely one of its most unique restaurants. From the front door donkey to the blue-tinted aquarium area to the Diego Rivera replicated art in the old Mexican adobe main dining room, it is a neat place to eat.  However, if you are looking for great Mexican food in Arizona, it would not be my first choice. The service is fast and friendly and I love the mariachi band and occasional live music however the food is less than desirable. My favorite meal is the Pollo a La Queso Crema but sometimes the chicken is dry and the rice and beans are crusty from sitting too long on a hot plate. There is a definite difference in quality when the restaurant is busy, so timing can be everything. It's a great spot to get a margarita after a Giants Spring Training game but for a good meal, it's just okay.We really need a 3.5 star rating, but since there isn't, we are going to round down since it's on the weak 3.5 side.  All that aside, the food is decent for Mexican standards.

They have a legit chili con queso (especially the one with chorizo too).  Think creamy velvetta cheese with chilis chopped up in there.  It is pure cheese heaven.

The food doesn't blow you away, but you can find some servicable choices that you will be satisfied with.  There is a shrimp in garlic sauce that is served with a guacamole salad that is really good.  You can enjoy some good guacamole with chips and finish off the rest with the salad.Walk by this bar and it's screaming for you to come inside. It's mainly the patrons, the loud music and sports on the TVs, but the loudness and energy will reel you in. 

They have a nice assortment of beers on tap. I even tried a local beer. Bartenders were cool. It's definitely a locals joint - but they're welcoming to outsiders.I gave Ra a 3-star rating because of the food but the atmosphere is very entertaining.  The sushi is not great unless your really hungry and have been drinking a bit. A lot of people who go to Ra anyway are usually hipsters and sushi newbe's who only try the California roll, Vegas roll or anything that is aesthetically appealing. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy hanging out with friends, drinking and having a good time at Ra but I solely do not go there for the sushi.

For an entertaining time and drinks: go to RA. 

For good sushi: look elsewhereThe Grapevine is one of those places that you always randomly walk by and think "I've got to try this place out," but because of it's obscure, off-the-beaten-path location it's easy to forget.  

I think one of the best parts about the Grapevine is the diverse realm of fun you can have.  Whether it's some day-drinking up on the patio for Spring Training, some racious karaoke with a distinctly more...experienced...crowd, or grabbing some pizza in a dimly lit dining area, The Grapevine is definitely not a bad place to stop.

It's been a while since I've had the food here, but from what I remember it was pretty tastey and equally reasonable in terms of price.  Drinks are a little on the expensive side, but hey - that's Old Town!This is my favorite Pei Wei. It is always clean and never too crowded. They also have a fantastic covered patio. I like the Mongolian beef or chicken and the Dan Dan noodles and my husband likes pretty much everything he tries here. They used to have a beef ramen bowl that was to die for but I guess it was only offered for a limited time. The food can be salty at times but I always enjoy it.I've been here a few times, had some pretty mixed experiences. It seems pretty normal that if you get 4 items, two of them will be pretty good and the other two will kinda suck. I haven't experienced any items with an overtly bad odor, but sometimes I'll get a piece of fish with a 'this should've been served yesterday' texture. The pricing and usually the service are pretty good.

Also, there is a full bar here with happy hour and reverse happy hour and signs all over the place for their pitcher special and I'm not really sure why 4 people previously entered that this place serves no alcohol. There's plenty available if you need it.

By the way, just an observation from my latest visit, if I pay a $14.00 tab with a $20 bill, does it really need to be said that I will not be able to leave a decent 15-25ish% tip if my change includes a $1 bill and a $5 bill?We ordered delivery. It came pretty fast which was nice.


My sub seriously was really disappointing. The description on the menu made it sound delicious. A veggie sub with avocado and lettuce. Mmmmm~

Well it was smothered in mayo. I asked for light mayo. Okay I can get past that. Basically what I got was mayo bread with cheese and a buttload of iceberg lettuce. The avocado I had been wanting so badly was in a paste form. I seriously felt like I was eating babyfood. I told my friend, "THIS ISNT A VEGGIE SUB. ITS A LAZY SUB!"

But my brother and dad said their subs rocked and the delivery was quick and prices were okay. The bread was really good too. I just uh...yeah won't be getting that veggie disaster again.I guess I would call this tex-mex ish.. I ordered the blackened catfish tacos.. they were excellente.. They also serve some cornbread with your meal that is wonderful.. Our waiter was super nice, and cute.. 

I went for lunch so it wasn't crowded at all and we didn't have to wait.I came this time to try the happy hour for the first time.  Wasn't as good as I expected and drinks were more than you would normally pay at happy hour but they were premium or top shelf like cabo wabo etc and the two drinks I had were so good that they kind of made up for the high price.   I expected the food to be way better but got the trio and the guac was tasteless had to put lots of salt on it and salsa but the queso that came with it was really good the salsa was just ok.  Steak tacos were pretty good I would get those again.  The shrimp guacamole bites were not that great.  The shrimp on top tasted really good by itself but they put too much of the tasteless guacamole on top of the cracker then top it with the shrimp and that way they are too big to handle in a bite and the boring guac is no fun and seems to take away from the good taste of the shrimp. Total cost for 3 appetizers and 4 drinks $65 without tip.  Next time I would rather go to the Keg House for less and better food too.not worth the money drinks are very small with a high cost, since when do serve margarita's in a rock glass bartending 101Food is good and cheap but they overkill the taste of their special platters. Sometimes simple food is a good and healthy choice. I prefer their wrap instead of other stuff in the menu.Sun Splash is kind of fun, with a reasonably long slow and winding "river" to tube in, some slides including an especially fun plunge.A fun place to go with very friendly staff. Definitely attracts an alternative crowd!Oregano's is a good stand-by but I, having been to this and other locations many times, believe it is over-rated.  The food is a little better than your average place with large portions.  However, the place is crowded and loud and the wait for both seating and food/drink is often long.  This would be okay if the food was out of this world.  It's good, but not out of this world.we called 7 minutes before they closed and was just going to get food elsewhere but they took our order anyways. thats reason to order from them again right there! we got a pizza and mushroom pizza and a ham and pineapple. both were pretty good. still warm when we got it. not bad for pizza at 11 at night.Friendly wait staff.  Authentic ingredients.  However the shawarma are nothing like I had in Kuwait.  The shish kabob is worth getting.   Basmati rice needs some work.   The market next door is great.We hit this place after being at Dos Gringos the night before and it was not of the same caliber.  We were one of only a few people in the place, so it is hard to say if it is a cool hang out place.My oh my, I expected sooo much better out of you...

Spent last saturday night at Cafe Boa and was extremely underwhelmed. Bruschetta was not on par with the price tag associated with the dish. Waited upwards of 45 minutes for my food. My spicy dish pasta was quite tasty but again, nowhere near what I paid for the above-AVERAGE entree. Hoping to at least salvage my dinner night, I ordered the cabernet at the recommendation of our waitress and again, not on par for what I would expect for the amount of money I dished out for the entire meal. 

Positives included the overall atmosphere, interior decor and waitresses/servers. This feels like a spot that might be a little bit more succesfull if they offered legit Happy Hour or Weekday specials.. It might take some of the sting out of spending 9$ for a dryyyyyy cabernet, 16$ for a so-so pasta, etc.from May 20, 2010 -- or those of you who love the mediocre food and service of Caffe Boa Ahwatukee (no relation), don't go to the Tempe big sister. Tempe's Caffe Boa, headed by Chef Payton Curry, is sleek, friendly and a foodie's dream. The new spring/summer menu, just launched, shows the kitchen's skill. homemade charcuterie, good cheese selection, a tasty burger and inventive panini. the crown to the whole menu? the new gnocchi dish...homemade, soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside sauteed in browned butter and sage, served with preserved lemon, grilled favas and a fried egg on top. died and gone to heaven. service is relaxed but not slow and cordial. so happy we tempeans now have an outstanding fresh, seasonal, local gem in our neck of the woods. why travel further? 

update: Payton no longer there...restaurant has gone back to old menu. haven't had the opportunity to try it again, but friend just went there last night and didn't seem to have many complaints. it is a higher end, food centric restaurant that Tempe needs more of.Warning: when you tell your friend to meet you at Thai Basil -- always always be sure to coordinate to the correct Thai Basil!

Why!? Because there are so many Thai Basils in the valley it can be confusing.  Fortunately, this one is close by 2 other ones so I wasn't too off!

Seriously someone needs to change their name and differentiate themselves.  No alcoholic beverages at this location, so no Phuket beer for you!  I wonder how they make the drunken noodles here. Wink!  Not to worry still got pretty good food here.  I think Thai Basil is starting to become the McDonalds of Thai food. I ordered me a Mc-Pad See-Ew with chicken; no super-size for me.  If you need a quick Thai fix this will do the job.  However, if you wish to be wowed and powed; I suggest moving on.  My friend ordered the tofu fried rice and she really enjoyed it so I guess it could be a hit or miss, but still I'm the one reviewing haha!    

Service was good and the ambience -- well pretty simple Thai decor.  No Panangburgler? - Enjoy!This place was aight,

$4 Beer specials were a pretty good deal but the sole reason I'm not rating this place any higher is because of the food. (Better options at 4Peaks and Santan)

It was Underwhelming and Overpriced~ The ambiance of this place was nice though

Had the Oyster Po Boy and well.... if you want seafood I guess one should move a bit closer to the W-Coast.So I rolled in about 5:30 to meet family for dinner.  The wife and daughter were already there, sitting in the reception area - apparently they could not be seated because my daughter had a cup of iced coffee from one of those coffee places.  She said they told her she could not be bringing in outside "food".  Ok, I get it.  But really?  a coffee drink?  This is a bit petty if you asked me.  Geez.  A good restauranteur would offer to transfer the drink to one of their own glasses so she could still enjoy it.  You know, this review could have been four stars, but for this, I'm taking one off.  I can understand if she brought in a whole meal from Taco Time or something, but a coffee drink?  Can you say ubiquitous?

Ok, rant over.  She ended up tossing her drink so we could be seated.  Our table was ready, and chips and salsa were quickly delivered, shortly after the waittress came by to take our drink order.  The rest of our party had not arrived, but it was not a problem for them.  Kudos on this.  

The salsa was chunky and mild, good flavored, but a hotter option from a restaurant named "Serranos" would be appropriate.  Along with the salsa came a bowl of bland bean dip - I dunno, maybe some cheese or red sauce mixed in to liven it up?  Eventually, the remainder of our party filtered in, and the waittress was very gracious in giving us time to get acclimated and figure out what we wanted to order.  I had a shredded Pork Chimi enchalada style with the same tasteless beans.  it also came with rice, but I don't eat Mexican rice, so I cannot comment on that, other than it was all mixed in with my beans.  I'm not a divider-plate kinda guy, and the beans really weren't worth saving, so it wasn't a big deal.  

The chimi came with a delicious chunky guacamole and "seasoned" sour cream.  I think they just added some white pepper to the sour cream.  It was ok.  The chimi was big and crispy, but the pork filling was dry and had little flavor beyond pork.  The combination of the green sauce, guacamole and sour cream saved it.  The wife had a relleno, as did the MIL, the MIL complained that the rellano should have been crispy but was drowning in sauce, and so lost much of it's appeal.  The wife had no comment.  Others seemed to be ok with their dishes, although nobody really raved.  Overall, this is not a place I would make a special trip to visit, and I might be inclined to suggest a different place in the area, like maybe Top Shelf, but the food was ok and the prices were not bad.  Dinner for eight came in around $130 with tip.1st review here...  3 stars means "a-ok" and that what this place is.

Nothing fancy but at least the bar is clean and the wait staff is attentive.  If your looking for a local sports bar, this is the best with in walking distance of  mill/baseline.  

Lots of TVs in viewing range of most of the seats.  However, this place is lacking in the HD department.  Lots of older, fading, rear projection models do not make up for a few well placed HD panels IMO.  Good variety of channels showing.  They did not have the MLB package and its June so... not much else to watch.

Food was ok, maybe even a-ok.  The best appetizer has to be the fried mac n cheese bites.  Quesadillas not great, but after a few drinks they sure hit the spot.

Shuffle board and golden tee live available.Stopped in here for lunch today, joined by Scott W. & Mike C.  Let's get the not-so-good out of the way first:

This ok but ordinary sit-down restaurant is expensive!  While they have small lunch specials for $7.25 (2 small entree items & one side), a regular combo meal costs $11.50, even at lunch time!  Regarding the food, they serve thin chips, & I like them the thicker the better.

Ok, the good:  The chips came with serving containers of both chunky mild & pureed hot salsa that you can mix together for yourself into a little bowl they give each person, if you like.  That was nice.  Also, I appreciated the pitcher of ice water, & you can just pour yourself some more without any fanfare.

My #1 Combo included a shredded beef taco, a shredded beef tamale, & a cheese enchilada, plus rice & refried beans.  Everything was good, especially the enchilada, & the portions generous.  You don't leave hungry from this place!     :-)Good pancakes. Eggs and breakfast burrito I would say are just ok. Not sure why all the rave reviews.It's called the Hideaway for some very good reasons....do not piss off the locals or the non- want to be locals for that matter, they will kill you, eat you children, and bugger  you in the most heinous ways if you ever insult their bar, bike, or women.
That being said, you could not meet a nicer bunch or people, in all the times I've been there, I have never witnessed a fight, a stolen (worst sin ever) bike, wallet, or witnessed a fight.
Truly great people, awesome, fun and hot female staff, (had to throw that in) and cheap specials/ happy hoursGood food, service a little slow, a little dated and you do have to put up with a lot of whiney elderly clientele who send the waiter back for a lot of petty trivial stuff that takes away from handling other customers,  more like babysitting seniors.I am not a huge Starbucks coffee fan (too bitter for my taste) but I can not deny that I thoroughly enjoy a Venti White Chocolate Iced with 2 extra shots and whipped cream on a hot day.

When I'm feeling especially indulgent I'll spring for the Coffee Frapacino.  The heck with the calories!

The staff is always warm and friendly with big smiles and a ready welcome.  I get a kick out of listening to the booming barritone voice of the barista.  Don't know his name, but he is young and his voice and personality are that of a much larger guy.  Personality plus.

Usually fast, usually accurate.  When they make a boo boo on a drink they give it to ya for free.  Can't knock that kind of service.

I love the whole ambience in these coffee houses even if I'm not "in love" with their "straight" coffee.My wife and I frequent this place quite a bit. We enjoy it, we know what we are getting into when we go here, good prices for good portions of good food. 

Nothing lights out, but filling and, for the most part, authentic. 

The location is a little weak, you have to really want to go to Top Shelf to go to Top Shelf, as it is tucked just deeply enough into the NW Peoria Suburbs that its almost not worth it. 

I really enjoy the chicken burrito fundido. I'm just saying.Delicious smoothies!! Yummy!! 
I have tríed both honeydew and the coconut smoothies!! I Will be trying the yellow curry chicken today.This place is not bad. They are constantly doing construction and remodeling which is inconvenient. There are not a lot of restaurants, but who wants to eat at the airport any way. They do have long lines if you are coming or leaving any time there is a large convention. I think their largest conventions are in the beginning of Jan. I believe it's during the first week or so where they get more than 100,000 people in town. There are slot machines so that is fun for me. The place is huge so it will be a walk no matter where you are going. Also parking is ridiculously expensive.Never been to Terminal 1 since Hawaiian flies out of Terminal 2, but I've come to know Terminal 2 like the back of my hand. Love that there is a Burger King and Pizza Hut to grab something to eat while waiting to board. Can't say that you can never win at the slot machines in the airport since our friend won $300 off the poker machines. The TSA agents at the security check in are rude but the Hawaiian Airlines people are great!Fly in and out of Vegas here every time. Not that exciting of an airport, but it doesn't really need to be when you have one of the most exciting cities right outside your doors. 

The cab rides are super expensive, so that sucks.Hello Las Vegas!!! They need more restaurants in the B terminal...I feel ike this airport has definitely improved overtime.  However there are still some things lacking.  The restaurants need some major revamping.  One thing I LOVE about Vegas is the amazing selection of high end cuisine.  The airport doesn't have much and what they have isn't really great.  I do like how there are slot machines to keep me entertained if my flight is delayed or if I'm only stopping for a layover.Well, "Viva Las Vegas!"

This seems to be a hub for Virgin America. Interesting, interesting.

That's about it.its convenient being downtown but the pharmacy itself literally closes at 5pm everyday and the prices are at least $2-3 more than a regular walgreens that you would find elsewhere.GREAT overhaul of the decor. The rooms and the pool were really nice.  The bed was super comfortable.  But the service in the cafe was abysmal!  Not just once, but all three times I ate there.  Absolutely ridiculous.  And so out of character with everything else.  We ate at the tepanyaki spot, and it was awesome.  I will be staying here again.  Downtown is a lot of fun.  But I seriously doubt I will dine in the cafe again.  I'd rather step outside and brave the crowd of 3:00 am zombies to look for snacks at Walgreens.This Petco is hit and miss and can be frustrating when you stop for a specific product and they are out of it just like today. I also informed an employee in the aquatic department about two fish that I bought here at different times that both died after a short time. I have a lot of fish and only the fish I have purchased from this store have died! 

I will just continue to by my maintenance items needed for our 75 gallon Aquarium however will not purchase fish ever again from this store.

The staff is friendly and the store is clean and the location is close to my home so I will continue to shop here for convenience reasons. 

I also like that their exchange and return policy is lax because they guarantee product purchases. I have bought things for my Aquarium that did not work and they will refund or exchange with no questions asked.I will recommend this to anyone who wants a familiar taste and a break from big portioned Las Vegas food and buffet...They have the IMAX theatre. That, plus the closest proximity from my place is the reason we frequent here. Also Palms Casino has a decent food court including Earl of Sandwich, so wait time doesn't suck - we don't have to eat the crappy hot dogs inside. Enough reasons to settle.Was here for quick lunch as we didn't feel like the buffet or the chinese fast food at the Rio. Overall, was better than I expected. Lunch specials come with a variety of curries, tandori, and naan bread. If you are into Indian food, you won't be disappointed. Only thing is they don't offer cheese Naan, or garlic Naan........We went on Thursday night for the NHL awards that was at the Palms. Very elegant place. It's a more stuffy, but classy place instead of hip and trendy. The view is great like everyone is saying. The food is alright. I had the veal surf & turf. Nice presentation, the veal was alright. The lobster was actually a big claw and it was pretty good. Lobster is lobster. But I like most the potato puree and mushrooms. 
The GF had a ribeye. It was ordered well done but came out med. The GF was none too please. You should pass on the chocolate soufflé 
Service was good. 
It's alright to go here once for the experience. It does have an amazing view.The polo towers is a great place to sleep...and only sleep. I was staying in the studio bedroom, and it was clean, had a kitchenette and a view of the strip. The location of the hotel is nice, about a 15 minute walk from the Excalibur which has a tram to some of the other hotels. Housekeeping forgot to replace our towels, so I called and they were there in15 minutes and even called after to make sure that it was done. Not much to do at the actual hotel but I didn't mind. Perfectly good place to stay as long as you dont mind having to walk a lot.We didn't stay here just toured the facility along the strip. It was fun to stop in and see everything.We stayed here from the 26-29th and just got home today. I will tell you the good the bad and the ugly of this hotel. 

THE GOOD is how wonderful the staff were. 
They were very helpful from the receptionists to the housekeepers. 
Our room was a contemporary room and so we had no issues with anything in our room. We actually enjoyed it as we were traveling as a family with two boys. They liked the hotel room more than anything, they especially liked the view they had of the pool. 

THE BAD is how much my sons eyes were red and blood shot everytime we had to walk through the casino. Being a smoker really wouldn't bother you but for a child it bothered him a great deal and my other son started a cough that lasted until after we left. When my husband or I were in the Casino we had to worry about the network going down and the slots not providing us with the pay out we were entitled to. So we wasted countless hours waiting around for someone to come to our machine to help even thought the machine indicated it was in need of some assistance with the light blinking at the top. Half the time more lights were blinking than not blinking. 

THE UGLY was the same as the other reviews....The timeshare people. They are relentless and if it wasn't for my husband I would have gotten into something that I didn't want any part of. They immediately come off as if they are people trying to offer you a good deal on shows and draw you in but then they let you know that you will need to go see or do something for them that will only take 2 hours. WRONG it will take ALL day and if you only have 3 days in Vegas you now will only have 2. Good Luck!!!

My family and I will look into staying at NYNY, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, or even MGM next time as there were much better Casino's and shops within these hotels. 

***The TOURNAMENT OF KINGS was great but you don't have to be staying at the hotel to go see it. I would just catch the show but stay somewhere else if you are looking for the VEGAS experience.Service: 
Great. The servers at the drive thru were nice, and our food was ready for us when we got to the window. 

Price: 
$10 for two burgers is pretty expensive.. not including drinks or a combo. 

Food: 
We got two of the new ciabatta bacon cheeseburgers, and I thought they were really good. I probably won\t buy it again though, just because of the price.TOUR: So it all started out booking online at looktours.com. You get some pretty good discounts here rather than going to the company website directly. We booked the tour with the helicopter ride to Grand Canyon, tour of a cowboy ranch near the canyon with lunch there and optional horseback riding ($40 pp).
They picked us up at our hotel in a white van at around 11:30am and we rode to the airport about 5 minutes away right next to the Las Vegas commercial airport. We then signed our lives away and paid the $40 pp airport fee, and watched an instructional safety video that had lots of advertisements for their dvd you can purchase. Afterwards we waited about an hour to actually get onto a helicopter. Geeez!! We had booked all day there but still an hour? 
Once getting onto the helicopter we started our ascent. Our pilot on the way there was great! Taught us a lot giving us neat little facts about each landmark. However, the pilot on the way back was pretty much mute. Bummer but did answer questions when we asked them.
We arrived at the ranch and got on a 5 minute horsedrawn carriage ride to the ranch. We had lunch which consisted of BBQ chicken, cole slaw, baked beans, corn bread, and water. Vegetarian options were available so I got the veggie burger patty, which must be specified beforehand. While we ate lunch we were serenaded by a cowboy in a guitar that sang extemporaneously songs that were tailored to the guests. Since we were from Georgia he sang a song about peaches. Actually, pretty impressive how good he was on the fly. 
Obama was coming into town that day so they were closing down all the airspaces at 4:30pm. Thus we didn't have time to spend at the ranch which was an integral part of the package! We didn't even get to do horseback riding as we were promised the opportunity! Outrageous. We were quickly ushered away at lunch only getting to pet the horses a little then we were off back to the helicopter.
On the way back we had a more scenic view the canyon, Ring of Fire (rock formations that are red), and the strip. We got back by 4:30 to the hotel.
RETAIL: They have a little shop of souvenirs at their office including cowboy hats, sunglasses, etc. They also sell the dvd that you can share the cost of if you are riding with other groups since they offer a better deal with more dvd's that are ordered. We didn't get one since we had our camera video. 
RULES: No pictures allowed while outside the helicopter at the airport but once inside the helicopter any media is allowed. Every person is required to pay a $40 airport fee not quoted on any tour costs you will find online.
SERVICE: Very good! Including the staff at the office and ranch, pilots. 
PRICES: With airport fees included, the cost was about $300 pp. The manager did refund me $179 due to our shortened stay at the ranch giving us the difference between the helicopter tour without the ranch tour plus an inconvenience refund. We should have gotten refunded more.
CONCLUSION: Pricey but a wonderful experience.  Stars docked due to shortened trip due to Obama and time wasted due to waiting. The family loved it as they had never been in a helicopter before. Probably next time though would want to experience the grand canyon in a another way like river rafting, hiking, going to the skywalk.This place has so much potential but its always a ghost town whenever I go. Hidden inside the quiet Monte Carlo Hotel is Market City Cafe which is a transplant from the San Gabriel Valley in California. Its a pretty decent northern italian cuisine but the prices are way out of whack! Spaghetti bolognese and the lasagna are my favs but def not worth the prices. I give this place a 81/100...could of been higher if not the high priced foodThis is,along with the Sahara,Frontier and Riviera the oldest property
on the Strip. Unlike those others,however,this one doesn't show its
age,at least not in the guest rooms. They've been nicely updated,and
are a real value,as the thousands of elderly tourists who flock here
to see Wayne Newton will tell you. Pools are decent but have long 
since been overshadowed by the newer  hotels. If you get a great
rate and have a car this is not a bad choice. Keep in mind you'll have
to drive or shuttle to get to the better part of town.My brother and i were suckered into having the $9.99 steak with the draft beer.  for a $1.50 more you get the salad. You get mashed potatoes and some vegetables which was okay. I would give it a 2 1/2 stars, but I rounded up because the service was fast and the food came up.  Anyways the steak was dried until you got into the middle. The steak was a NY strip, but mine was sort of dry for the most part and chewy.  But what you pay is what you get.

As far as the casino, they do have video blackjack which I like and you do sign up for the $5 dollar free slot play unfortunately out of 20 tries, i did not win anything back so I figured that I probably should not put any money back into this sucker =)Reasonable place located about a mile away from the strip!  Rooms are not bad either!  Wish the waiter service was better!So I had the veggie burger. It was not a garden burger that you buy in the frozen aisle of a grocery store. there was a veggie patty, but they added zucchini, yellow squash, and others. They also added salsa, which i did not like. Overall, okay sandwich, okay restaurant, but I would not necessarily come back here.Didn't have the 4.99 steak and eggs deal when I came this time. Instead it was 7.99 for steak, green beans, steak fries, and a garden salad. Also a root beer..which was a nice touch.

Food came out quickly and was decent for the price. Service sucked because the place was understaffed.I'm doing this... And I will revel in its failure.. lol.. I am referring to the late night Karaoke situation at Ellis Island Brewery. There are few things that are as much fun when you are having a drink with friends.. as karaoke both good and bad!

Every so often I get a hankering' to head on down and have a go at the mic. As an added b onus.. Ellis Island has root beer that they brew themselves..and why am I so excited about that you wonder? ...1 (hyphenated) word.. "JAGER-Roo" It's (2) shot(s) Jagermeister in a tall glass of fresh brewed root beer. It will make you a believer. I love Italian, German and many other herbal liquors .. but Jagermeister was my first. Therefore, it will always be my baby ;')

if you are even remotely interested in how delicious this could be dancing around your palate with hints of sweetness, herbs and sassafras.. .. I say go for it. Also, maybe stop in for some Karaoke. 

Have Fun!The steak was ok for the price. Yeah I could of paid $40 for a good steak at the strip. But when your in a budget this place is not that bad.After booking my room on priceline I read a bunch of bad reviews on the web and was dreading my stay there. Since I named my price on priceline there was no way I could get out of it... and I tried. I was stuck! 

Check-in went smooth, I was greeted by friendly, helpful staff. The casino's air filter system was noticeable better than some of the other casinos I had visited. The room was surprisingly nice!! The room looked like it had been recently remodeled, current decor, clean, and a flat screen TV with a nice view of the courtyard and pool. The beds were very comfortable which included extra pillows, synthetic down comforters and a pillow top mattress. The bathroom was clean, modern and stocked with Bath & Body soap, lotion, etc. All that and I only spent $40 for the room on priceline (and that was for a Friday night)!!!!

My only complaint would be how early they close down the pool area (7pm on a Friday night) but they have a life guard on staff and in Las Vegas's present economic situation, I guess shutting down the pool early isn't unreasonable. 

It is located at the end of the strip, across the street from Circus Circus. If you are looking to walk out of your hotel and see a roller coaster, pirate ship and/ or Celine Dion then it probably isn't a good location. 

I am not sure why there are so many bad reviews online? Perhaps some bitter gamblers that went home broke, or some unreasonable tourists that couldn't afford a real vacation so they ended up going to Vegas looking for that Paris vacation and left disappointed??3.5 stars.

There's not much to say about this place except that everything here was M&M branded.  You name it - mugs, shirts, toys, kitchen stuff  - all have the words "M&M" on it.  Honestly, I wouldn't buy anything here because I don't need or want any of the stuff.  Sure M&Ms taste good but do you really need a M&M-branded shirt or cup? lol  It was just fun to look around at all the floors (3 I think) and see nothing but M&Ms.

If you are a hardcore M&M fan, then this place is a must see; other than that, there's nothing much to see.Wow good times here :)
not overly crowded.. but that could be because of the 30$ cover lol
The drinks are good.
Ciggies are 12$
amazing night thoughDefinitely a place to go to avoid over paying for food...

The Harley Davidson cafe is...exactly as the name says, Harley Davidson through and through. A giant chain American Flag serves as the back drop for this American restaurant. Harley Davidson memorabilia all throughout the restaurant gives anyone ADD because you'll keep staring at everything here ahaha.

The prices are moderate, in the $10 - $25 range so it's not jacked up like everything else in Vegas where you'll pay $10 just for a hot dog and fries. 

"The Best BBQ in Vegas" is what  they boast and at least for me, live up to the billing. I got the "Wild Hog BBQ Plate" which is a plate featuring the different meats in BBQ.

The pulled pork, ribs and chicken were all very tender. The ribs fell off the bone with a nice rub crust over the rib giving it a multi-dimension in flavor and texture. Chicken was very juicy and not dry like most places serve "bbq chicken."

3 Stars because the food isn't the most spectacular or complex but it isn't bad either. So if you're looking for a place in Vegas that's not a buffet, come here, it's worth itTypical bar food, with not typical bar prices.  I know its Vegas and most things are on the pricey side, but yikes $50 for lunch that was a Caesar wrap and a burger with no alcohol??  My bank account was not so thrilled.  If it was $50 and out-of-this-world tasty, I'd be ok spending that much.

Waitress was super nice and had this lad back appeal to her, I appreciate when a waiter doesn't put on some "OHMYGOD" type of show and is just themselves and nice and not pushy. 

It is definitely in a good spot on the strip, right in the middle.Located on the 2nd floor of inside NY, NY hotel. There is a $10 cover for guys but any groups of girls get in for free. Drinks were pretty crazy with $7 import beers and $16 JagerBombs. There is a small stage and waitresses and entertainers dance on. They often let other girls dance on there too. It's a pretty small place with an older crowd and mostly guys. Nonetheless, it had high energy and it was pretty fun.Not the greatest Mexican food I've ever had, but certainly not the worst.  The waiter wasn't that great, but he did ensure fast service.  I ordered the chicken tortilla soup, the cheapest thing on the menu, and quite tasty as well.  The soup had generous portions of chicken (this is nice because restaurants skip out on meat portions quite often).  Instead of traditional red salsa, they give you salsa verde and another dip that tastes similar to guacamole, but in a salsa form.  Good food for a good price, but there's nothing special about this place.Gosh, I love Mexican. Fish tacos are quite possibly my favorite food of life so when I saw grilled fish tacos on Gonzalez y Gonzalez's menu, I had no doubt that's what I was going to order. We popped in before heading to the Jimmy Buffett concert at the MGM so we were on a margarita-drinking roll when we stopped by. The food was good, but it was pretty standard Mexican (not that that's a bad thing); not particularly creative but nevertheless a good, decently-priced fish taco with good service. Since we were heading to the concert, we opted for their oversized margarita (the 48oz. behemoth) for the road. For $20, it's hard to beat considering we were paying $8-10 a pop for margaritas elsewhere. All around, good Mexican and perfect for a casual bite.Had high hopes in this place after reading the many raving reviews about this place. I have to admit, was a bit skeptical when I heard it was at Circus Circus, but hey, I'm game and it's won best steakhouse for 2 decades. Two decades. That's quite some time, yeah?

Word of advice. Don't get all dolled up when you go to this place as you will feel very awkward. I was all decked out in a mini black dress and high heels because we were going to head over to Prive afterwards. Wished that I had on flip flops and some casual attire. So out of place. 

With that aside, I ordered the rib eye {bone in} with baked potato, house salad with ranch dressing and the cheesecake + banana foster for dessert. Later on why I ordered two desserts. 

The bread basket was good. It was filled with an assortment of breads and they were warm! Hence, the added star. Seriously. 

Salad was eh. Thought some of the lettuce was a bit wilted. Nothing really to talk about. The steak felt charred and there was really no taste whatsoever. It wasn't even that tender, either. The cheesecake tasted as though it's been in the refrigerator for AGES. However, the banana foster quickly made up for it as it was muy deliciso. I highly recommend this dessert! 

 I was secretly hoping that this place was going to win me over and take the place of Ruthchris's or Morton's. Sadly, it didn't and it was a huge disappointment. The prices are really reasonable {for a steakhouse}. My rib eye was $44 and it included a salad, and a baked potato. No a la carte menu here. 

Probably wouldn't want to return here, unfortunately. Although, if you are a big prime rib eater, my eating companions  say that they prime rib tasted much better than the steak.We had friends visiting from Seattle who love Vegas and had heard this place was great and wanted to go try it. I hadn't heard much about it as a Vegas local but was hoping for the best.  
4 stars for the ambiance its that old red leather dark Mobby Italian renaissance decor that makes you yearn for the Vegas of the past.
4 stars also for the wait staff who is professional and hard working and striving to make sure you never have an empty glass and just the perfect amount of banter.

Ok now for the bad news, the food was only 2 stars.

While there we had:
 The Spinach Salad with hot bacon dressing - this was nothing special definitely more deserving to be highlighted at a mid market family restaurant.

The Chopped Salad- decent but again nothing special.

Petite Filet w garlic mashed and green beans- Sorry can't use the words great to describe it . The green beans were the standout.

Porterhouse- Not cooked correctly filet Ok but other side tough and overcooked which in my mind is completely ridiculous for a steak house where you are paying 50 plus for a steak.

Desserts- looked good but frankly after being underwhelmed by  dinner didn't take the plunge.

Final issue, was when we were done we were at the CIrcus Circus not anywhere to grab a quiet after drink. except the bar in restaurantCame here with a prix fix menu. First up, free bread and butter. Then shrimp cocktail with three accompanying sauces. Shrimp were plump, fresh, and served at the right temperature. Good start, bad finish. 

Next dish was the Del Frisco house salad. Good balance of toppings and delicious dressing - minus the fruit fly. How does an upscale steakhouse allow that to happen? I was pretty embarrassed for them. But I let the manager know and he replaced my salad and treated the table to the infamous VIP martini. Nice recovery. Onto the entree. 
 
Order the ribeye. Perfect amount of marbling for extra fatty juicy goodness. Pretty good portion too - I couldn't finish my steak. Sides were forgettable. Green beans were fresh but greasy, as were the cheesy potatoes. For dessert I had their cheesecake topped with strawberry sauce. Again nothing unique, but something sweet to finish the meal is always a nice treat. 

Probably wouldn't return again as there are plenty of other places in Vegas that are worth trying.Food was decent/a-okay. A little bit over priced IMO. Then again, this happens way too often with all the "fine dining" restaurants I've been to around the world. 
Portions were big enough to be very filling.

Ambiance wasn't quite I imagined it to be. I thought it would be more quiet and romantic. Instead, it was very loud and crowded. I felt like as if I was at Chilis or TGIF. I would prefer my pricier restaurants to feel classier.

Note: Even though I made reservations, I still had to wait in line for 45 minutes. Apparently there were 6 other groups/couples with reservations who 'checked in' before me. Not sure how that works.

Also, there is a dress code.

Minus 2 stars for the price, loud atmosphere and wait time.I stopped by this Einstein Brothers this morning to get  1/2 dozen bagels.  I so wanted salt bagels, but they had none, even at 7:30 AM.  In the end, I got two everything, 2 - three cheese, and two pretzel bagels - like a salt bagel, but made with a darker wheat so it looks like a soft pretzel.

My biggest surprise was the price.  For 6, the tab was just over $7.  There was an additional charge for the pretzel bagels and for the three cheese.  I had one of the pretzel bagels when I got home.  It was good, but I think I'll just get a couple of bagels at Albertson's and go to Einstein when I want something more exotic.

They used to give a shmear tub with  1/2, but evidently that ended.I came here with two of my Co workers for Ken M's UYE Pizza, Peppers, and Pints event. Unfortunately I didn't see anyone from Yelp so we sat in the bar area because my co workers didn't want to sit around children. 

I really wanted to order some of their Sleeners but my co workers and I are participating in a weight loss challenge. That means we shared two salads. We ordered the Greek Salad and the Buffalo Mozzarella Salad. I mostly ate the Buffalo salad. It had mixed greens, Roma Tomatoes, sliced Buffalo Mozzarella, and we had the Balsamic dressing on the side. The croutons were two small slices of  toasted French bread. Everyone was being good and didn't really want to eat them except for me. I mainly had veggies all day and needed some substance! The two salads can easily be shared between three people with enough to take home. It also makes you full fast!Rocco's is strictly ok - borderline meh. I lived on Long Island, and know a good pizza place. That said, for Vegas my expectations are not set too high. Still, Rocco's LOOKS like a real NY deli. Of course, the uniforms on employees immediately reminds us we're not in New York anymore, though they are still a nice presentation. 

As for the food:
The 'garlic knots' are more butter/cheese knots than anything. I don't remember tasting a hint of garlic in them. 

The wings:
Ordered medium. Approximately 80% butter and  the rest what tasted like Frank's buttery wing sauce. All very buttery so far. 

The spaghetti and meatballs: The marinara is quite good. The pasta was ever-so-slightly past al dente, but okay. The meatballs were heavy in basil, and tasted better broken in pieces and twirled in the pasta than by themselves. The meatballs also had large pieces of breadcrumbs inside them - which didn't affect the flavor experience, but was not the most aesthetically pleasing.

I was given the dinner portion and did not find out they had a lunch special until I paid my bill. 

For a displaced New Yorker, there a couple of places in town that truly offer the tastes of home and Rocco's is not one of them - though they come close with few items.  

Yet, the food is convincing enough that the Summerlin crowd will not know the difference, hence my giving the place 3 stars.This is the second Sports Chalet I have been to and this one didn't seem as friendly as the other one. Walking around the store, none of the people that worked there said hello (like the other ones I've been to). I eventually found what I was looking for but I think I would go back to the other one in the southwest next time.For the fourth of July I decided to take my mom to have dinner some place different. This is different as in you just don't get this food anywhere. Famous for their catfish which is what I usually get. All you can eat at a decent price. When you arrive it is like a shack down south. Peeling paint on the walls and that homey feeling. What I order every so often is the alligator. Yeah that's right, those reptiles that will eat you in a heartbeat. Deep fried and pretty tasty. The service was outstanding and they have specials Monday through Thursday. Which include all you can eat crab legs to all you can eat ribs. I think it is a place you can just enjoy. Only reason I don't give them a higher rating is the variety of food. I'm one of those variety is a spice of life idiots. Please Please do not forget to try the pickled green tomatoes at the salad bad (included in most meals) I could eat a plate of just that.I've eaten at 3 or 4 Melting Pot locations around the country, and if I had been on yelp 7 years ago, I probably would have given this place 4 or even 5 stars.  The evening is fantastic, it takes about 2.5 hours or more, and it's a great pace.  You are never in a rush, and it's certainly a different way to dine.

So, when we went to Melting Pot last night, I was troubled to learn that the menu had changed.  The Big Night Out which we had shared so many times was gone, replaced with a more a la carte ordering system.  You order by the person now, still having to share the cheese and dessert courses with the table as a whole.  Already, I was annoyed by the change in the menu.  THEN, I open the wine list to find fewer than 10 wines by the glass in white, even fewer in red, and only a page of wines period.  This is much, much less than Melting Pot used to have. I pointed this out to our server, and she informed me I was correct, the wine list had been paired down significantly.  Apparently the decision was made to simplify things.  Of course, I imagine stocking pricier bottles was not paying off, and I certainly understand a restaurant needing to make changes based on the bottom line.  But, it certainly affected my meal and will affect my decision whether to come in the future.

The meal was a solid Melting Pot meal.  We had the Wisconsin trio, an excellent blend of cheeses.  We asked our server to go heavy on the blue cheese and garlic, and she obliged in spades.  Excellent flavor.  The cajun platter and lobster fusion were next, and while good, the meat course left a little to be desired.  I feel like the portions are smaller, but I can't prove this.  I will say the shrimp was the favorite meat, and that's saying something when we ordered a dish with steak and lobster.  A tip if you eat here, put the mushrooms and potatoes in IMMEDIATELY.  The potatoes still weren't completely cooked by the end of the meal.  That's always been an issue with Melting Pot.  I would think there is a way to fix it, but I haven't seen it yet.

The dessert was the star of the meal.  We had the white chocolate creme brulee.  White chocolate with caramelized sugar drizzled on top.  Excellent, very glad we tried the special dessert.  My favorite in meals past was always the main course, but today it was the desserts.  I'm not saying we won't come back to Melting Pot, but the chances are much slimmer than they were yesterday before our meal.When in a pinch, and in the mood for Mediterranean- this place will suffice. 
We ate lunch. I had the vegetarian plate, and the hubby had a gyro sandwich. Both plates were generous in portion. The gyro meat was a little processed looking, I doubt it was actually carved by someone other than a factory worker. But they had delicious sauces, and the seasoning was spot on. The hostess seemed annoyed, but we had a super nice server(Lisa?). 
In short: they're pretty alright. Not sure if I'll go back, but if I was taken there I wouldn't run.Mentioning my name in certain circles is verboten. Never mention Rex Marvin at the San Antonio Community  Quilting Bee...apparently quilting the greatest moment of your sexual history isn't appropriate for a 12 year old looking to enter the competitive world of quilting.  Never mention Rex Marvin at the National Bowling Stadium...apparently streaking across the lanes with "This Isn't A Real Sport" on your buttocks is a faux pas.  The beer and bratwurst crowd can be a touchy one.  Never mention Rex Marvin at the Birmingham Alabama "Is This Your Sister or Your Wife" Blueberry Festival...apparently screaming "anyone who didn't take a bath with your future wife as kids aren't really married in this state" is a little too close to the truth for most. (On a side not, moonshine, incest and the bible is a dangerous combination. A lot of bad ideas are formulated.)  And never...ever...ever mention the name of Rex Marvin at the Kentucky Apple Festival...I will just say this...when someone tells me there is an apple festival...and there is no Apple Spinach Lasagna then you get what you deserve...and if that means holding the Apple Queen down (a guy in a dress by the way)...and putting apples in every cavity...then you take it like a man...a man in a dress with shaved legs and a date that couldn't tell he was a man.
 
In most Mexican food restaurants...chain restaurants... there is a written rule to ban Rex Marvin on sight. They won't announce this policy...if you mention Rex Marvin they will call the cops and have you escorted out.  Only Del Taco has publicly stated on a Danish Crime Show roughly translated as "Man Who Can't Salt Fish Correctly" that I will be killed even if I try to go through the drive thru.  I have taken that on as a badge of all that is right in the world.  (Secretly, I go in to Del Taco's and eat their crappy food while writing 'Tom Sizemore banged your mom' on bathroom stall walls.)
  
I take Mexican food very seriously, because it is great when you just take great ingredients and don't mess them up. Most places use over processed crappy ingredients and used heavily handed sauces.  Fresh, simple and flavorful. Chain Mexican food restaurants seem to remove the flavor when they defrost the meat outside in the sun.  Canned vegetables. Premade sauces. Frozen food. Is there any reason that 4 of my 9 felony convictions have been committed in a fast food Mexican place? Instead of the Twinkie Defense I used the Canned Crap defense.
 
When I woke up behind a Rubio's after 3 days of snorting bath salts and Pine Sol. Trust me it is something that is really best left to the professionals.  I woke up to a great smell...actually I woke up to 3 guys carrying trash cans and drinking low grade sake out of a plastic jug.  Three shots later I was ready to eat. Nice guys. Bought two Chinese stars and some fireworks.  They kept smiling and speaking Finnish...weird blonde bastards.
 
I went into Rubios and it was a revelation. Very reasonable priced. Very good food. All of the chips are made fresh daily. The standout is the fish taco.  I have gone back several times and I have bought the battered fish tacos (I suggested calling it the Rihanna but they didn't go for it) and they were great every time. Get the Especial, very good guacamole and cilantro. Worth the 40 cents.  The Burritos are very good and a good size for the price. The salad has a lot of good things in it, not just lettuce and the blows are good if you are into that. They are light.  The taquitos are good, but not crispy enough the time I got it. The main thing is that this place uses great ingredients. The times I have eaten there I have loved the food.  Is it as good as a great local place...no, it can't be. It is still a chain, but a good chain...like the one from my scrotum to my nipple. 

It does have a decent sauce bar. The three sauces range from very good to okay. They have roasted pepper sauce and the best one. There is a salsa verde, but it is the weakest one. They have a spicy piccante which is good, but one note.

The bad...the sides are not great. The beans are just awful. Very soupy. Not much flavor. The rice was dry. The sides are very important and seem like an after thought here. Sad, because it would be better rated if they cared about their side dishes. 

I won't eat there all the time. I won't eat there when I have better alternatives, but I will go back. I like it. I don't love it. It is how I feel about the girl who I peep into her windows. I like her enough to look...not enough to stalk. Fine line? Yes. A line nonetheless? Yes.It pains me to have to give this place only 3 stars because the food at Roy's is usually of 5 star quality, but my last trip to this particular location wouldn't have been worthy of even 1 star.

It's not a stretch to say we had the worst service I have ever encountered in any restaurant, anywhere.  Our waiter was, not to put too fine a point on it, an idiot.  And a dishonest one at that.  He didn't seem to know much about what was on the menu or what the specials were.  But 2 things really angered me: he kept pushing drinks on my mother - apparently after the 3rd "no thank you" at his drink recommendations he still hadn't gotten the message.  And here's where the dishonest part came in: he clearly forgot to put my order in for Roy's out-of-this-world chocolate souffle, as he was asking if we wanted the check before I had received it.  When reminded that I ordered it, he got a deer-in-the-headlights look on his face, and instead of admitting that he forgot to put the order in (which I would have been FAR more understanding of) he said it was "just about ready".  He then ran back to the kitchen, and must have asked one of the cooks to rush one out, because 10 minutes later I was presented with something that had the consistency of a hockey puck.  At that point we just wanted to get out of there - service was painfully slow throughout the meal, and we were beyond ready to leave.

In all fairness I must say I had dined at the Charleston Blvd location a year earlier, and had outstanding service and delicious food, including the souffle that oozed sinfully warm and wonderful chocolate when cut into.  So this year's trip was probably a fluke, but until I return and get at least decent service, I'm giving this location 3 stars.I know it's an ayce sushi joint and not to expect amazing sushi but I thought the fish wasn't as good as the other ayce places in Vegas. It was packed when I went and the tables are a little too close to each other. I felt we were eating with the party next to us. They were nice and friendly and we ended up talking to them anyway but usually, I like my space at restaurants.

Despite their so-so sushi, their hot foods were pretty good especially their deep fried mussels and hamachi kama. I would come back for that. 

Service wavered between good and ok. We were greeted and seated right away but at times, I was wondering where the server was to put in our extra orders.

I think I"ll just stick to the ayce sushi joints in my hood, SW Vegas.DO NOT ORDER THE SWEET SHRIMP. The seafood salad is banging though. I always use the left over sauce for dipping.OK.  So we don't have an Olive Garden in Hawaii.  You know how much I hate their commercials?  They mock me!!!  Therefore, when I was offered a chance to hit Olive Garden in Vegas I was in!  

All you can eat soup and breadsticks?  No lie!  Also, the service was excellent!  Our waitress was very patient and gave great suggestions for dinner.  So nice :)

My company mentioned that other Olive Gardens that they've visited were not as good.  I was pleased with this one.  We all stuck with the pasta and didn't go wrong there.

I'm planning on heading back the next time I'm in Vegas.  Hopefully I'll be super hungry and can get seconds on soup and breadsticks!!!This is just an ok place to come for some edible food. The food is good, actually. The service, not so much. They are not necessarily mean, just slow. More often than not we have waited much too long after being seated for someone to come and ask our drink. After our drinks come, it seems they rarely get filled and it takes way too long for the server to return even to check on us. Meh.This is for 3.5 stars. I really wanted mediterranean food and since this is on the way home from work, I stopped here on friday night for takeout. I ordered the chicken schewarma pita sandwich and two pieces of falafel (@ 99 cents each). The guy at the counter was cordial but not enthusiastic, kinda felt like he was getting through the last part of the day. I waited for my food; it was a short wait. There were two other parties in the dining area, which was nice. From the outside, it looks really small, but on the inside, it's a square-shaped space, and nicely decorated. Located across from UNLV, in the largest strip mall, with various other restaurants such as the Lunchbox. Another customer for takeout was behind me. I noticed that for yelpers who check-in, you get a free piece of baklava. If you're a UNLV student, you get a free drink when you show your ID. 

I went home and couldn't wait to devour it. I let my husband have a bite of each (he's on a weight maintenance plan) and he liked it. He's never had this type of food. I did like the food- the pita was soft, the tahini sauce tasted good, but the chicken tasted like it was charred (think charcoal), and I couldn't shake it. I've been particularly sensitive lately to certain things, maybe it was an off day, I don't know. I really wanted to like this place. I thought it was me. And when I had the falafel, I also got the same charred taste, but I also noticed that it was slightly burned, too. My favorite place for mediterranean is all the way in Summerlin (Sultan's Grill), which is far away from our area, so I thought I'd try a convenient place. I would try this place again, maybe get a plate next time. Plus, my husband's never had mediterranean food so it be worth trying again.I prefer this Vons because even through the remodeling phase they had a year ago, the staff were really helpful to make sure we got what we needed and could find it. The place was being upgraded and they had to close down early for a few weeks, maybe a month, but after that, the place is great! it is always clean, the staff is still awesome, the security guards are very nice about walking people to their cars if they need to, and everything is easy to find. 

Vons prices are pretty fair to me. I use my rewards card and the price gets knocked down even more, got to love that! The wine and other booze is pretty cheap then most places I know. Plus, a great selection as well. So many choices, so many wines to taste! 

The surrounding population that may come to Vons can be a bit creepy, but overall I feel safe walking here from the University when I need to grab some stuff or even a cup of their soup they make on a daily basis. Mexican Tortilla Soup-Yum!

It really is not as bad as the reviews are making it, I agree with Ashley B.'s post!Ulta gets high marks because it carries both expensive and inexpensive brands, generally has good amount of merchandise in stock and offers consistent coupons. Customer service on the other hand is next to non existent. When you do get some service they try to push a certain line of cosmetic down your throat (LOOK LADY, I already know Lancome foundation does not interact well with my skin) instead of listening to YOUR needs as a customer.. sigh. I will go back because I get coupons which I like to spend on my alarmingly large collection of OPI nail polish.This store being a place for supplies to keep myself beautiful (self-assessment) should have garnered at least five stars. I mean, I love a one-stop shop where I can indulge in beautiful make-up, find things for my hair, my nails, every part of me! What I don't enjoy is bad employees. 

The employees here, I THINK, are working on commission. Went in to buy a fabulous Clarisonic for my face and immediately two women swooped in to help. I have to believe this is not because they are the friendliest bunch, but because there is a payoff for them. Mainly because once one girl edged out the other one she was trying to sell me the door knobs. 

So, the truth is, I'm 44. That is bad in a lot of ways, but fabulous in that I know what I need in order to look good. I've been doing this for a long time. So, talk to the girl about this product and tell her I use a certain brand of cleanser. I love it, I will not part with it, I don't need recommendations to change it. I just need to know if it's safe to use with the apparatus I'm about to buy. She tells me yes, but she has an even BETTER face wash. I tell her that I understand my skin, but she keeps pushing. After a few minutes she stopped, realizing defeat. I then asked for my fave moisturizer, EVER. She again tried to tell me that wasn't blah blah. No, point me to it, thank you. By the time I got through my list of beauty needs I was exhausted! 

So, on the one hand, they have the overly helpful staff (read: pushy), but I walked up to this one girl who quickly tried to turn her back on me as she saw me coming. That wasn't obvious. I asked her, to her back, if she could tell me where I could find a certain section. She grudgingly pointed. Well, thanks for trying to do your job. That you get paid for.

Went up to the counter to ask for help with some eye shadow. No one had a clue, but if people kept pointing me to places where I might be able to find it, I was going to throw down on the ground and start flailing. If I was paid to do your job I'd at least act like I didn't totally hate it and wish it would die.

Anyway, the only reason this store gets three stars is because it has everything I need for my beauty regimen, otherwise zero stars for the incredible helpfulness of the employees.Disclaimer: I may or may not have been slightly impaired after the Sancho margarita I had at Diablo's Cantina prior to visiting the LV Outlet Mall.

This store is really big and they have a ton of cheap accessories and that's what I really came in to look for. I found a nice (undamaged) big pair of black, grey and white thread teardrop earrings for $6 that don't irritate my ears at all. They're light weight and dangle and sway in just the right way, and were still a little cheaper than comparable pairs found in the trendy  vintage stores on Haight St. in San Francisco.

You'll also find hoards of colorful, tacky, clingy clothing (as expected), and bins of trashy panties on sale. For those of you not familiar with the chain store, it's similar to Forever 21 and Wet Seal.

My only complaint is that there was only one cashier at the register and there were 5+ customers in line. Still, I waited for 10-15 minutes to save just a few dollars. It must've been the alcohol. But I do love these earrings."Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun."  Has a nice ring to it, right?  

Too bad that is for McDonalds Big Mac and not Jack In The Box's Bonus Jack.  The Bonus Jack just falls short, in my opinion.  I'm not sure if there were onions on it or not.  Shredded lettuce for sure.  But what looked like possible onions may have been,  in fact, tiny bits of lettuce.  And there was no sesame seed bun.  The sauce is different too.  More red than the secret sauce on the Big Mac and a bit sweeter.  The burgers are very similar to each other.  Call me a traditionalist but I prefer the Big Mac hands down.  From the onions to the sauce, the Big Mac is a superior classic.Was going to attempt to go this weekend but found out yesterday from the one on Fort Apache that this one is CLOSED.I order delivery nearly every time. They always say 30 - 45 mins but always arrive in 20mins. Over the phone they it can be a little bit of a challenge.

I've eaten lunch a few times and it isn't that bad. Semi clean and the service is par.
The combo fried rice is pretty good with most chicken dishes not too bad.

Look this place isn't a 5 star restaurant but they do serve you the food you need at the time, and in time.It was ok, the delivery was very good, 15 mins tops. Maybe because I have a Chinese last name...they are skimpy in the shrimp, the terriaki chicken was too saucy and the rice was dry. The veggies were good and so was the beef lo mein. If I were to go there again l would stick with the lo mein dishes. Large portions for a good price.We ordered garlic fries as an appetizer, garlic chicken pasta, and chicken parmigiana. It seemed slightly bland, like it could have used more garlic, and the chopped asparagus in the garlic chicken pasta just didn't go well with the other flavors. The service was great, and the portions were large, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. I doubt that I will return, with the huge selection of restaurants in LV.Over glorified Panda Express.

Nothing great, nothing lacking. I've had better other places.

Good if you enjoy chinese food but have a phobia of chinese people.Good For Delivery

It has been an uphill battle to find good delivery Chinese food in Spring Valley/Summerlin.  Everything I"ve tried has been disappointing until last night.  Chow Mein Express is quick, cheap, and tasty.  Here is what we ordered:

Pork w/ string beans in spicy garlic - Very delicious sauce makes this spicy dish good, but the pork was fatty and chewy.  The string beans remained crisp in the sauce, which saved the dish.

Fried Chicken Wings - Fantastic!  Not too greasy, prepared with chili oil, diced jalapenos, scallions, and garlic.  This was the best thing we ordered.  It was more salty than spicy.

Sweet n' Sour Chicken - High quality white meat chicken made these little fried morsels pretty enjoyable.  The sauce was a bit bland, so I just dipped in Sriraucha sauce (Thai chili sauce w/ the rooster on the bottle) which helped a lot.

Veggie fried rice - Bland, with chunks of vegetables that would have been better cut smaller.  Not worth ordering really.

Overall this place is nothing special, but for a delivery Chinese meal it is pretty good, and worth the 40 minutes you may wait.Not great but good.Pizzeria Bianco - 3.5 STARS

As one of Phoenix's popular restaurants, I had to check out Pizzeria Bianco and see what the fuss was all about!

Known for their thin crust pizza and long hour waiting period to dine here (minus a star), I came one Friday evening with the parentals. Parking was very limited. You either valet or head across the street by an underground garage parking (which can be validated 1 hour off from Pizzeria Bianco). We ended up paying $7 after validation from our 3 hour stay within the vicinity.

As I walked in, the hostess greeted me and took my name and party #. She mentioned the wait would probably be about 1 hour and 30-45 minutes. After expecting a 2 hour wait time, she recommended to head next door in their waiting lobby which also has a bar and offers small snacks. We had a bottle of wine and insalata dish.

After waiting for a little over an hour, we were summoned by our waitress at their waiting lobby area. We were able to transfer our food and drinks next door. 

The venue is very cozy, dim lit and rustic. About 35-40% of the room is taken up by their kitchen/bar, while the rest of the area is full of tables for diners. Since it's a small area, it can also be quite loud and difficult to hear a conversation.

We were kindly greeted by our waiter, who was able to answer all of our questions and recommended items on the menu that was quite popular amongst the diners and himself. For service, we were well taken care of! (**4 STARS**)

OVERALL THOUGHTS
I think Pizzeria Bianco is a decent place for some thin crust pizza, but it was NOT worth waiting that long. You pretty much waited 2 hours, but once seated, your pizza comes in like 5 minutes. The pizza wasn't bad at all, nor was the best I've ever had. Consider it satisfying if you were to dine here, but was not memorable. I do love the fact that it is home made and the products used to generate their pizza pies are of substantial quality and of local products, but I have had better pizza in Portland and San Diego who play the same game.

Is it worth visiting if you're in the area? Yes, if you want to say you've been here.
Is it the best pizza you'll have? No

I hope that helps you out if you choose to dine here.

Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #44Chase Field is the home to the Arizona Diamondbacks (or Dbacks, I should say).  It's a rather nice field, with a good amount of seats and multiple levels.  

Located in the heart of Phoenix, this stadium became famous when it was first built.  Having a moving roof to let the sun in (or keep the rain out) was something unheard of at the time.  It is still a thing of wonders.

I've only been to a few games here, but each time that I have come, I find that the experience is good.  It usually does not completely fill up (it's pretty easy to find seats together if you are going in a group), and it makes for a great family getaway.

I would not exactly suggest that you plan on eating a full meal here... Prices are expensive, and the quality of food is not that good.  I would recommend that you eat outside of the stadium, and save room for a few drinks when you get inside.

If you have lived here for 10 years, or if you are just passing through, make sure to stop on by and see the magnificent edifice for itself.It's a quirky coffee house that serves good food and coffee. The service was good, but the ambience is geared towards starving students or supposed "free-thinking" types. I'm a published fiction writer and would not consider working on my craft in this coffee house, too much of a distraction. I have no problem coming back here for their coffee as I'm passing through, I just wouldn't enjoy my drink there.this hotel is kind of ghetto!!  when my shuttle drove me here, there were a bunch of wannabe thugs hanging outside.. the rooms aren't the best and actually kind of small but it's really cheap!!  they have an adult pool which i didn't get to check out but it's nice that they have it!!  the casino is kind of scummy but it's a casino!!  this hotel is so far from the strip so be prepared to walk or take a taxi!!  for the price for a room, you can't really complain much!  i would stay here again but i like to be closer to the strip so i don't have to drunk walk as far..Second time that me and my boyfriend have came here in the last year. Reason for only the 3-star is because its exactly as its called a-ok we probably will come back, its reasonably priced and the casino is pretty nice. It is located on the south end of the strip so if your looking for somewhere near the "heart" of the strip this isn't the place but it is only a 10-12 dollar ish cab ride depending on the traffic. The beds were fairly comfortable, and it had its only "sitting area" if you will with a tv and mini fridge. The bathroom is very very small, but the sink is outside so that does help. Overall like I said in the beginning chances are we will return because it is cheap and is "a ok"I'm torn on this spot. The space itself is nice and there's some novelty to it. I opted to dine at the bar. The bartender was ok. Nice enough at first, but then kinda disappeared and just stopped checking on people. The drink menu is a touchscreen that you tap through. That was the first time I'd ever encountered that. The martini I had was great. For food, I ordered a caesar salad and the beef stroganoff. The caesar salad was fine, but a complete waste of money. It was so tiny and uninventive. The beef stroganoff was not at all what I was expecting, but very tasty. It was a huge piece of short rib accompanied with mushroom-flavored noodles.  All combined, it was delicious and wonderful. The short rib had a lot of flavor. Overall, the bill was way too high for what I actually received. But the stroganoff sure was tasty.I really wanted to love this but it was really just OK.  We ate here before seeing David Copperfield in the MGM, who was also just OK.  The restaurant has a nice decor and bar service was very good.  However, our waitstaff were just short of terrible.  I had to ask for a drink, ask for water, finally had to ask for bread and only got it shortly before our entrees arrived.  We had a discount coupon which we purchased from  the tix4tonight booth which was the only thing that salvaged our experience.  Food was good, not great.  Presentation was mediocre and portions were small.  We have eaten in the three Emeril restaurants in NO and I hate to say it but I would not recommend this one given all the fabulous choices in Vegas.3.5 stars 

New Year's Eve at 3pm, sat at the bar and we were served immediately. The bar server was very helpful. I ordered Blue Moon on tap and boy on an empty stomach, it definitely went to my head quickly *smile*. I ordered the Hubert Keller burger $20 with sweet patoto fries and my hubby ordered an American Kobe beef burger $16 (not to be confused with the Rossini Kobe burger at $60 with truffles) with added choice of toppings + $4 and a side of onion rings. 

As I waited, I noticed that the restaurant looked like a comfy burger joint, with booths and tables. The booths each had a mini flat screen so you can watch while you eat. There are two bar areas, for those who do not want to wait for a table. Take a seat at the bar if you are hungry and want to be served immediately. 

My burger came in a foccaccia bread with loads of blue cheese. My first bite was great, a mouthful of cheese, tender meat and chewy bread. I tasted my hubby's burger and mine was definitely the winner. The hubby's Kobe burger had lots of hard bits in it and that was surprising, especially if its supposed to be a Kobe burger.

All in all a good experience but I still prefer the Perfect Burger at LBS at the Red Rock Casino. I want to say that I will come back here but even if my $20 Huber Keller burger is good, it's still does not beat out the Perfect burger.The show was OK. Out of all the shows I've seen in Vegas (I've seen quite a few) this was my least favorite. The ticket prices were $60 on SALE and we sat in the nose bleeds which made it difficult to see everything. The theater was huge and there's just these two dudes on the stage.. maybe a smaller venue would have been better? 
At any rate, the price of the show was not worth it. The show was barely an hour and a half and was allot of parlor tricks with some actual very cool tricks thrown in. 
I will say that the show is family friendly and they do allot of audience interaction. 
If you like magic and some comedy, you'll probably like this show.Bobby Flay's take on Vegas doesn't have the luster that it does in New York.  Mr. Flay's west coast version was a dream realized only 5 years ago and being situated in a place like Caesars Palace seems ideal.  After all, being the predominant cuisine is Southwest, what better location (aside from Arizona / New Mexico) than Las Vegas?

What is strange to me is that the prices are significantly higher in Las Vegas than the New York location.  A slab of fish of any type could be had for $2-3 less and this includes most of the other appetizers / entrees.  I have no problem paying more for better food, but this does not trump anything that could be had in New York.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous.  A great mix of vibrant colors surround the dining area, with a contemporary feel with an elegant twist.  The funky shapes accompanied by the eclectic decor, which really pounces on the New American theme, while retaining a Southwest element in the food.  I'd give the nod to Las Vegas over New York for ambiance and the overall interior look, however, I expect this since this location is significantly newer.

Service is fantastic.  Our waiters were extremely knowledgeable in the food and were able to make excellent recommendations that were enough to impress our guests.  The menus change often and often times it is completely different than anything offered in New York or the Bahamas.

On a whole Mesa Grill is a real decent place to catch a great meal for business and pleasure.  Most of my business meetings have been during their lunch hour, which I prefer over dinner.  It's not the best in the Bobby Flay restaurant family, but certainly not the worst.We had a reservation which we arrived early for.  We were told to wait which turned into 15-20 minutes.   That was disappointing.

Our server was Joel.  He was extremely attentive and suggested Margaritas which we both found to be on the tart side.  We had him sweeten them with Agave.

For a Tuesday night the place was packed for dinner despite the poor reviews.

I ordered the Pork tenderlon which was a little dry.  It came with a sauce that was tasty.  My girlfriend ordered the Ribeye which was HUGE.  I was extremely impressed by how much of dent she made in it.  It seemed to be cooked to order.  As per Joel's suggestion we ordered the corn as a side dish.  It was super tasty.  The highlight of the meal for me.

All in all it was one of the better meals that we had in Vegas but I would search a few other places for the overall experience.With the number of top-notch authentic mexican eateries surround La Hacienda, I don't remember much of my experiences here to be honest. The few times I have been here are because my friends really wanted their meat platter and I am too lazy/tired to disagree with them. 

So that said, their meat platters are good for groups. You get a tonne of meat to share amongst your friends, and it does fill you up significantly. As in most mexican restaurants you get your complimentary serving of chips and salsa upon seating, and feel free to ask for more if you so desire. 

There isn't a whole lot I have to say about them. If I am in the area or if I am looking for mexican food this is not my top choice. There is nothing bad about La Hacienda. They serve decent food, the service is good and the ambience/layout etc is cool. As a matter of fact there is just too much competition around the vicinity. Tough luck...A lot of fond memories at this off-strip place.....decent places to eat...good movie theater and bowling area....miss GAMA being hereI haven't stepped into the Palms in over two years.  Today, I opted to take advantage of their Senior Movie discount ( $4 movies and a popcorn/coke combo for $3 ) 

Theaters - The Brenden Theater website erroneously listed the first movie at 11:00 am - the place was closed at 11 but i could see the movie times above the ticket counter - earliest was 12.  I opted to play video poker and craps while i waited ( comments on those later )   My luck, one of the exceptions to the movie deal are movies produced by Sony ( not sure why ) - the movie i wanted to watch - by Sony ! Another ding - opted to see Django - the previews and initial two minutes of the movie had sound but a dark screen.  Someone beelined to the front and the correction was made ( though the movie was not re-started ) - decent screen and sound.

Table games - the table area was in disarray - they were putting the finishing touches on the center bar and a film crew was photographing the area.  Still, played craps - disappointed they had standard odds and no fire bet.  Still won a few hundred $$$ but i didn't like the vibe.

Video ( i don't play slots ) - on senior thursday, you get 100 points the they give  you a free gift - nothing special - one week i got $5 in free play another week i got some fake earrings - nothing special.  good variety of video poker games.

restaurants - always been a fan of their coffee shop.  I've stopped going to the crappy buffet but with 50% off for seniors i just might try the breakfast given the discounted price of $4.50.  I haven't been to n9ne in ages but i enjoyed it the 2 times i went.  The mexican place is average - i believe it's being changed as is the chinese place but not sure.  I keep seeing a banner for Chocolat but not sure where it is - i'm surer i'll try soon.

Night clubs - sorry, haven't been since the playboy club closed - used to enjoy Rain and Ghost but again - ages ago !

Since I usually visit in daytime, parking is relatively easy.

Overall, I'm curious what the Palms will morph into given all the recent changes - i might just put them back in the rotation but if the craps stays at standard odds with no fire bet, it will be at the bottom of the list.I've never stayed at the New York, New York, so this review is for the main level which includes the casinos, restaurants, etc.

I'm from New York myself and I have to say I love the restaurant level with the cobblestone walkway. The restaurants there are always crowded but they're all definitely NY themed. I also like the piano bar which also gets crowded once the music gets going.

I've never tried the roller coaster there, so I'm definitely gonna have to go back!I stayed here for freezy since my gf was here for a conference. Rooms were better than I expected and the casino itself was maybe a little below average for Vegas. Nothing really that flashy, but most people staying here are here because it's usually cheaper than on-strip locations.

My favorite part of this hotel, since I had to fend for myself during the day, was fantastically easy access to the Monorail. The Monorail starts at the Hilton (Sahara is closed) and continues by Harrah's, Bally's and ends at MGM Grand. You can walk pretty easily from those places to most of the strip. At the Hilton isn't far from the actual stop, unlike the Bally's stop which is far from the actual casino.

If you can get a fantastic rate, this is a comfortable hotel that's less insane that those on the strip. if you're looking to gamble easily on strip, but want to be a bit away from the action, this is the hotel for you!As the reviewers noted, Bally's totally missed the mark on this one. Coming from someone who has been to Europe, the Venetian's got it, Paris doesn't. The second I walked in I knew I was in a Bally's resort as it had the same layout/feel as the one in AC, only with a different theme. All the major elements are there - although cheaply, and there is no attention to detail. Husband and I grabbed crepes which were large and decent, even with the $9 price tag. So worth a look, but you probably won't linger long.I like the Paris Casino floor. The high ceilings help keep it from being too stuffy from smoke (and the paint doesn't hurt the atmosphere either). 

I attended a conference in the Paris, and it was comfortable and easy to navigate. There's plenty of food options and the streets modeled after the streets of the actual city are really cute.Impressed by the decor but the food not so much.  I guess I a sushi snob.  I'm sure the one in NY is 10 times better.  I would hope so for their sake.Awesome location, right smack dab in the middle of the strip, and with easy access to City Center.

Interior decor is nice, it's not run down or dirty.  It actually reminds me of a slightly downgraded version of the Bellagio.

Pretty simple & boring casino.  The Deal or No Deal slot (which kept giving good payout) was under maintenance 4 of the 5 times I attempted to play.  

Not much to do on this property.  But it's so close to City Center, that I didn't find this to be much of a problem.  Parking lot is also not a nightmare, so I could easily hop into my car & adventure away.  ***They will be opening two new bars in the near future, including a Minus 5 Ice Bar.  Something to look forward to.

The valet was really great.  I have to say this because at other properties, they usually yell at you for even pulling into the valet lane if you're just doing a pick up.  A friend picked me up, and the valet allowed her to just wait in the front, off to the side (instead of having to circle around again).  They were super nice and chill about it.  

The bell desk was prompt with my bags.  Upon check out, I left my luggage with the bell desk and told them I'd be getting my car from the parking lot.  As I pulled up to the front, my things were right there waiting for me.  No mix up, or anything.  

Buffet was very limited, didn't try the rest of the other eateries (there's about 7 others).  I did make visits to the nice little food court for fast eats.

I could see the pool from my room, and it was very active and crowded.  A live DJ was spinning loud music.  

Room was okay, although the drain in the tub was disturbingly clogged.  The TV is the older box kind, which meant that there were some discolorations on the display.  

I noticed that there were many families with children, something to take into consideration.

My keys kept getting deprogrammed, because the front desk had a discrepancy with my reservation.  I had to go down there 3 times, and  because it was during 4th of July weekend, the wait was horrendous.  There was someone else in line who had problems with their keys, too... Interesting.

Resort fee is low ($12+tax on my most recent stay)... Although no one explained to me all the perks that were included with it until my 3rd night there :(  In case no one informs you, it includes in-room internet, use of the fitness center, printing of tickets, and two water bottles/per day.

For the low rate I got, I'd stay again.Location is okay, close enough to walk to most other casinos on the strip if you are not handicapped or lazy. I booked a suite online, booked a smoking room. Check in time is at 3 pm. I left my bags in the car and I'm happy I did. Checked in at 3 PM and was told room would not be cleaned and ready to occupy until 5 PM. They also could not give me a smoking room despite the fact I reserved three weeks in advance. Front desk clerk was like a robot and appeared to be reading scripted responses to my questions regarding why they did not have the smoking room I requested and why the check in time is not the time she would give me my room number. If the room is not ready until 5 then that's when check in time should be, not 3. Was given my room number at 4:45 and they requested I give them another 30 minutes to "finish preparing my room". After 30 minutes went up to the room and found the housekeeper watching the television in my suite. I booted her out and needless to say did not leave her a tip. 
Pros: Free valet parking, location, good variety of food from fast food to higher end items, cleanliness, and suites are quiet even next to the ice machine. 
Cons: Room not ready until over 2 hours after check in time, did not have the room I booked and no discount was offered even though I reserved weeks in advance, bombarded with Jabawokeez music, images and merch at every turn.We have stayed here three times in the past 7 years on our annual visits to Vegas.   I think if you go with the rightg mindset it's a great place.  Mindset being LOTS OF KIDS!  It has a great lazy river pool but that does draw families with kids.  The one and only time we took our teenager sons to Vegas we did stay there and it was appropriate but if you're a couple looking for a swanky and romantic place don't stay here. It does have a great food court and the rooms are adeqate.   It is centrally located so waking to lots of places is also great.3 Stars.

We walked into Monte Carlo feeling great but it took us at least 30 mins just to check in... pretty ridiculous!

I give it 3 stars not for the room but for other things such as the location, ease of getting to other hotels, and the other hotel amenties.

The hotel room itself needed serious help. I have been on plenty of cruises and the toilet flush reminded me of a cruise boat... loud and noisy!

The bed was HARD and we were annoyed because we booked a king bed back in June and we came late August and had two beds! We had to wait until 3pm the next day to swap out. UGH! How annoying to drag all your stuff and move rooms.

The internet was free but no wireless which was annoying. I never use desks in hotels, especially in Vegas so they really need to look into having a password system or something!

The actual room amenties were yucky, the soap was hard, the water was hard coming out of the yucky shower head. The towels stunk and it was just all around not that great. Luckily for us we left the room more often than not.

The buffet was just okay. The food was just okay for brunch... they do have unlimited mimosas for $2 extra but it wasnt quite worth it to me. The crab was the best thing there.

Beware the $15 resort fee they charge you at checkout. Get what you can from it, use the pool! It was SO much fun with the DJ and I think they were having contests and things which was entertaining! 

The Brand Steakhouse night club was nice. You get hounded by so many people asking if you want to go, that we decided to check it out. Friday night was girls night I guess where everyone pays $20 cover but girls drink free. I love that you can exit and enter and come back after you gamble a bit. The music was great, a mix of hip hop and pop and house/techno. We danced quite a bit and felt that the $20 was worth it!

The location was perfect! You can walk to New York New York and catch the tram all the way to Mandalay Bay or you can catch one to Aria and Crystals and Bellagio. You can walk basically to Ceasars without a cab or catch a cab and hit the other part of the strip.

The other reason we had reservations here was because the really good show Jabbawockeez was playing here so we only had to get dressed and go downstairs, PLUS!

We were so close to Planet Hollywood and the ABC store, UA theatre, Hard Rock and the little flea market to get little trinkets.

Overall the location is what you pay for so if you dont intend on sleeping, stay there!Zumanity definitely brought the Cirque du Soleil standard DOWN a few notches - and I don't say this from some type of closed-minded/neo-conservative point of view.  When I think "Cirque" I think flips and dangerous stunts, instead, you get a couple real acrobats and a bunch of crappy SNL sketch comedy.  

The only real thing I enjoyed about Zumanity was the guitarist in the pit-crew/band.  This chick could rock, they should just do the show where she rocks out on her Fender.Nice suite, in Venezia tower. 18th floor with a nice view of strip. I prefer Palazzo over Venetian. No coffee maker in room, boo. No sectional, in suite, another boo. A sectional, like at the Palazzo, is much better than the sofa bed w/ two chairs. Got a free coupon for coffee upon checkin. In order to redeem it the coffee shop is clear on other side of hotel & it's the smallest coffee I've ever seen!! So not worth the trek. The bathrm is a great size. Really large shower. I had some leftover food from a restaurant, asked at front desk if I could warm it in a microwave some place. I was told NO, there was nowhere. Also, the ice maker for the floor was in a whole other wing, very far from room.This is not 5 star service & I was somewhat inconvenienced. At a nightly rate of $350+, there should be no inconvenience.The best thing about this hotel was that it was comped! YES!! but the bad thing is that... they lied to my friends mom telling her that they will give her tickets to the Pacquiao fight and on the day of her picking up the tickets, they told her it was the close circuit fight not the actual fight.. the boys were BUMPED.. but they had vip tickets to close circuit fight and they said it was fun watching it there. They got free drinks and food, and got to sit with Joe Jackson. haha. 

One thing that REALLY bugged me was that... their toilet handle was broken! I was having a hard time flushing the toilet... its twice as hard when you're really tired and drunk. I wanted to complain and get a new room, but everyone was okay with it so I didnt want to be the one comaplining. The bed was comfortable.. but the room was pretty small for me. Ever since my stay at the Palazzo, I just cant go back!!  It was just sooo spacious and nice there! and the environment is so much more fun and so much bigger. Mirage is just too small for me... but the nice thing is that its right on the strip so you;re so close to everything and can walk everywhere! but I wouldnt pay to stay here.It's the Mirage.  Not the level it once was, back in the day, but still a decent place to hang out.We weren't really impressed. At our table we had the sea bass, lamb chops and new york steak and we were not impressed with the quality of food.

Nothing really bad with it we have just had much better quality of food for the price elsewhere. 

I would suggest if your willing to pay 400 or 500 on a meal you try somewhere else like maybe the N9NE Steak House at the Palms or something.I usually go to MGM Grand quite often when I find myself in Vegas.  Not for the overpriced food and definitely not to get to see the lions that rarely ever come out from their little habitat there.  It's to take money from the tourists on the poker tables.

MGM opened their new poker room about a few years back (I was there) and it's probably one of the nicer rooms IMHO.  For starters, the room is right in the smack dab middle of the hotel and is quite spacious and roomy.  The tables are spread out enough so that you don't feel like sardines like you do over at the Bellagio poker room.  On popular club nights, you can check out the hot ladies all dolled up walking to Studio 54 which is the hotel's club.  But most importantly for some reason, a lot of fish tend to throw their money away at the MGM and I've been there many a time to catch them.  

As far as restaurants go, there are quite a few places to go within the MGM. Wolfgang pucks, Wichcraft, Diego's for fine dine Mexican and the list goes on and on.  There's even a food court if you feel like a quick slice of pizza of Mickie D's and of course there's the buffet, but theirs is nothing to write home about.

The hotel casino hotel over all is decent but I consider it 2nd tier to all the nicer ones like the Venetian, Bellagio and the Wynn for example.  Still that doesn't mean I don't stay here once in awhile when they send me free rooms in the mail.

Van The Man's Must Do : Watch Cirque De Solei "KA"We had a mini winter vacation in Las Vegas right after new year.  We decided to stay at MGM Grand Las Vegas because we found a great deal.  The rate is only $51 per night, and they even offered $100 dining credit at the new Aria in the City Center!  It was like staying at the hotel for free!

We left Los Angeles around 2pm and arrived at the hotel around 6:30pm.  They still had the Christmas decoration with the famous lion in the lobby.  The hotel and casino was a bit empty, but it was a Sunday night.

Our room is on the 17th floor.  A king sized bed took up most of the space in the room.  Initially we thought the room was nice when we first arrived.  But then we found out the pillows were really uncomfortable.  It was hard, stiff, with lumps of things inside, and the fabric made Dr. P's face itched.  I woke up with stiff neck and soar shoulders.  And the room was noisy.  I could hear people talking and walking up and down the hallway in the middle of the night.  In the morning we were awaken by the vacuum noise from the housekeeping staffs working in the hallway.

A simple desk and a cabinet with a small TV inside.  I like that they have Taiwanese CTI-TV channel.  

The wall was decorated with old photos of movie stars.  Some pictures were nice, but I personally don't like the ones that having the people in the photos starring at me.

Bathroom was pretty spacious.  On one side is the standard sink. On the other side is a small bathtub with shower head. Ok.... I don't like their toilet seat.  It felt really cold and hard... just uncomfortable.  And I dislike their toilet paper even more.  It was single ply and had very rough texture.  Fine, I have baby soft butt and I NEED soft and smooth toilet paper.  Is that too much to ask?  haha....

This was the view from our room.  We could see Hooters Casino across the street, and Mandalay Bay in the distance.

MGM is a nice casino, but I don't think it's a nice hotel.  I really don't need too much for a hotel room because I only go to the room to sleep and use the bathroom.  All I need is a comfortable bed and a comfortable bathroom, and MGM Grand lacks both.  I was happy that we got a really good deal on the room with the free dining credit, but I probably won't stay at MGM Grand again.This is probably a 3.5 star review, but I can't go up to 4.  We stayed at MGM during the first weekend of the NCAA tournament, so it was way crowded.  This is to be expected.  However, what was not expected was MGM doing work on the 24 hour coffee shop, which is typically the best (and at least most reliable) place to get breakfast in a casino.  It was poor planning to have this construction going on during one of the busiest Vegas weekends.  So, that was annoying.

The rooms are solid but not spectacular.  One thing that's nice about MGM Grand is there is a broad spectrum of things to eat, from a food court to Joel Robuchon.  Craftsteak is always a winner in my experience.  You have a good amount of dining options here.

I've been to several concerts at the Grand Garden Arena.  They do a great job of getting you in and out quickly.  

Front desk staff is very courteous, as is the MLife staff.  Dealers as well.  Very solid hotel all around.Located in Bally's, this place has decent sushi but nothing really to write home about.  Had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon.  Sushi is always good hangover food for me.  

Had a rainbow roll, spicy yellowtail roll and some salmon nigiri, all for around 36 dollars.  Little more than what I would expect to pay, but the quality was decent enough.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but at the time it seemed better than Nathan's or Sbarro.Great place for a tourist to go to in vegas if they want to be able to boast that they hung out in a vegas dive bar. While there is an anything can happen atmosphere here, if you are a vegas local, then you know that town is littered with 100's of scarier, less safe and more depressing dive bars than this. That being said, I have seen a motorcycle in the barroom doing a hole-shot and occassionally theres a fistfight outside. Overall a fun place where bikers, college kids and sunburned tourists saddle up elbow to elbow for drinks and bartop video poker. For scarier and truly interesting dive var crawls head downtownGood for the price. 
This hotel is okay. Clean, friendly, and has all the amenities needed. Also, has an empty small refrigerator in the rooms for use (some 5 star hotels don't have this which is a plus). Also, Wifi comes with room, no limit on # of users like Planet Hollywood. 
I would stay here again. 
The only problem is if you mind the smell of smoke, you wouldn't like to walk through the casino. While most casino allow smoking, somehow the smell of smoke is more potent in this casino. Other than that everything was A-OK.Mon Ami Gabi sits right on the strip and you can either sit outside and people watch or inside and stay cool. I highly recommend the people watching section. I specifically came here for Saturday brunch to get the corned beef hash. I had really high hopes for it, but it just didn't do anything for me. They had huge chunks of dry and chewy corned beef barely mixed in with potatoes. The poached eggs were perfect, and the hash browns were crisp just the way I like it. I would still recommend this place because it sits right across the Bellagio Fountains and you get a great show.

www.anitaeat.comMon Ami Gabi has one of the best locations on the strip - right in front of the Paris, with a gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountains.  Unfortunately, they don't take reservations for patio seating and the wait can get pretty long.  We gave up and opted to sit inside as a result.

In terms of the food, I'd recommend the escargot, French onion soup, and duck confit.  I'd suggest skipping the pate.  Overall, food was OK, but definitely a bit overboard in sodium content.  Most of the dishes were great for the first few bites, but quickly became too rich / too salty.  

Indoor seating is also extremely dark / stuffy (perhaps an interior remodel, additional lights, new furniture, etc. would help).  Overall, it's a nice place to eat if you're here for the view and manage to snag an outdoor table, but I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way to come back.3.5 stars

I ordered a cup of onion soup and the Salmon and my boyfriend ordered the steak with bordelaise sauce. The portions were very big but the food itself was not amazing. It reminded me of typical food you could get from a chain restaurant, but it was in no way bad. I love how the restaurant is right in front of the Bellagio hotel so you get a great view of the water show every 15 minutes. The restaurant is also very dimly lit and romantic. The .5 stars off was mainly for the slow service.I don't know. I would call the place mediocre. Definitely not more than 3 stars. We had to ask 2 times for a straw. Than they told us that the chicken pate was not available. My co worker received the onion soup 10 minutes before my appetizer finally made it. I just was able to speed up enough and finish my last bite before the main course arrived. The fries were way too salty. They waiter never asked how we like the food or if I would like to have another beer. They really try to rush you in order to make place for the next guest. Not a very enjoyable dinner. They won't see me again. There are way better choices around.I go to this restaurant maybe once every 4 months with my grand father (he likes this restaurant) and it gets worse and worse every time I go there. 
But service is great.

Go there if you win some $$$ there, otherwise I am pretty sure there are more excellent french restaurants in VegasChill spot if you wanna get away from the BIG club scene. Got in for free and there was no dress code. Place is a bit small.

DJ played hip-hop at first then changed to rave music. No thanks.

I would have gave an extra star if they played hip-hop all night.My boyfriend and I stayed at the Sahara last September and we had a nice stay. Sure it isn't as glamorous as other hotels on the strip but it definitely exceeded my expectations. My boyfriend picked it because of the pool. I read several reviews before going and I was definitely nervous but the Sahara was good enough. For a hotel I require, safe, clean and warm and the Sahara was definitely that. The decor is a little work and out of fashion and the hotel definitely doesn't have the brand new car smell. If you're looking for a clean, safe place to crash while youre out and about at the nicer hotels then stay here. The staff were definitely friendly and the pool was nice. Most of the guest are older but I wasn't trying to party with the guests anyway. Book a room here and enjoy yourself in the casinos of other hotels.

Don't eat the buffet here, no matter how cheap it is. It isn't worth it.This was the third time I'd been to Peppermill, and believe it to be a nice novelty.

I'm not sure who did, and why they did decorate the place in purple, lilac, and neon.  I know it is Vegas, but....what?  Also the waitresses are like over 40 hooters retirees.  But then why to analyze too much..it's Vegas.  Check out the bar in the back (yeah its kinda like a surreal Denny's with a bar in the back) there is a fire pit/place.

Worth a visit.  The food is good.  Some items slightly rich.  I've so far had a few different versions of their Eggs Benedict.  This last one was a Steak Benedict.  It was ok, next time I'll take the ham.

DafeMirrored ceilings, artificial trees "in bloom", Tiffany style lamps with pink flamingos, and artificial plants everywhere else... oh my, this is gonna be interesting was my first thought after walking into the restaurant.  After being seated at my table, I'm asked if I would like something from the bar. Hummm. It's 5pm somewhere, but in Vegas ist 9am... Oh wait, clocks don't work very well here in the desert... Bring me an Irish coffee!!

The omelette was very, very big... too big for me to finish.  Full of flavor including the home made breakfast potatoes.  The service was quite prompts, even when a friend stopped in to join me at the last minute.   My tummy was very content after leaving and hitting the shops later.  This is on the strip, but not in the popular area.  For us, it was a good choice being fairly close to the Stratosphere.  Price wise, its not a steal of a deal, but it was good and very filling... worthy of another visit when Im in town.Stayed here for 1 night only. IMO, the rooms are a-ok for the price. I wouldn't mind staying here again. I wish the bathroom were bigger though.I remember thinking how cool the Luxor looked when it opened in the early 1990's and that it would really be cool to stay here. Well, I think I got over that once my lobotomy kicked in because the place is definitely frayed on the edges now. Now don't get me wrong. I don't think it's at the beer-guzzling, Larry-the-Cable-Guy level of the Excalibur, but it's still no Mandalay Bay. It's in that in-between land of kitsch and klassy, somehow not quite making up its mind what it is. 

Even though the black pyramid still has that sleek look about it, there are tell-tale signs of trashiness like having Carrot Top as their permanent comedy attraction. The rooms are average with some faux-Egyptian touches thrown in on the bedspreads and the TV cabinet, but for $80 per night, who am I to complain? Well, truth be told, the ice machine was broken and what really blew was the elevator, you should pardon the expression. Because it aligns with the contours of the pyramid, it goes up diagonally, and your stomach does a downshift when it moves. I can well imagine finding yourself on your knees as it jerks upward and not because you're glad to see me. 

The parking garage is quite a trek probably because they didn't have cars in Cleopatra's time, just barges. Speaking of which, they don't have the Nile River cruise surrounding the casino anymore. I guess the owners must have thought it looked cheesy compared to the canal in the Venetian. Yeah, like having a "Do Not Disturb" door hanger featuring Carrot Top is not cheesy. Having just visited the sleek and antiseptic Aria in the new City Center, I kinda missed the cheese. I say you could do worse than the Luxor.This is the shit! looks like shit!!! oh yeah!!!Over my last ten visits to Las Vegas, I have stayed at the Luxor four of those times. I have personally stayed at many other upscale hotels in Las Vegas, but for an honest and reasonable price, the Luxor is where its at.

The Luxor provides the whole Vegas feel, with their iconic structure and design, and like I said, for a very reasonable price. The few disadvantages are that its more towards the beginning of the strip, so a little walking will be done to get more into the middle of the strip, but the connections to the Excalibur and New York New York, make it a little easier to get ahead on the Strip. I'd say this hotel is very kid friendly and also provides a fairly big casino.

The Luxor is also home to ( believe it or not ) probably the best or one of the best shows i've seen in Vegas. I have to admit I was very skeptical but after reading the reviews I had to give it a try, and it did not disappoint one bit. Hilarious show, its a must see.

I also enjoy the Luxor's pool area. Very classic Egyptian feel to it, almost like an Oasis of endless water. Club LAX is also one of the nicer clubs I have been to in Vegas, and i've been to some very trashy ones before.

Overall, great place. They can add a little more excitement to the Casino floor, maybe more music, party atmosphere going on but other than that, good job.Has: A tram to get you to Excalibur or Luxor
Has Not: A tram to get you to anywhere cool people might stay

Has: Fleur de Lys
Has Not: Reservations available during your trip

Has Not: Competent staff who can get you from point A to point B quicklyWow, they actually care about their guests.  Because of the yelp review, they contacted me and straightened out the whole buffet credit issue.  Cool!  I'm pretty happy with the experience now, haha.  After that, I really have nothing bad to say about them.  I'd keep them as an option the next time I'm going to Light (which, by the way, is an amazing club: both the nightclub and the day pool party).Liked it over all. the mash potatoes are incredible and the steak is of course very good! Overall its a good steakhouse but nothing too amazing!We were in Vegas for 3 days and I wanted to try a really good steakhouse. I told my husband I wanted to go to Craftsteak for dinner and made reservations. We showed up 15mins early and was seated right on time of our reservation. The service was great and very helpful. The food was excellent and cooked perfectly! The only complaint is why do you have to be located in the MGM?? It's doesn't help when your trying to have a nice dinner when you have two guys and a girl next to us and one of the guys was passed out! Oh and on the way out I had to use the restroom and two girls were puking! Kinda spoiled my nice dinner! Next time I'll stick to Del Frisco's or stripsteak where it is more classier.3.5 stars

I don't want to write a book about the place, I just want to cover some bases so you are prepared to dine here. It's dark inside. Not romantic dark, but oddly too dark. 

After reading a lot of reviews and seeking suggestions from the Yelp community, it was strongly suggested that we go for the tasting menu. We chose the Domestic Wagyu beef tasting at $140/person. A bit expensive of course, but we wanted to splurge so we did it despite our better judgement. 

First of all, if this is the route you plan to take, please make sure you arrive with an empty stomach. The portion sizes would make Mr. Buca Di Beppo blush. 

As part of the tasting, you are allowed (I say allowed b/c the chef is rather particular about what and how you order) to order appetizers, salads, two steak options, of which you cannot order the same cut and a dessert accompaniment. Yes, that much food!!

Cow:

The steaks were prepared medium and arrived a little closer to medium rare. I am fine with it, but my lady doesn't like it too rare. I mean, could we send it back? Of course. But it would be nice if they just follow what's ordered. 

Sides: 

Potato Gratin was ok. I hate this dish simply b/c made at home or at a high end restaurant, it doesn't matter. Once you cut into it you either need to eat every bite within moments or deal with the fact that it solidifies quickly and no longer tastes the way it should. Mushrooms were a huge hit, for me at least. Roasted, seasoned well and delicious!! Baby carrots were, well baby carrots. 

Dessert:

Selections were incredible! Choco indulgence was my second fave. Chocolate mousse covered with chocolate ganache and served with house made chocolate ice cream. However, this took a back seat to their Monkeybread. Easily the most delicious dessert I've tasted, possibly ever. Sticky, gooey, caramel and nuts slathered over warm, soft and delicious monkeybread. Wow!!Great food...what else can you say about top chef, tom colicchio...service was out if this world...our waiter Marvin had a slick, smooth way about him that spelled class. We had the kobe tasting menu and holy smokes that wagyu beef is amazing...so much flavor and tenderness....off the charts...sides were awesome and the bread...OMG!!!!!!i didnt know what rating to give. its a toss up or should i say -- its a crap shoot. hahha
1.chips and salsa - good
2. vegan salad and rolled tacos - good
3. beer and tequila - goooood
4. is where i have a problem - seeing guys from AFI ? does pink taco get another star cause we seen those guys?? - good??
5. eating pink taco 2 days in a row - not good!!! unless you need to "cleanse" if you know what i mean.This specific outlet has better stores than the one on the south side of the strip and has the out door shopping environment which I like. I know they are working on the parking garage but it seems that there is always a back up when it comes to parking and you are sitting in traffic for what seems like forever. I also feel the human beings act differently Not sure why but i had some "strange" experiences with some travelers here.my friends and i got in for free, so that was a good start. they played good songs on the piano and they were very into it! i had fun here, but it's only a bar, so i'm giving it only 3 stars =)Every time we are around this area for a concert, or event, the first place we think about is Mr. Lucky's for their $9.99 all you can eat prime rib special. The first cut is always large, served with mashed potatoes, and a side of steamed veggies. The veggies are good enough to ask for seconds, but that is not part of the deal. After the first plate, you will begin to receive slimmer cuts of meat by itself. Truth be told, I am stuffed on the first serving alone, but I usually go for seconds to pretend like I'm getting my moneys worth. 

The rest of the menu is over priced. Some friends will order burgers or corn beef hash, but I can never get myself to do so. Most of the time they seem less than thrilled with their orders which makes me want to veer off less. 

The last time I went, the service was not satisfactory. Our server barely paid attention to us, probably because five out of seven of us ordered the special. Our drinks were not refilled in a timely manner, and everyone else around us looked to be higher priority. There have been times where we have received excellent service, but it seems hit or miss. Still a party of 7 with specials will get the bill to $70. If you provide good service, you will get a $14 tip. That is not something to frown upon.The trusty Yelp app has, yet again(points upo with finger), helped me find some good food, in a hurry. GJ Yelp :) 

My wife and I had just gotten out of an MMA competition and were STARVING! Of course, I jumped on the Yelp app, which lead us to "Mr. Luckys". I glanced through some "Tips" and saw that they have a $7.77 gamblers deal, which was off the menu, and sounded great. After we were seated, our waitress came over, took our drink order and asked if we had any questions. She told me I had to have a players "Backstage Pass" to get the $7.77 deal, and directed me towards the players reward desk. She was nice enough to put the order in while I went and picked up my card. 

My wife and I ordered the "Chicken Nachos"(refer to pic) to start. They were good. The cheese, which was smothered throughout, was gooey, deliciousness. The nachos weren't amazing, but they were very good and they were served on a hot skillet. Pretty cool presentation for sure. The $7.77 special(refer to pic) came with a salad, (looked like) 8oz Strip Steak topped with 3 grilled shrimp, and mashed potatoes. It was rather large for the price, and extremely tasty as well. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium. It was very juicy and flavorful. The shrimp, on the othe hand, were rubbery, and I actually forgot they were on the plate until I looked back at the picture I took. My wife ordered a bacon cheese burger, which she thought was good, but nothing special. 

The restaurant started to become packed, so we didn't want to keep the booth occupied for any longer. The waitress, even though she was noticeably busy, was still on point, and got us out the door in no time. The only thing I noticed while enjoying my meal was, all the servers, and food runners were not happy, and walked around like they were the s#%$. I know, I was in the "Hard Rock Hotel", but at least look a little happy when all these guests, including my wife and I, are putting $$$ in your pockets. Other than a bit of pretentious attitudes(not from our server), the place was good.Mimosas!!!!
Any place that serves mimosas is A-OK in my book.  We stopped in this place while waiting for a table at a neighboring restaurant.  We'd been in here a few times before and it seems to be pretty consistent in good booze and slightly lack-luster service.  Not that the girls are rude, I just think they need a hostess because the place is huge and it's all seat yourself and the girls are attempting to rotate tables.
We ended up getting only one round because we never got revisited until we had to stop someone for our check.
This place has a good thing going, but just needs a better system to simplify the service and make sure everyone is taken care of.I've been here a couple of times, and it isn't bad, but I really have found nothing great here that can't be found elsewhere in Madison. The burgers are ok, but Amy's and Dotty's both are better at making burgers. The drink selection I remember being decent, but nothing special. That's pretty much all I have to say about the Nitty Gritty.I was stuck in my hotel room at Caesar's Palace alone and decided to check out "the best nightclub in Vegas." There was a ridiculously long line and then the VIP line (which had about 5 people in it). I didn't have any VIP pass of any kind, but they just let me in anyway.

The bars were too crowded to get a drink. The area for bottle service was tiny, and it was so packed that you could barely move. I was there on a weekend, so maybe my experience would have been better on some random Tuesday night (or if I showed up earlier with friends and got bottle service).

A lot of times, I go to clubs and it's the same music over and over again with mediocre DJs. The DJ playing that night was actually fantastic, but as I mentioned before, the place was so packed lke LA traffic, I couldn't really dance.

I had a couple of random guys who tried to touch me uninvited, but a couple of nice guys too. With how packed it was, it was pretty difficult to socialize. The interior was beautiful, and the dance floor was brightly lit, which I liked. 

Although there were good qualities about the club, it pretty much got canceled out by the amount of people there, so it ended up just being okay. I ended leaving the club not long after I arrived, and went to a nice lounge in the hotel.Once upon a time in a city of sins, there exist a glowing palace called PURE.  ** I let out a big guffaw as I wrote this wondrous oxymoron **

There was a time when this was THE place in Vegas for clubbing. All the celebs go here, the celeb djs spin here, the hot ladies of PussyCatDolls have a regular gig here. PURE was the ish.

I never had issues with lines or any of that bouncer issues, since a group of girls always gets free VIP passes and skips the line. Bouncer was friendly to us and everyone had fun getting down on the big dance floor where the late dj Adam Goldstein did his shit (yea it was that long ago)

No longer is this the IT club so I'm not sure what has changed but when in Vegas, I'd hit up Marquee or Tryst or Surrender.

Maybe one would hit up PURE to cleanse their dirty & sinful souls?You really have to be in the mood for this place.  And if you are in the mood, be prepared to face a monster bill.  

I've been here 4 times, and every time the main hall has been super noisy.  Partly because of the band and partly because of the general rowdiness.  The beer garden is much more subdued, but kind of defeats the point.  

Usually I only come here for going away parties or because out of towners want to celebrate all that is Vegas.  In my experience, the servers really push the large beers and shots, with spankings, which are about $7 a piece.  Let me explain.

A shot girl, or your server if you prefer, will bring you a shot of apple schnapps or Jager on a paddle.  You drink the shot and then they hit you in the ass with the paddle a few times.  

It's actually more organized than you would think.  The servers have always been meticulous about how the "patron" bends over to take their spanking, arm position, no wallets, etc. So, if the person is drunk, it takes a good five minutes to get them in the right position to get them spanked.  Usually about three spankings are given, but I've seen them do more if they don't think they hit you hard enough.  If everyone is in a fun-loving and/or abusive mood, then the spankings will add up (and the tips given to the spankers) pretty quickly.

Lots of songs, lots of singing, lots of stein holding contests and beer chugging contests.  Things can get ugly fast.  The restrooms are small, which seems incompatible with the excessive alcohol consumption encouraged, but I haven't seen any mishaps either. 

Food is ok.  We usually get the giant pretzels with cheese whiz.  Nothing special. 

Gratuity is always added onto the bill.  It's pretty obvious on the bill and the servers have always let us know, but that's something to remember in case your party is too drunk to listen or read.  Only go here if you are in a good mood and ready to have a good time.  Poopy pants will ruin it for everyone.Headline: Nothing Special

The headline pretty much sums up my visit. Neither the food, the service, nor the location were anything special.

I had the delux burger, which on paper should be a real winner. Unfortunately it turned out to be a big pile of *meh*.. Same with the fries.

The beer selection is decent with a few local brews that I haven't seen elsewhere.

I wouldn't mind giving it another try if I'm in the area again, but it seems like there are some better options pretty close by.Eh, just okay. It was crowded and not as clean as we'd like to see. Food was mediocre. Glad we did it, but probably won't go back.It was okay. I liked the emerald chicken with the ginger sauce very fresh. The red jade pork has given me heart burn and too much spice in the jerk rice to enjoy. Willing to go back and try something else if I'm in the area.I was a newbie to the Las Vegas buffet scene so I thought I'd go big. There was certainly plenty of food to choose, all in general pretty high quality for a buffet. I really liked the prime rib, but the crab wasn't all that great. Even though the line outside looked daunting it moved quickly and my party of 10 were seated promptly. The interior is noting special, pretty disappointing, actually. I assumed some of that high price went to having a nice ambiance, but it was pretty plain (I hear the wynn is nice). Overall, I was happy I had come, although I probably will not make a return visit next time I'm in Vegas.. $40 was a little too steep for me. In the end I eat so much I feel like ish anyhow, no matter how good the food is.After the advice of many, decided to come here around 3pm since the line can be up to an hour.  That way, you pay the lunch price but can still linger around for dinner food ;)  Well, the line took just 15 minutes, so we were stuck with the lunch stuff for 45 minutes, and that was not impressive at all.  I kid you not.  Think one level above Hometown Buffet.

But then...the dinner stuff came out, and that was great.  Crab legs already cracked for you!  All the good sushi!

The creme brulee alone was a reason for me to come back though.  I think it might possibly be the best dessert I have ever tasted.

But that was it.  I was expecting so much more.  It's the BELLAGIO, you know?  And so many people rave about it on Yelp and other sites.  I wish I could give it a higher rating but I just can't.My husband and I got free buffets here with a show. Well the only thing I was impressed about was the crablegs were steamed and hot, unlike the other buffets in Vegas. My husband had a few good items. The cupcakes were awesome though, this is why it got 3 stars instead of 2The original Cirque Du Soleil was AWESOME and with every copy it goes down in quality a notch. Ugh. Fun amusing evening, but just...ok. Kinda like the Monte Carlo and Paris on the Strip, the originals are better.3 Stars because of the decor and being able to dance on top the stage in the main room.. haha.. but helllllllllllllllllllaaaa crowded no seating... can't walk.. the majority of the people are walking around... hated that... but if you got friends who work for TAO get them to get you into the club VIP because I honestly don't know the price to get into the club.I'm not a fan of Tao anymore.

The first time I went to Vegas after turning 21, it was definitely fun. Especially since it was my first Vegas club and we ended up getting bottle service and somehow we ended up getting bottles of Cristal. It was your typical Vegas experience. (Oh and I don't know WHY we got Cristal. When you're drunk, $10 champagne and $150 champagne tastes exactly the same.)

But besides that fun first time experience, there's nothing special about this club. It's hard to dance anywhere or try to walk around looking for your friends. If you want to go upstairs to Tao Beach, you have to stand in a line and then walk up 20000000 flights of stairs. (If you thought the stairs at Tryst was bad, this is W O R S E). 

If you've never gone to Tao, check it out once just to say you've gone but there really isn't a point of returning here. There's better clubs/lounges/bars to check out.I would actually give this place 3.5 stars.  I stayed at Palms recently and I came to Ghost bar 2 of the 3 nights I was there.  I went on Sunday night and Monday night, both nights were chill, but Sunday had a bit more people.  Both nights we went we got drinks and hung out in our spot on the outside terrace, the view was beautiful! The bartenders were nice and our mixed drinks were about 12$ each.  They have a spot on the terrace were u can look down 55 floors, but girls,  I wouldn't really recommend standing  directly on it unless u want everybody seeing your cellulite, cause let me tell u, that was our biggest convo of the evening...it even showcased the skinniest girls cellulite....and it did not look good!  But if u don't care about that then go ahead!!  Anyway, both nights we ended up meeting cute friendly men and having a great time! Ah, I love Las Vegas!!Id have to say it was pretty freakin boring... but really cool view of last vegas strip... not really a place where you can stay all night and have fun...Saw "O" with a couple of friends in April; we sat in section 102, Row H, seats 6-8.  Although we weren't "central" to the stage, we were still able to catch all the action.  My friends were blown away and absolutely loved "O", but I was less enthused.  I don't feel the show was worth the $175 price per ticket (tax included).  I guess I'm still spoiled by the spectacle and storyline associated with "KA" at the MGM Grand.  The music with "KA" is also more poignant and more relevant to the plot.  

I can certainly appreciate the talent that went into the performances and sets, but I expected more "acts".  Although the comedic acts by the two clowns were enjoyable at first, after the second act, it became repetitive...and annoying.  

I have seen "KA", "Zumanity", "Mystere", "Le Reve", and now "O", but so far, "KA" remains my all-time favorite cirque show.  Would I pay to see "O" again?  No.  With that said, everyone should experience this show at least once.  I think for those that haven't experienced a cirque show, it will be an enjoyable experience.  (I've seen "KA" twice and will pay to see it again.)

Try to get to the show at least 30 minutes before start-time.  You'll have the opportunity to grab a drink and get souvenir photos taken.  The photographer(s) that take photos of you will give you a ticket and by the end of the show, your photos will be ready for viewing as you exit the theater.  A set of two photos (5"x7") will cost you $45, but hey, they come with memories...and a nice souvenir "O" photo frame.This was the first CDS show I'd ever seen and we were honestly, well...underwhelmed.  So much so that I was falling asleep halfway through during the ship act.  I just found this whole show to move kind of slow and wasn't overly impressed.  We've since seen KA and Mystere and LOVED both.  I'd rank KA as #1, then Mystere, and O at the bottom of the pack.  Seeing La Reve this weekend and hoping it's better!Some really cool parts to this show. Just ad something missing, not sure what. I think it was the story line. It just did not pull me in to the show. Seats in 103 section were awesome and all the seats seemed good in the place.  Get you tickets at a discount because 135 bucks, is not worth it.I was SUPER excited to see the show because I've only heard incredible things. The show was great, but I feel like it ended abruptly. I believe they took out the last scene where they had the death earlier this year, which I completely understand, but the new ending did not transition well. I was able to get a really good price on the tickets with their anniversary sale, but I think I would have been really disappointed if I bought the tickets at full price.We have enjoyed this show twice in the past, but this was the first time since the show was revamped as a result of mid-2013 fatal accident by one of the performers.  In my opinion, the show is far less dramatic/acrobatic than in the past.  I actually became bored at one point.The good: the chicken on my spinach salad was real chicken, not that reprocessed chicken nonsense, and the pecans were freshly candied. The dried cranberries weren't plumped, but I'll give them a pass, because the rest of the salad was better than I was expecting from a diner.

The bad: the soup of the day was terrible. It was a mix of chopped and diced veggies in chicken stock. It tasted like they literally just tossed some veggies in with chicken stock, and some salt and pepper. That would have been bad enough, but, it wasn't even a proper dice; the chunks were all different sizes, so the small ones cooked faster and were soggy, and the large ones were undercooked.

The ugly: I live in such a food wasteland that I'll probably end up eating here again.the place to go for a decent meal in vegas. Ill go at least once every trip im there. Usually for breakfast brunch or lunch. They made my girlfriend something off the menu. We appreciated that. 

Ill be back there for sure.We have eaten here before but this last time was one of the worst experiences ever. Keep in mind it was not busy at this hour. We walked in and were greeted right away and quickly seated. After waiting 10 minutes someone casually dropped off 4 waters  but nothing else. At this point we had waited 15 minutes but still had no idea who our waiter was. We finally asked the lady in the front to be moved into another section and she quickly sat us somewhere else. After that we had to wait another 20 minutes for food and finally ate after what felt like forever. This was an awful experience and the manager came over and just apologized and walked away. He didn't say anything else, didn't ask us if we needed anything. It was  a very disappointing experience especially because we have eaten here many times before. On the bright side the food was good.The food we did get was good and the manager has since contacted us personally to apologize and send us something to make up for it.  I'll recommend this place now because I'm pretty sure it was a bad one-off situation and they do care about their customer's experience.Mediocre - neither here nor there.  

A Vietnamese grilled chicken sandwich and a European roast beef (both on baguette).  May give this place another try if I am bored with just about every type of sandwich shop in town, but otherwise, I doubt I'd re-visit.  The grilled chicken contained very sub-standard chicken "pieces" and wasn't very flavorful and the roast beef was almost too chewy and lacked flavor.  On the plus side, the baguette was authentic, fresh and delicious but that really isn't enough to carry the sandwich.Still sitting on the fence on this place, BUT the owner sent me a Yelp message and encouraged me to stop by and then do an update on my original review.

Kudos to him for reading Yelp reviews and listening to customers...we'll see what happens on my next visit.

But I give him credit for being involved and listening to yelpers.Everything was pretty good here- except for my entree.  Service, wine, atmosphere all raised my expectations for what turned out to be the worst osso bucco I have ever had in my life.  If you could actually buy this from a can, that is what my meal tasted like.  So I thought, well, focus on the risotto, and ignore the nasty gray meat in the middle of your plate.  Mistake!  It was really nasty also.  So, my one star meal was balanced my what seemed like good food at the rest of my table and good service= three stars.I didn't think the food was anything special but it's a great choice for a larger group, very middle-ground. 

It's a nice restuarant but not uber-fancy and the prices are reasonable. 

Have a shot of tequilla and relax.Garduno's started in Albuquerque and has had 3 locations in Las Vegas, the one at The Palms being the only decent one. They use the same basic recipes as the original ones in Nuevo Mexico and everything food wise is usuall pretty darned good. Their chips & salsa will always be my favorite and it's nice to get a green chili fix living here in Vegas. Ask for sopapillas at the end of your meal... free, puff pastry doughnut awesomeness covered with honey :)
My reasoning for 3 stars instead of more is the service is really hard to predict and so hit & miss it's ridiculous. After eating here at least a dozen times I would highly recommend going there for lunch and avoiding the absolute BS worst service ever that the night staff provides. I've complained to several managers about food & service and they don't give a shit either so if service starts going down hill just get up & leave. If the service is good you know what to do.
We will continue to go back cause my wife loves the huge chicken/mexican salad and I slurp down a ton of chips & salsa and tend to enjoy the outdoor patio by the pool with a cold beer. Give it a shot as occasionally the food & service both kick ass and that's what keeps us going back.Can't say I enjoyed the food here much. Maybe it was the pizza I got (the vegetarian) but my friends didn't think to highly of the Pizza's they had gotten either. I was impressed by the ambience of the restaurant and the overall presentation. But the pizza itself was not great at all. It's definitely no where near the taste of Bianco's and I was hoping this place would be a good alternative.  My friends go here a lot for lunch to get sandwiches. I may give that a try sometime but I would advise against coming here for dinner.

Instead grab dinner somewhere else and come here and grab a nutella & banana crepe for dessert! Now that was good.I really wanted to give Fez four stars as well but our customer service was lacking as mentioned in other reviews. The food was very good and everyone seemed to enjoy what they ordered in my party. I liked the lamb slider to start off and would recommend it. My brother ordered a Fez burger and I ordered the spicy grilled chicken sandwich. We ended up splitting meals and both were both a bit outside the box when it comes to ingredients but both tasted very very good. The cocktails are very good and they have a decent choice of brews and a good happy hour. The only thing missing from the equation was better service. We were asked if we knew what we wanted to order and asked for a minute only to not see our waiter for over 15 minutes. Our cups needed refills for most of the meal and we too had to flag someone down for simple needs. I would suggest this place to friends because the food defiantly triumphs the service.Good Food. Ok service.  First let me say we sat in the bar, because of my sister.  Not what I would have done.  Since i don't drink.  So since its a bar its very loud...  full of people drinking and running around..  Ok I know it supposed to be that way.  Las Vegas is for party people and drunks so if your in that group go now...  Otherwise go some where in Boulder City or not Vegas.We had a good, if somewhat overpriced meal at this restaurant. The service was very good, even considering we had a singing waiter who serenades the house a few times during our meal. I had chicken piccata, which was generously portioned. Others had steak and a pasta pesto dish, which both enjoyed. Waiters are savvy and will encourage items to increase your bill. In all an enjoyable meal at the lovely fake Paris.Was suggest this place by a previous local.
They don't take reservations - so keep that in mind.
They have a very cool aquarium in the floor when you walk in. Kinda creepy, but neat!
They have a number of very hot and very tall waitresses.
Ours was Erica. She rocked for the first half of the meal until we decided we wanted round 2 of sushi, then her attention waned and our wait time extended.

We started with miso soup and a las vegas roll on special - i didn't like the smolked salmon taste.

What i really loved was the Godzilla roll, and the lava roll!
The crunch roll was ok, not great, the egg was a little watery, the stingray roll was covered in dried cilantro and was simply weird.
A fun place over all. Not super crowded and not as loud as some people thought it would be.

The mochi for desert was weird, you didn't get to pick your flavors... hmmm.
And our waitress took enough time to bring us a knife and spoons that our mochi melted.... sigh.

I'd suggest knowing to only have 1 round of sushi so you get the good service!!in vegas, the growing world of all you can eat sushi restaurants mimics the rapid growth of vegas.  i yet have to find my favorite place.  i frequent this place a lot b/c of the proximity to the people i usually eat there with. 
i was disappointed my first time. they did not have an alcohol license at the time.  (I want to drink Sake and SAKE BOMBS, argghhh!!!!)  the service was awful.  the waiter kept reminding our group that all-u-can eat sushi had a time limit and that we had to finish all our orders, including the rice.  i was truly offended at the comments.  i came from Reno, where i still believe the concept of all-u-can eat sushi at the sushi bar began (this was about 16yrs ago...props to Sushi Teri).  We were also very hungry, it was not necessary to remind us.  i mean it's even written in the menu.  at that point my friend and i was pissed.  the two of us to start a mission to target one item on menu and make them run out of it.  we  targeted the mussels.  we kept ordering 4 orders of them (about 5 times).  it came to the point where our waiter kept avoiding our table and avoiding making eye contact with my friend and i.  i finally got him to return to the the table, so i can ask for some more.  he was apologetic to tell us that he can only give us 1 more order because they had no more left. ha..ha...ha  our mission was complete along with eating several orders of sushi, some tempura, some edamame, yellow tail collar, and some ice cream and mochi.  
the all-u-can-eat  menu is quite extensive.  they have several types of appetizers, nigiri, hand rolls, long rolls, and dessert items.  i haven't tried that many rolls b/c i just love nigiri and the rolls fill you up too fast .    im disappointed that they limit you to only 2 orders of ama-ebi and toro. i think their ama-ebi was crap anyway.  i don't think it's really sweet shrimp.  yeah, this is one of the better all-u-can eat sushi place in vegas, but i doubt it is the best.  so the search goes on....This place is VERY over-rated.  The interior of the place is really nice and the ambiance was excellent, at least where I was seated.  However, the food just wasn't all that.  For $34 a person I expected more than just dressed up food laid out all pretty on a plate.  Some of the food was excellent but for the most part it was just comparable to any other $20/person buffet.  I LOVE crab legs and I can eat them forever, but these crab legs were just a little on the too salty side.  Sadly, I couldn't eat too many of them because of this.  Stay far, far away from any sushi that you see here.  The pizza was crappy.  The creme brulee was pretty good though.  Basically, I think this place is too expensive for what you get.  I've had better buffets at places that are $10 bucks cheaper per person.First stop after arriving into Vegas at 10am last month. I've always admired their service, decor, and large variety of food (size, cuisine diversity, and overall spread). 

However, this visit fell short of par as the waitress would forget our drink orders (didn't you just write them down?), disappear for long stints and then reappear with an option I didn't ask for (tabasco when I kindly asked for cholula). 

We came as a large group and as a result had to wait a bit longer than other (smaller) parties to be seated, even though we had clearly mentioned and stated that we wouldn't mind separating. Minor annoyance, but at the end of the day it's all about attention to detail! 

I've only ever come for breakfast/lunch/brunch spread, and never for dinner so I have no hints to how the service/spread is then, but with the Wynn standards, I'm reassured that it trumps most of what the strip has to offer. 

Favorites (worth going back for seconds for) were: 
* Chinese Congee
* Green beans! 
* Dumplings 

Avoid the grapefruit, it's often dry =/

Coming back for more? 
If you're going to spend money for a buffet, you might as well spend it at the Wynn. It's the only hotel buffet destination where I know I won't get food poisoning!Pros:
+Outstanding dessert bar (has like 20 delicious items)
+Decent selection
+Vegan friendly food available
+Friendly service

Cons:
-Not much for vegetarians
-I expected more selection (eg: Italian pastas were missing, poor fruit selection) given the price (over 30 bucks a person for lunch)

Overall:
Good buffet but overpriced.Overall, it was better than the average buffets in Las Vegas but I was disappointed with the seafood selection. I was expecting a large variety of sushis and fish but they were very limited, maybe because it was the week after Memorial Day and the city was a little bit emptier. The prime rib was delicious though! I still remember how it tasty it was :) I must give a good credit for the dessert selection too.I'm giving this a 3 star because I'm ways kind of ehhh about buffets in general -- too much food and never worth the price tag for me, unless it's on a cruise :p. this buffet had a good variety of foods, there were a lot of vegetarian options but I wouldn't say that the options tasted that amazing and I think that's where my problem with buffets comes -- it's just a lot of average tasting food. Not to mention that since I'm vegetarian I end up feeling a little jipped since I can't try all the options. Nevertheless, the weekend brunch was only $35 so not too bad. Oh btw if you go with a larger party they add more fees which was irritating since we had a party of 15. The desserts are good :DIn designing The Buffet at The Wynn, Steve Wynn and his team have endeavored to convince us that we are classy people, dining in a classy establishment, and definitely not a bunch of gluttons shoveling calorie-rich platefuls of heterogenous cuisine into our faces. But, while the floral arrangements and pretty finishings typical of The Wynn are a nice touch, they shouldn't be fooling anyone. 

The Wynn Buffet is mainly about quantity. With 10-15 different food stations, running the gamut from Chinese congee to US comfort food, it definitely delivers on the core promise of any buffet. More importantly, though, The Wynn has managed to up the ante quality-wise, even if many of the individual dishes fail to perform when taken in isolation. The prime rib was good, as was maple-battered fried chicken, and the bakery is a sweet tooth's dream/diabetic's nightmare. We waited just over an hour for the Saturday brunch buffet. While fairly long, this seems to be pretty standard for Vegas buffets (and for popular brunch spots), and if you're particularly impatient you can pay an extra $15 to skip the line. 

On the downside, many of the individual items on offer aren't particularly tasty, and are basically an example of "quantity over quality." Spend your appetite wisely, and avoid average offerings like wood-fire pizza and the pancake & omelet stations. We also found the speed of service overly slow at times, as plates and utensils mounted up on the table before being cleared.3.5.  

For the Bellagio, this place is amazingly affordable even though my entire meal with a glass of wine and a bottle of pellegrino was $72.  By no means is that inexpensive but for Vegas and quite possibly the most expensive casino is Vegas, I'll take it.  

There was something for everyone here, which was the draw in the first place considering I was eating with extremely picky folks and my salmon dinner was pretty good, although I would have preferred a little pasta (which I filched from my coworker) with the white bean salad that accompanied my fish.

If I ever have to come to Vegas again (which I invariably do - twice in a month next year)  I'd consider the FIX again as a dining option.Excellent service and presentation. Spectacular view. Wine list mostly a rip off although there are a few pearls hidden.
Steak is mediocre and should be better from such a gorgeous high end restaurant (steaks tasted like choice not Prime in my opinion ). Not as good as last time I was here about 1 1/2 years ago.I've been here for hip-hop nights and electronic nights. It is assholes to elbows on hh nights. Getting from one side to the bathroom can be a horrible challenge.

Door is behind dj. So when you come in you are kinda right there in the business.

Upgraded speakers as of last Wednesday.I've been coming here for years and I believe the quality has been going down lately.  We never stay here, only on the strip and would make a trip just to eat their buffet.  The food is starting to taste like your typical buffet.  Nothing really special.  Same selection with subpar taste.  If you are a crab lover, then this is good for you since they serve both warm and cold carb legs.  Lines can be crazy so come early or late.Not the worst buffet, but -definitely- not the best. It's gotten more expensive as time passes, and for no reason. Because this buffet does not have the kind of quality anymore to be hiking prices up like that!

Ambiance: 3 - This buffet is always very clean at its stations and very organized. At the tables, not so much. Tables are rather scattered, disorganized and a bit dirty when you sit down. 

Service: 4 - Our server was very good and extremely funny. He really always took care of us, constantly refilling our drinks and even getting us extra plates when one of us ate some crabs or crawfish! 

Food: 2 - The only things really worth eating at this buffet was crab and dessert. But this time, even the crab legs were just sub-par, only having a little bit of meat inside. The rest of the food was just average--there's really nothing that I can say because, well, nothing really stood out!

Carnival used to be a better, cheaper buffet with bigger crab legs and with slightly better food! But now, going to Village Seafood Buffet is just a way, way better idea than spending that money at Carnival.Nice quiet little place to have breakfast or brunch. I wasn't too impressed with the egg halendaise. The price is a bit pricey for what the portions all.I journeyed off after on my quest to find a good breakfast spot. Decided to drive to Phx and give Matt's a try. 

Parking isn't easy. My super hero foresight made me move my car just in the nick of time! Sorry for the truck that got the ticket..
Anyhow not a big selection to choose from. I decided to have two eggs over easy, off the bone ham(extra$), hash browns, wheat bread, and a
Coffee..coffee was okay just coffee...not that I was expecting more..plate came up right away. Looked good. Ham was great! Would make a great sandwich with cheese. Eggs were eggs..Hash browns were good but I have a better idea...they were crunchy on outside and oily in the middle, it's bot bad just missing something...
I would NOT stand in a ridiculous line for this place....So for being featured on DDD, I expected a little more than what I got to be honest.  We arrived on a Sunday morning at 8:15 and waited a half hour, which I was fully expecting from the other reviews.  I was underwhelmed by the limited menu but understand that it has to be that way to turn the tables as fast as they need to in order to accommodate the crowd waiting outside.  My omelet was alright and my husband got the salami scramble which he did enjoy.  The sourdough toast, homemade jam and fragrant squeezed OJ was what I enjoyed the most.  I would recommend to visitors but honestly don't know if I would continue to come here and wait as a regular.Crappy parking.  Seriously, crappy parking.  Small lot, next to a car sales lot, you have to park in the neighborhood when things get busy.  That being said, you don't go there for the service, you go there for the fun.  For whatever reason, everytime a good group of folks go there, its like stepping into your own cheers.  The prices are average, the food is good, but the service is blah.  Somehow you don't care because you always have a good time listening to the tunes and having pints.Having seen KA first, I had high expectations for La Reve.  Long story short, KA blows La Reve out of the water.  

La Reve  was good, but not great.  I have seen La Reve twice.  Though the two shows are completely different, KA was hands down a much better show.  

I was offered a great deal for the show - 50% discount for Military/Federal Government, so it was worth it for the price.  The atmosphere in the theater is truly wonderful.  The theatre offers plush valour type seating - quite cozy.  I agree that there is not a bad seat in the house, so opt for the most economical tickets.  

La Reve offers strong acrobatics, serene water diving, and an interesting plot.  Undoubtedly, the best theatre show seating in Las Vegas.  However, I've seen better.I liked the feeling of the place.  I liked the vibe I got from the servers.  But I would have liked to see them a bit more.  

I liked my sandwich and the orzo salad was interesting.  The hummus wasn't anything more than "fine", though the pita pieces were so good I could have just eaten those as they had more overall flavor than the hummus.

The Lemonade almost made up for everything.  It was SO good!  But our glasses, and the glasses of most folks around us were empty almost more than they were full.  

In the end, it's good.  It's an amazing neighborhood spot in a place with fairly limited options.  I love that they can make just about anything vegan without tons of special ordering involved.  I may go again, sometime when I'm not as hungry and definitely not so thirsty.Bloom wasn't the best. But it wasn't the worst. I had a butternut squash tortellini with bacon and my girl got the miso cod. Both were good, but nothing too special. I feel like a lot of the Fox Concepts restaurants are too similar. Dim lighting. Similar food. I went to Olive and Ivy the week before and wasn't thrilled with my dinner dishes either.Good chips and salsa, like that they give you 3 different salsas. Both their beans are vegetarian, awesome. I recommend the black bean and cheese burrito enchilada style. Some people like the outdoor seating but the smell of the duck pond is pretty sick.Located inside the Hotel Valley Ho, this small restaurant is a pretty cool joint to grab some breakfast.  We've come here several times.  We enjoy the following items:

Eggs Benedict, $12

There's something about the decor of this place which I would describe as "retro cool".  Service is so/so, but generally good most of the time.

Return Factor - 75%The girlfriend and I decided to get the 24 hour pass for the buffets of buffets. Surprisingly this buffet was not bad.

The food was good and the place was clean. However, some stations the food seemed like it was sitting there for a few hours. 

I would recommend for lunch or a quick snack.I would gladly give this place another star, but I just can't bring myself. 

The drinks here are delicious, just to die for. I usually never drink the sweet cocktails, a simple martini is all I need, but it was my hubby's first time here, so we decided to try what they had to offer. I can't remember the name, but it had caramel in it and it was fantastic.

However, after a few drinks, Frank ordered a beer, Guinness to be exact, and since they did not serve it on tap, he settled for a bottle. When the bill came, my jaw dropped. I expect to pay $15 or even more for some cocktails here. After all this is the Bellagio. But to charge $11 for a bottle of Guinness? I was flabbergasted. Shame, 'cause I really liked that place.Not as much selection as my favorite buffets like the Rio and M Resort.  Really, the only thing that stands out to me is that they offer fresh made crepes.  And the line is always long here.  This place is included in that 24 hour unlimited buffet deal for $40.Based on what you are getting for the price, it's definitely not worth it, but due to the limited selection of Asian cuisine in Las Vegas, this will do...for now.

At the convenience of being inside Venetian, I really can't complain, but $13 for a bowl of beef porridge is a little ridiculous. I must admit, from the menu items I have tried, they are all pretty decent except for the soup, especially the Egg Flower Soup. The soup tasted worse than the imitation Egg Flower Soup at a Chinese buffet. I was a big fan of the Sze-Chuan Beef Noodle and the Ba Bao noodles though, just not the price tag. But again, we are in Vegas, so I can't really complain. 

For the most part, Noodle Asia satisfies my craving for Asian noodles while in Vegas, especially after a night of partying, and I am thankful for it's existence.Wow - seems like a lot of disgruntled diners have eaten here judging by all the negative reviews. Sure, it's not the best casino spot to eat in Vegas, but all the times I have been here it has not been all that bad. I was just here last month during a business trip and had a decent late night meal.

Basically, it is a glorified faux Parisian diner. You look up and around and see that you are sitting below a ceiling of blue skies, white fluffy clouds, and fake building fronts. I guess Le Cafe is trying to mimic the feel as if you are actually sitting in an outdoor cafe in Paris, enjoying a cappuccino while puffing away on a cigarette.

Sure, the service can be a bit "spotty" here and on the slow side, but it is open 24 hours and is a nice reprieve off the noisy casino floor. It's a decent enough place when you are craving a late night meal, breakfast, snack, or just want some coffee and a pastry. As with most casino eateries they can be a bit pricey and Le Cafe is no exception.

As a late night option when the clock is hitting midnight and most other restaurants are closed, or if you just don't feel like schlepping down the Las Vegas strip looking for a place to eat, Le Cafe is always there, open and available. Kind of like a Las Vegas "escort" hanging around the bar in a tight fitting dress and liquor on her breath.Not too bad. Buffet is huge, but cuisine is nothing too elaborate. Prime rib, pizza, mexican...as any buffet on a Friday night would be, it was jam packed.Ok, so, I'm one of the mid-day drunks who came here looking to sober up before heading to my afternoon nap in the hotel.  From what I do recall it was very good service, with plenty of water refills, and my entree was quite good.  Nice and clean place, and down to earth prices.  Great place to get some grease spoon food to soak up the alcohol.I feel bad giving this only 3 stars. Usually everything in Vegas is either 4 or 5 stars, and this was at the Bellagio!, but this place was eh. Good noodles but nothing special. I've had better noodles and Asian food elsewhere for much much cheaper. Definitely do not recommend. I feel like anyone who gives this place 5 stars has not tried REAL good noodles. Sorry...I ended up eating at Noodles twice while playing the Bellagio Cup poker tournament because it was close and looked inviting. 

It's a very casual place that caters to convenience of being right there and serves trendy and upscale Americanized Asian bistro. Of course, like most of these hotel restaurants, it prices itself way high and makes you think you're getting a better experience than you really are getting. The service is decent, not great, but decent. 

On my two visits, I ordered the Pad Thai noodles with pot sticker dim sum and Hor Fun with Satay Chicken. Being a Thai food aficionado, there was something a bit odd about the Pad Thai, almost a sickly sweet taste to it. The pot stickers were not exceptionally noteworthy. The Hor Fun was the best dish I ordered. The Satay Chicken was good, but it's pretty hard to screw that dish up.

I applaud them for giving correct portion sizes. They do not dump a truckload of food on a plate. It's a respectable serving size without making you feel like a glutton for finishing your bowl. The service was a bit sketchy. Not awful, but not great. My waitress just had the attitude of "what do you want to eat," not "can I answer any questions you might have?" 

Overpriced, yes. Underwhelming, no. If you find yourself in a pinch like I did, needing to grab a bite to eat while on a break, Noodles is a good choice. Otherwise, I'd stick to finding other real-deal restaurants in Vegas and steer clear.This place was pretty good. When we first walked in my initial thought was this isn't going to be a good dining experience cause it was so packed, but we got seated the server was on top of it.

i had the tasting menu and nothing really stood out to me where I could tell you how my experience was, but because our server was so excellent, i felt that they deserved 3 stars.Beautifully presented food and great service.  A nice assortment of cocktails and wine.  This hungry girl, however, is not a small plates kind of gal especially at Fleur's prices.

Dining with a large group (approx. 10) always tests the limits of good service at a restaurant and Fleur gets high marks for meeting the needs of our group.  We were all curious about the "get everything on the menu" option for $415 but there were too many of us that were queasy about one menu item or another.

Plates ordered included a cheese plate, skirt steak, kobe sliders, hummus, meatballs and lobster mac n cheese.  While the dishes looked good, I have to say that my unsophisticated palate just found everything to be "ok."  Everything was soooooooo tiny.  The sliders I could eat in just one bite.  The skirt steak at $22 gave me about four bites.  $72 later I was still starving and felt compelled to buy Oreos in the hotel gift shop (ok, I admit, that probably would have happened anyway).

If you have a large appetite like me then don't come here when you're really hungry. There is nothing here that would compel me to return unless I happen to be staying at the Mandalay Bay and want to grab a drink and a "snack."Smaller portions than you would expect but the food is pretty rich and flavorful.  I think of this spot as more of a snack before your real dinner.  I did enjoy the Manchego Salad and the Tuna Tacos (beware, they are bite size).  If you're concerned about your budget on an empty stomach, I would skip.Actually, 3.5 stars, but that's not possible. $50 restaurant.com coupon ($100 minimum spend) brought us her. I have been to Fleur de lys in SF and LOVED it - beautiful setting; beautiful experience. This place is drop-dead gorgeous. Aside: what's up with the painting of the partially be-headed Vegas bimbo? Was it ironic juxtaposition in such a "fancy" place? Not quite sure about that one... Anyway, space is pretty to look at, but the service is only so-so, and the food was a bit uneven in execution. Overall, this place was good, but not great. The food:

* Onion soup shooters - rich, creamy, sublime! No idea how they squeezed so much flavor out of something as simple and humble as an onion. Knock-out!
* Tuna taco - perfectly executed and delicious, but a bit of a let-down after the onion soup shooters. 
* Roasted duck - easily one of the best duck dishes I've ever had. The daikon accompanying it was expert and just under being "too" salty - perfection. Husband said it tasted like a teriyaki gummy bear, but that's another story...Loved it!
* Polenta w/ corn - rich, creamy, and the perfect foil for the duck.
* Wagyu burger - can we just call a time-out on the Kobe burgers? I'm officially over this over-priced, over-hyped menu item. Part of the problem was that it was on the wrong side of "medium" - overcooked and dry. Should have asked for medium rare, but shouldn't an attentive waiter gently corrected my husband when he asked for it medium? They have in the past. In any case, this was the main reason for the 3 instead of 4-star. Also, the "pomme frites" that seemed to be roasted fingerlings cut in half. Fine, but not pomme frites.
* Cheesecake - delicious and expertly plated. Nice way to end the evening.I'm a big fan of Hubert Keller. I really like his energy, his passion for food, and even had a great burger at his burger bar. I have to say this was a hit or miss for me. Let's start with the misses:

- I really was looking forward to the restaurant after looking at all the dishes on yelp. Turns out, they recently switched to a tapas concept. So, everything is smaller? 
-Also, turns out, the menu is divided into Italian, Spanish, Japanese, American and maybe one more country. I would think it be easier to do one cuisine really well. 
- I had a great paella before and thought, okay I'll try one dish from each region. I'll order the paella from Spain. It was a small tapas size but the entire dish was too salty.

Hits:
- the souffle was probably the most ordered dessert at the restaurant. It was delicious. The chocolate flavored dessert also comes with a beautiful scoop of pistachio ice cream. We also paired it with a two-scoop ice cream combo. We got MORE pistachio and blood orange. They both work with chocolate. 
-The seafood was delicious! From the yellowtail sashimi, the oysters over a bed of marbles and dry ice to the perfectly seared scallops. Wish they were entree sizes because I wanted more!
- the wait staff was quite attentive asking how everything was and if we wanted more of this or that
-the bread with the basic olive oil and balsamic blend was delicious. Simple is good. 

I hope they do have some entrees and mark it clearly on the menu. I'm fine with tapas but I was expecting a fuller meal before I found out about the changes. Also, there's only one unisex bathroom. It may take a while to get your foot through the door.Like everyone has said, not a great outlet but will do.  If you have limited time to shop while in Vegas I would suggest going to the North Outlet over this one.  If you're from the bay area its very much similar to the Great Mall but crappier.

The ONLY reason I would come here is for the Nike Outlet.  Skip everything else inside.Had breakfast here on a Saturday morning before hitting up the pool. Had a little bit of a wait to get seated but nothing that was not tolerable. The first thing I noticed was that Raffles was decorated nicely and we were seated at a spacious table. I hate when cafes have tiny tables and your chair ends up being bumped by others as you try to eat. 

I ordered biscuits and gravy for breakfast, cost was $9. My husband had pancakes which also came with eggs, bacon and sausage. I believe that was $12. I tried the bacon, it was nice and crunchy without being burnt, it made me wish I had gotten some as well. We also had yummy $12 mimosas. 

Service was fine, our waitress did nothing that stood out in a positive or negative fashion. Overall not a bad place to grab a breakfast if you are prepared to pay Strip prices.Came here at 4AM because it was the only thing open.

I got the "Super Nachos" and they were disgusting.  I wanted to vomit after I ate about 1/3.  My healthy friend got an egg-white omelette that she said was fine.  Points for them for having healthy options!  

This is just your average food place in Vegas that you come to when you need a quick fix.  Just avoid the nachos.Pastrami sandwich was great - just like NY.  The pickles were different.  Larger & not as tasty.  I also had a slice of carrot cake.  It was delicious.  Cake part was a little dry, but that frosting is wonderful - made the whole thing.  

Prices were crazy.  $35 for a sandwich, slice of cake & soda.I just saw the show tonight and I was hoping to give the show 5 stars after all that I read about it but sadly this is not the case.  We paid for VIP tickets (table 5 2nd row) but were treated anything but that.  For the most part the guys ignored my table (they went all the way to the back where we could barely see them).  Afterwards we were told there would be a meet an greet but only a few came out to quickly sign autographs then left (one was not even that nice about it) and the others skiped out the back door. 

This is my last night in Vegas and I was hoping to end it with a bang but to my disappointment that was not to be.  My advice to the guys/people who run the show (should they happen to read this) would be to make sure that you pay equal attention to both the front and back of the room.  It is really bad form to ignore thevpeople who paid top dollar to see you.I've heard about Shady's for years, and kept thinking it would be some dirty, gritty dive bar. It's more like being invited into an affluent friend's condo. It's small, stylish, and one of the cleanest places I've ever seen. The beer selection is small, but solid. I approve of that German Hefeweizen...Weisensomething...that they carry. It was a little on the warm side for me, but a brew I don't see every day at a fair price. 

They also had some hard-to-find ciders in there. Very limited supply of the rare stuff, so get it while it lasts. They've got a cocktail menu as well, and when I asked for something with citrus, was recommended an item that tasted like an orange popsicle. I couldn't taste the alcohol, but it totes hit me about 15 minutes later. 

The patio is where most of the socializing happens, even if it is tiny...and out in the front. Even on a slower Wednesday night, there was a decent amount of people, but I have absolutely no clue how Shady's could function on a bustling Friday night. It's cramped! I still like it though, it just doesn't have anything unique that jumps out at me to demand a return.Had to meet a client here for a quick cocktail before dinner. Being in the Four Seasons, it's a very quiet location; perfect for uninterrupted discussions. The service was excellent; our waiter was constantly available without being a nuisance.I would give this roller coaster four stars if not for the price. $14 for one ride? Really? I must be dumb, because I went for it anyways. The first half of the ride is great, but it loses steam on the second half (read: gravity). You go through the standard loop, barrels, upside down twists, etc, but for some reason this ride is really jerky.

If you haven't been on too many roller coasters this might be something you'll want to try, especially since its a) in Las Vegas, and b) it wraps around and through the NY NY casino. My recommendation is to go on the ride after you have digested your last meal and not drink too much before getting on. Still, $14 is steep for just one ride.They show a lot of great movies that dont make it into the wide releases but hte seats smell like cheese. 
I have been to multiple theaters inside camelview 5 and they all smell like cheese!

I dont know how clean they are but they need to step it up.Great breakfast here the first time we ate at here, but the second time seemed like the staff was either overworked or very inexperienced.  Our table of 10 didn't have a waitress at it for 10-15 minutes, the food was good though, albeit it that too came out extremely slow.  Overall it was a good experience, but we'll see the if we come here a third time or not...checked this place out after having lunch with a friend. 

discounts for nevada residents. so i got the atomic testing pass and the area 51 pass. the atomic stuff was really interesting. informative. a really friendly guy named SAM just came up and started talking to me. asked me where i was from and i did the same. he volunteers once a week. he was an employee of the nevada test site. he was in the navy and said he worked there until they didnt like his vernacular(i think thats what he said) i asked what he meant and he said he dropped too many f-bombs. haha funny guy. after talking for a bit he walks around and kinda does an informal tour guide thing for anyone looking at the exhibits. seems like he really enjoys meeting and talking to people.

there were a lot of tools, equipment, and videos. i hope they checked all the stuff for radiation before bringing the stuff in.

went to the area 51 afterwards. i was led in by a guy and he kinda did a brief "you need to be debriefed before you head in" and i was left in a room to watch a video of some guy talking. maybe i have ADD but i couldnt help but watch the smoke from the cigarette billowing throughout the video. the video was kinda boring...

when you walk in its kinda eerie and you expect to have someone jump out of the wall like in a halloween scare house. but its just a bunch of videos and information about stuff you normally see on tv or can readily find on the internet. i wasnt too impressed with the area 51 exhibit. you can tell it was never intended to be in the building due to the construction of it. 

went to a reading section or something and when i walked in the lady approached me and said hello. said the reading materials were free. as i walked around to see what they had she started to talking to me. i forgot what she was saying but she wasnt looking at me when i looked at her. then i realized she was talking on her bluetooth headset. she welcomed me while she was still on the phone. it was clearly a personal call. when i left that area i felt like i was disturbing her personal phone call more than anything. there wasnt really anything interesting anyhow.

dont waste your time with the area 51 exhibit, the most i got out of it was a nice walk in a dark room expecting for someone to jump out and scare me.From the minds of Fez and Switch.  Ticoz is their answer to craving that cute cabana boy.  The food is delish (Latin inspired but not too spicy food).  The guacamole is more of a guacahummus which is good.  The waffle fries can be hit or miss.  When its good, its really good.  When it gets cold, the corn meal becomes rock hard and the insides soggy and greasy.  The mojitos are always good and during HH you can't help but have about four of them.  The outdoor patio is great, however the misters can go on full blast and have a devastating effect on clothes and hair and there is no way to regulate the misters.  Service is kind and they dont' rush you in and out which is nice.  Great desserts (which will make up for ordering a healthy but large salad on the menu)The food was amazing, however small salad portions.  I ordered the basil tomato salad it was ok but very small.  The calamari was great a better portion and was not over cooked.  I had a glass of wine that was recommended by the server good but not great.  
  The reason for the 2 star loss is that the service was just so so.  My sister had to wait a long time to get her wine and the server did not explain the chef's specials, we had to ask him.  Slow service and it was not a full house.  Waters ran empty and trying to get him to come by more than twice was hard.  We had another server who was not in our section that did a better job.  I would go here again just hope to get a good server with more wine knowledge.I finally tried this place and honestly it tastes like other good gelato shops.  The hassle of the parking lot and rude drivers just gives me anxiety.  I'd rather not get stressed out before I try to enjoy dessert.   The next time I eat at La Grande Orange I might stop in for dessert but I don't see myself making a special trip.This is a "Yay! I did it. Now I can cross THAT off my list." hike for me. It's very challenging and the summit view is spectacular and it's a cool feeling to take it all in from the jagged rock landing at the tippy top. It's cool to be able to point to this tall peak and say "I've been up there!" 

I don't, however, like the sucky parking and I hate having people "all up on me" while I'm hugging the side to give them plenty of room to pass. PASS ME already!! 

I wish there were a  few hours carved out of the day, or a day designated just for those of us who can't haul ass up there, so we could enjoy the sense of accomplishment along the way -- kind of like how they have lap swim times at the public pools! :)Every time I walk through the big glass doors of PF Changs, I hate myself a little more. I tell myself, "That summer I spent in China won't make me jaded when it comes to Chinese food" but I'm wrong. Though I admit... I've been jaded when it comes to Chinese food since I came to Arizona. I used this line before in my review for George and Son's in Scottsdale, but Arizona feels like the land that Chinese food forgot. Every single place out here that I have tried (other than PF Changs) uses low quality meat, large amounts of MSG, and overall is disappointing in every aspect. This is why I go to PF Changs.

I come from Philadelphia, which has a pretty large Chinatown. When I first learned of the Chinese situation here, a tear rolled down my cheek. Chinese food is a staple to my existence (as someone who is Jewish, my Christmas's would be lost without it!). I try my hardest to allow PF Changs fill this void while I am here.

While I admire the service and the atmosphere, and some dishes are alright, it just doesn't do it for me. The portions are very tiny, the prices are high, and I hate the commercialization. 

My personal recommendation is to get the Chicken Chow Fun. For the price, this is the largest thing on the menu. This is a dish of wide egg noodles with large white meat cuts of chicken.

Here is a picture for reference (though this is Beef Chow Fun):

http://jadecafe2565.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/Beef_Chow_Ho_Fun-3.29102408_std.JPG

Sometimes this comes with the noodles undercooked. Sometimes this comes drowning in sauce. Though most of the time it comes just right.  I grew to love this dish after my time over there. It is a staple street food that I could get for 5 RMB at the most (around 70 cents). Nothing PF Changs can come up with even touches the lowest tier of Chinese cuisine over there.

PF Changs and myself were in a marriage of convenience. Once I leave Arizona, I don't see myself ever setting foot in one ever again.Pros: Full kitchen which saved us a ton of money,  walking distance from strip, friendly staff; especially Lauren from the kids club, nice memory foam pull out bed. Nice, big, clean rooms. We had the two bedroom suite which included a big jacuzzi tub and big shower with dual shower heads. The room also had two pull out sofa beds.

Cons: valet took forever, 2 small shallow pools (we paid money to use
other hotel pools) hotel is renovating and there were only three elevators available. The wait for an elevator was at least 5-10 minutes. Flat uncomfortable pillows (bring your own from home) Two different times during our 4 day stay some sort of loud alarm went off. Today at 6am I was awoken to the alarm saying there was an emergency reported in the building and to evacuate the building by stairs and not elevator. It was extremely scary for me and my children,  and really stunk being on the 24th floor! It turned out to be a false alarm and no one bothered to let us know right away. I had to call the front desk and ask what the emergency was and they simply replied "there isn't one" I feel bad for the people who didn't call and actually walked down 24 flights of stairs for no reason. When they finally decided to announce that it was a false alarm we still had to hear the loud ear piercing alarm for another 10 minutes. 

I personally will not be returning to this hotel but think that other people would enjoy staying here because of the big rooms and kitchen.We used to go to Hash House for breakfast all of the time.  We loved their french toast and gigantic waffle.  However, in the last two months, we have stopped going as the last 3 times we went, the meat and eggs were entirely TOO greasy for some reason and the waffle was doughy (not cooked enough) and my french toast was burned.  It takes an incredibly long time to get food re-done and honestly, I have to evaluate if the value is there as the breakfasts are pricey.  I don't need a ton of food, just good quality of food as they used to have.  I gave them three stars as everyone should try them once, and my hope is they return to quality as then I will gladly return to the restaurant.  Until then, so many other places to have breakfast in Vegas for far less $. We also tried them for dinner to see if there was a difference with the kitchen perhaps but nope, over salted food and my now my bacon and french toast were both burned....twenty minutes later, still chasing the server to check on our food.......dropping another star on this review soon.......We went for lunch on a Sunday, because it would be more casual and cheaper.  I didn't expect a lame metal detector when you get in.

The restaurant spins very slowly, and takes something like an hour and a half to fully rotate.  I can't imagine getting dizzy because of this, but with enough wine, I guess anyone could.  Obviously everything is pricey.  I don't think the food was amazing enough to be priced that way, but it was very good nonetheless.  

The view was great, I imagine its really great at night as well.  There are crazy rides on top of the building, so occasionally you see a glimpse of people flying around above you.  Service was impeccable, and we ended up staying almost two hours.  Glad to have gone, but probably wouldn't go back.Wanted to love this place!! Annnnnd, didn't. The food was just "ok". The people that worked there were nice. Service was super slow even though we were the only ones there at the time. I think the long wait hyped us up even more...thinking it would be delicious. Nope. Just..."eh".So after going to  Famous Dave's and eating their atrocious BBQ, I thought I'd try to find another spot, local or chain, that had better things to offer.  Most of the reviews were decent on TC's so I figured it was close enough to work to go check it out.

I took some co-workers to go with.

I had the 3 meat platter with chicken (dark meat), pulled pork and baby back ribs.  Side of slaw and mac and cheese.

Pulled pork was great, so was the chicken. 

Ribs were greatly lacking, and since their name is "Rib Crib", I expected better.  They were a bit tough to start with and didn't just tear apart with ease like you'd expect.  The flavor was great until I had some charred meat from the underside of the ribs where they obviously reheated on a grill.  All I could taste was burnt charcoal.

Mac and cheese had decent flavor and it was nice to have it super cheesy but it was incredibly greasy, so that's the drawback of that side.

Slaw was typical slaw, nothing to write home about.

Two people at the table had pulled pork sandwiches and they loved those.  Another person had rib tips and actually really enjoyed those but he said they weren't the best he's had by far.  The last person at the table also had the 3 meat combo and had rib tips, baby backs and brisket.

He said he wasn't a fan of the brisket, the rib tips decent, but the most awful part of his meal were the baby backs.  They ended up being tougher than mine, harder to eat and very dry.  Also had the nasty blacked char on one side.

He did in fact love his sides, dirty rice and baked beans.

Otherwise the service was great, super friendly and very attentive.  Refills on drinks overflowed and it definitely made up for the quality of SOME of the food.  I'd definitely go back but not for ribs, and that's the most disappointing part.

I bought the Yelp deal, the 10 for 20 dollar deal.  If it's available, get it yourself and then try the 3 meat combo yourself.  Definitely the way to go if you want to sample all the choices since it's roughly 17.99 on it's own.  So you end up saving money!You can get a 5 star experience her if ...

You NEED order really well. The menu is hit and miss. Both times I've been her I have had wonderful dishes ... and the well documented "over priced chinese food." I'd personally go for the Sea Bass and the Lobster Wontons with Shiitake Ginger Broth. If Tao put as much love into all there dishes as they put into the atmosphere ... this place would be a slam dunk. But as it is both of my experiences left me wanting more attention place on some of the items we ordered.

I would also recommend you take advantage of the free night club entry. Otherwise you may feel like you paid way to much for the experience.Probably not the best sushi you'll ever have. But for the only place  downtown where you can get sushi for a decent price, it ain't bad.  I wouldn't particularly go for dinner, but the lunch price is pretty good.Stopped in to check out, and ASU women's preseason game was going on.  Got in for free, stayed for first 10 minutes then left.  This was very adequate from when it was built (late 60s?) to about 10 years ago, but ASU probably will need a new building in the not too distant future it it's to stay competitive with other schools.  No suites and concourses not very wide.  But all around the concourse there's a nice athletic Hall of Fame exhibit (Reggie Jackson, Barry Bonds, Phil Mickleson, Pat Tillman and many many others). Reminds me of Purdue's Mackey Arena but all seats at ASU have seatbacks.  Views are good.  Parking can be a pain if you don't have permits or are unwilling to pay; had to walk about 3 blocks on a Sunday afternoon from strip mall.I would have given this a higher rating except for the prices.  Ok - in this economy, I am lucky to be able to eat out at all.  However, $11 for their smallest sandwich and two small sides and a drink ($1.99 each!!) is a little pricey especially if you have a family to feed.  They should consider making it a buffet since they charge buffet prices or giving you a little more for you money.

But, yes, the food is good.Meh...somewhere between hearing Lil Jon's "Get Low" and the average ayce, I'm not too thrilled.The decor is beautiful. I recommend requesting a table near the double sided fireplace. If you dine on the outdoor patio you can also request a table near the fireplace. Service was friendly and attentive. We had an early dinner and there were not many diners which may have contributed to the short wait time for food. The complimentary bread, olives and cheese are a nice touch. The Shrimp Risotta comes with 4 jumbo shrimp. For my taste the shrimp were a little overcooked. However the risotta was wonderful, silky and cooked perfectly. The Chicken Piccata dinner included a large portion of chicken and was juicy and tender. The dinner includes spinach but you can substitute for another vegi or potato. OveralI I believe there are other Italian restaurants on the west side of Las Vegas that offer better value. The wines are also a little on the pricey side.Service was great. Decor was good. Food had some real high ups, and some lows. Started with Crudo and Burrata. Burrata was real good, crudo wasn't that good. I think the Crudo wasn't as fresh as it could have been. The Pennettee alla Vodka was really good. My Nove Spaghetti wasn't. The lobster in the spaghetti came with an intense ammonia taste when I ate it. I mean Windex intense. Finished with the tiramisu, which was great.

Overall, service is great and food was a hit/miss on that night. Which means I intend to try it all again and see how the dishes pan out. Everyone else seemed to love it so maybe it was just a weird night.Good atmosphere, great service, food was just okay.First night and we need to get some good dinner. 

Chaste and clean but not really spotless, It would be a four star but I reserve that for other International buffets like one I had in SoCA, forgotten. I think this ones @ Mirage Hotel and Casino. Its like $25 per head, I usually go to just the Asian/ American food but if I was to choose, I wouldnt come here. Buffet is good once in a while but i like doing ala cartes better. A narrower choice of food menu satisfies me more at the end of the meal. 

This place is not for me that night. I was tired-- i couldve settled for a subway and go to bed or start the chillaxing. I eat only to the point im full and not to the point of almost puking just to get your money's worth. My sis loves food and oh how she loves buffet. I guess she splurged with all those desserts. If she has a yelp account this would surely get high stars for her.Came here for lunch. This buffet was alright. Nothing really stood out but it wasn't bad at all.

The best item here was definitely the Prime rib and the crab legs. The prime rib was a perfect medium rare. It was super soft and tender. The crab legs were sweet and juicy. 

They surprisingly served breakfast items still (maybe it was brunch) such as bacon, scrambled eggs, eggs benedict, sausage, ham, and others. They also have sushi selection, carved turkey, fried chicken, pastas, mussels, shrimp, salad bar, fruit bar, and desserts.

Overall, the food was fresh and tasty. Good selection to choose from.Went for the breakfast buffet.  Lots of variety and good food.  The turkey bacon was way over cooked, not good at all.  I was disappointed bc i dont eat pork but love turkey bacon.  Got a seat with a nice view of the pool. Service was great.I heard that Beauty Bar was recently sold.  I am optimistic about its future.  

I have never been a fan of that layout of Beauty Bar or its drink selection.  (2 Stars)  I am a huge fan of many of the artists that perform at Beauty Bar (4 Stars) however...so 3 Stars seemed fitting.

I am hoping that the new ownership gives BB a complete makeover, but also that they keep it as a music venue *crosses fingers*...anyway only time will tell what the future holds.  For now you should go to Beauty Bar if want to see a specific act...not because it's a great venue.A cafe that was slightly bigger. Fast to order because line wasn't that long, but a lot of people were eating here. It is a cheaper option compared to the other restaurants at Wynn. 

Food came slow since it was made to order. 
I got the soup and 1/2 sandwich combo. The clam chowder soup I got was good on the flavor and seems healthier since didn't seem like cream/milk was put into it, but it was on the cold side. I wished it was hotter. The turkey sandwich was meh, not that good. The mayo didn't help with the flavoring much so i used the horseradish to up the flavor. Way too much meat on the sandwich so i took out most of it. I was hungry, so i had to eat it.Sorry but I have to bump it down a star because they have the same menu for dang near 2x the cost for dinner....I had expected SOMETHING (anything!) to be different, but nope...not at all. Just a note: The food is decent overall, after going a FEW times I can honestly say that, but no matter what, I just can't eat as much as I feel I should and at dinner prices - I almost stuffed myself on purpose! I am looking forward to trying a few new places on my next trip out that way.Been here a couple of times.  This place is ok.  Service was good.  I had the chili cheese fries.  They were so bad.  I also had a whiskey and coke.  I can't really say much good or much bad about this place.  It was really really cold inside, though.We decided to grab some food before a concert we came to see at The Club. 
We did not go in the restaurant, but sat at the bar outside instead. 
It was happy hour so I ordered a Mango margarita for $5 and nachos for $5. 
The mango drink was delicious....not too sweet, which is also a concern with fruit drinks. Didn't really taste the alcohol, which is fine, because I was just having it with my meal. 
The nachos were ok. They didn't look like a lot on the plate, but they filled me up. I ordered a side of salsa, because I don't like the onions in the pico.
I would give the nachos a 2 and the drink a 5....so overall I gave it a 3. 
I would definitely return for the drinks. 
The service was just ok.we came here laate at night, so i didnt expect the food to be too good. oh well, we didnt really want to keep searching for restaurants at 11 PM. you cant argue with the prices here, if you order the combo with like 6 dishes. the food was ehh, average. everything was cooked well, but the flavors werent too good. i dont think its THAT bad, i can imagine myself giving this place maybe 4 stars during regular dinner time IF the customer service was a little betterIt was awesome until I got charged for a corona  I didn't drink. Until that I was in love.This was the first place in America that I finally had a good shabu shabu experience. The waiter was nice and attentive even tho the place became swamped! during lunch and he was the only guy there, I felt bad for him! Anyways the spicy miso broth with all the verities of mushrooms are a must have! Tons of flavor!!! I didn't really care for the meat selection because in my opinion, the meat cannot absorb the flavors of the broth well and for those who know shabu shabu, that is were the money is!  All in all the food was good, my only complaint is that they should have more servers on staff.How often do you see a pasty shop in US? I went to Cornish Pasty with a lot of expectations (since I'm a big lover of pasties). Maybe because of my high expectations, I found the pasties to be just good enough. The sticky toffee pudding was great though (again, how often do you see sticky toffee pudding on the menu!).

Service staff is very nice and friendly . Food takes forever to get.Eh.  It's just a sammich.

With the inflated prices, it's a better value to just order the combo for $15, which includes your sammich, a drink, chips, and choice of fruit.  The sammiches are all about $10, and a bottled water is $3.50.  

I tried the chicken salad.  The bread was fresh, but I regretted the choice in meat later, as the mayo just sat like a blob in my stomach.  I really wanted to try the steak 'n egg one, but didn't have the appetite for it on this day.  

Not too much to yelp about.The Colicchio brand name is strong with this one. A sandwich shoppe using ingredients and crafting sandwiches with integrity.

I was able to try the meatloaf, egg & wild mushroom, and a particular incarnation of a chicken breast sandwiches respectively. Unfortunately nothing to write home about. The meatloaf was above average, the egg & wild mushroom needed some salt content (!), and the chicken breast sandwich I tried was good not great. The bread each sandwich came on was delicious though. You could tell that the ingredients were fresh and higher quality than most of Vegas as a whole. No real big chances taken and--sadly--no real big flavor here.

But consider that this is a place in the middle of the largest hotel in Las Vegas along one of its busiest walking areas (a lå shopping mall), so not the best ambience. Not to mention that you want to put a "lowest common denominator" type of place in that spot. (Everyone loves sammiches!) It is above average quality for a city where buffets and $4.99 Steak Specials draw moths to their flame, but the price really undoes its coveted fourth star for me. But then again, people go to Vegas to burn money so maybe it would be a 4-star for you. Definitely worth a shot but be wary.

Sorry Chef Colicchio, but unless I see you in the kitchen sometime soon, I doubt I'll be coming back.A little on the pricey side, but it is a gourmet sandwich place and you get a good amount of food. For $15, you get a sandwich of your choice, a bag of chips, your choice of an apple or banana, and a drink including some bottled selections.

I ordered the goat cheese sandwich based on the reviews here. The flavors were interesting, but it lacked seasoning/salt. I was concerned that the sandwich would lack texture and be a mushy mess. The walnuts didn't offer much in that department and were barely detectible. The celery slices on the other hand, gave the sandwich a fresh cool crunch. I had a side of BBQ bagged kettle chips. House made kettle chips would be a nice touch here and give this place that real gourmet feel.The food here= AMAZING! So good!! I went during lunch time. It wasn't too busy but it took forever for us to get our food. I ordered the fat Greek salad with chicken and my friend ordered the fat gyro. I wouldn't think it takes that long to make. 
We didn't get refills on our water either. 
3 stars goes to the delicious food!This place seems to be hit or miss.  I have stopped in here many times in the late evening to grab some food since its right around the corner from my place. 
Some of the staff are very friendly and try to make conv, while other times I have been in there and they almost seem annoyed that I am asking them for a drink and what not.
The Chicken tenders that they server are great since they are not the normal Tyson brand breaded tenders.Red Rock is one of the nicer local casino's in the valley although I do have a couple of comments to make in regards to customer service. On a busy night it is almost impossible to get a drink in a timely fashion. I waited almost 1 hour last week for a simple vodka/cranberry. The other issue I have is that they do not offer enough low limit tables on the weekends. They only had one $10 blackjack table going a few weeks ago. All of the other tables were $15,20, 25, 50, 100 hand tables.Literally walking distance from my door I'm still of mixed feelings about Red Rock.  Sure it has a convenient theater and bowling, but both are overpriced compared to other 'locals' casinos.  Sure it has some unique restaurants, but they are in a constant state of chef turnover and flux.  Add in the fact that there is no shopping to speak of until the Shops at Summerlin open and I see this as a nice "upscale" locals spot, but not something one should go out of their way of for anything other than gambling and perhaps the occasional night of entertainment.  Credit is due to the "no smoking" games, but they really aren't so far off from the standard games and options are limited.I'm a HUGE fan of macarons, so I really needed to check this place out during my stay in Vegas.

I saw pictures of the size of their macarons, and as they say, pictures don't lie. The macarons were definitely way bigger than usual. 

However, with that said, I thought the taste itself were just okay. I didn't think they were anything special, and a bit too sweet for me. I've had a cinnamon one, which I don't think any other place had this flavor before, so that was kind of cool. But still, not worth my $3.50 and deliberately coming here for a pastry!Let me start by saying you can have a blast here.  Bottom line: there's a lot to do, but most of the place is pretty run-down.  

COST:
I came here with my husband and his stepson (age 20) and we bought an unlimited 4-hour package, for $15 each ($20 Mon-Fri, plus their website has a coupon for another $5 off).  We truly had a fun-filled 4-plus hours, and there were many things we didn't have time to do.

ATTRACTIONS:
We played mini-golf on all of their courses (three), rode go-karts four times, went on the bumper boats (where some cruel child pushed me under the waterfall - don't carry anything you can't get wet), and even had soft pretzels at their cafe.  

CrackerJax also has a medium-sized arcade and offers laser tag.  There's bungy dome, a driving range for adults, batting cages, and a really nice sand volleyball court.     

MINI-GOLF:
We have all been to other mini golf courses and had to agree that, although this place has three, they're all painfully simple and boring.  Most of the holes are just a green with a hole on the opposite end of the tee (which is just a paint mark - in my experience, there ought to be a rubber thing with divets for three balls), and the course is totally devoid of fun obstacles like windmills, etc.  At other golf courses, we've seen maybe one or two totally simple holes like that, and the rest are all far more interesting.  The Optical Delusion course was by far the best, but fell far short of interesting.  

GO-KARTS: 
The Go-Karts are great fun!!  It's a nice, long course and you stay out for about five minutes.  They have one-seaters and two-seaters, and different height requirements for passengers (so littler guys can ride with parents). Two complaints: they seem to have just as many cars out of commission as working, which made the wait times significantly longer (we were there on a Monday afternoon - this would have taken a TON of time on a weekend with bigger crowds), and several of the carts aren't quite 100% functional (basically, it's possible to get a really slow one).  The teenagers running the ride also sent a girl out in a cart that didn't work properly (they knew this beforehand because they were trying to fix it) and it broke down and had to be pushed back in.

BUMPER BOATS:
The bumper boats are a lot of fun, and the pool is very pretty, but once again, several boats were just sitting there, broken, making the lines longer.  

CAFE:
The cafe is super run-down.  The pretzels were good enough, but it looked like the place was right out of the '90s.

Overall, CrackerJax seems to be doing a lot of things, but none of them super well.  It's a great place to take kids (of all ages) for a variety of entertainment, but keep your expectations a bit low.3am carne asada fries! Go mop up the booze that's flooding your digestive tract.The Happy Hour prices here are great - $5 each.  The Tempura Spicy Tuna Rolls are the bomb.  Wine selection is just "meh".  Good drinks on Happy Hour.  The service was just so/so.  Definitely a "chain" restaurant.I went with a group of people whom had been here before and loved it I thought it was ok. We waited to be sat for a few minutes and the place was pretty empty so it started off just ok fro me. The server/owner sat us while she was talking on the phone which anywhere else would have been so not right, here it actually seemed ok! That being said the atmosphere was very laid back, like there was not a care in the world, and judging by the decore, and clutter in this place I have a feeling i am right on the money. The menu was ok, no greens? I like greens with my southern cookin. I must say the fried chicken was some of the best I have ever had. It was so crispy on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside. The waffle was good but had nothin on lolo's. The corn bread was a bit dry and the mac and cheese had good flavor but it was over cooked and mushy! I don't like the dirty taste of catfish but this was not bad, and the okra was okra. I would go back if someone else wanted to go! O the coke was flat!I must say I have been here before on several occasions and loved it ; however this time my expectations were so high only to leave me with mediocre thoughts of this visit. 
First of all I am all about cleanliness , but I could not help but focus on my spotted , unpolished wine glass. My husband tried to get my attention off the topic , but it still was in the back of mind. 
   On the bright side with a few glasses of Riesling I was able to get over it . Upon our arrival I was surprised by the speakeasy entrance where I focused my eyes on the door I was sure was to secretly open, was actually on the opposite side. This greeting is a fun goodfellas type greeting in a secret corridor. 
For starters my hubby and I both had a salad -his with house vinaigrette and I chose the bleu cheese. He was quite pleased but mine was drenched in the bleu cheese. Blech! I don't like my salad drowning in the dressing. 
For dinner we both chose the Scarface shrimp scampi . On the plus side the shrimp was plump and generous in size. 
The linguine was flavored with a small amount of scampi seasoning , tomatoes and garlic. The flavor was good but it was as if the chef dumped the linguine out and didn't toss the seasoning all the way through. I can eat some pasta but this was like a bland pile of linguine for $25 a plate , I expected more. 
The ambiance was warm and relaxing. On Fridays they have a frank Sinatra crooner singing old blue eyes remakes. On my previous visits they would be playing old mobster movies but this time it was showing a basketball game. 
The best thing to make up for my downer of dinner was the dessert! Chocolate cannoli's were Devine,with a rich, cinnamon chocolate coating= tasty!
All in all , I still like this place . I will just order a different plate next time, I also may consider going to the Sahara location.? I love the idea and nostalgia Capo's brings so I am willing to give it another visit.  Try it for yourself , meanwhile I will forget about it !!!!!This is the only place that inspires any shopping excitement for Boyfriend. And, since the universe is very ordered, I hate coming here just as much as he hates going shopping with me. 

The good thing about Fry's, and the reason I go back, is because they have just about everything. Appliances, electronics (home and vehicle), toys, games, office furniture, flash drives, post-its, Apple items, all the electronics accessories and everything you could possibly need to construct a computer on your own. Boyfriend is in almost constant need of computer parts, so we're here a lot.

Another good thing is how efficient their processes are. Checkout is usually a breeze, as the line is always in order and they have an employee directing traffic. Returns are even easier. For some items, you're given a slip by the employee near the products, which you give to the cashier, who retrieves your item. 

The downside comes when you actually need to find an employee who a) has time to help you and b) knows how to help you. The store (at least the more popular parts) is busy and employees seem to be stretched thin. When you do find someone, the chances of them knowing what you're talking about and where it's located are like 30%. It's frustrating, especially if you have a question or need one of those items that you can't just grab off a shelf.Stopped by Di Sciacca when I noticed that the glasses at Latitude Eight Thai Grill, as well as the wall art, came from here.  (While I drove around looking for the restaurant, I spotted this little shop around the corner.)  Loved all the colorful glasses on display.  I wanted to buy a few sets for myself and also to give as Christmas presents, but noticed that most of the glasses I inspected had imperfections :(  

Besides glassware, Di Sciacca also sells vases, bowls, ashtrays, bracelets, and antique furniture, among other things.  All made in China.  Loved the boat bookshelves!  

Will come back shortly to look for better selections.David is quite possibly the worst customer service agent. He's very much a no person with an amazingly bland personality. We had to request a manager to get us our room and when we did request a manager David threw a fit. In my opinion he should not be checking people into their rooms. Not a great first impression when your your spending over 300 dollars a night. Besides that, this place is amazing and beautifully upgraded. Everyone else seems to be quite happy to help and accommodate your needs.The Buffet at the Red Rock, "Feast" is decent.  The price is good.  

The carved beef is about a par, not bad to call it sub-par, but not great to rave about it either.

The selection is good, it's an international buffet featuring Mexican, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, American, Seafood, Salad(s), Deserts and "something for everyone" - - but to me, no signature dish I would always crave or come here specifically for.

The price and selection makes this an above average option.

If you're a hotel guest, you can get line cuts through their express line, which helps.  I hear some of the locals are able to find coupons for 2 for 1, which would make this a fantastic deal for any couple or family going out for a meal.I don't really like to eat at buffets. Not really a big fan of cafeteria style food. That being said, I don't mind having lunch at Feast buffet once in a while. It is clean and they have pretty good salad bar. I usually just eat the roasted chicken and salad if I go here, so I can't speak on the rest of the selections.It was an okay buffet. Had a really long line for no reason. The food was decent.Surprisingly food tastes better than it looks, and it comes with unlimited beer/wine. It's bang for your buck type of buffet. It wasn't one of the greatest buffets but it didn't taste bad either. I say try it if you are @ palmsDecent lunch buffet, with variety. Good price. Tried the beef brisket and ribs, which got great reviews from others--good flavor, but lots of fat on them. Most of the food was bland.
Definitely save room for the dessert bar. Deep-dish pecan pie was quite tasty. Oreo cake was good too.It's a party on Mondays and weekends, and more chill Tuesday through Thursday. Free for locals on Mondays so that's really the only day I go.  Pool is smaller than most, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, and of course you'll pay top dollar for drinks.  Tip-be nice to the staff and they'll be nice to you.The lightrail is my main form of transportation. I also ride the 19c (METS on Google Maps) a lot which is free. It makes my life much easier, and it really needs to run 24 hours. If they cut the security checks, they could afford it. The security guards are often rude and have harassed me for no reason. There are some nice ones that stick out too though. The buses are often late or early and seemingly not reliable. That being said, I usually enjoy the pleasant demeanor of the drivers. Go with the rail if you can.Yeah, yeah.  The food ain't so hot.  But the beer is good and there are plenty of TVs.  The service is pretty and pretty good.  What are you doing a half-mile deep in a mall in Vegas looking for haute cuisine? They have beer, sports and A/C. Park your a** on a stool and wait out the rest of your party as they ooh and aah over baubles and get lost in the mall 'cuz it is shaped like a figure 8.  Cute trick to get more time to drink -- when the wife returns ask her if she saw (insert name of store)  and convince her that she missed part of the mall.

Just for fun, find a picture of their logo and check if you see the same "optical illusion" that my friends and I did.I remember coming to this place many years ago and totally loving it.  I recently went back and it was just OK.   I had the pulled pork sandwich and it wasn't very tender and covered in sauce (albeit very good sauce) and onions string as a side.   The onion strings looked really greasy, but once I tried them they were pretty tasty and crunchy.

I'll go back because there are so few dining options in this area of the Valley.Our trip to Vegas ended with neither a bang nor a whimper and that was fine by me. After spending time at Red Rocks Canyon, we wanted a simple dinner before heading to the airport to catch our flight. We initially went to The Vintner Grill, but that was way too upscale for what we had in mind. We'd been hiking all day and I wasn't feeling (or looking) swanky. While I prefer non-chain options, this brewpub clearly has their act together.

BJ's has a sports bar feel and an enormous projection TV above the bar as well as multiple flat screens throughout the large restaurant. Sunday night brought out people in droves, and I can understand why, since this place seems equally enjoyable for families, singles and groups. It was a great place to watch some football and the restaurant just hums with activity.

The service was incredibly efficient and we saw the entire staff hustling. What is unfortunate is that the food isn't nearly as special as the atmosphere and service. Mr. K ordered a beer and I had to be different and chose hard cider, but neither was great. One of their specialties is deep dish pizza and again it was only OK. For the standard entrees, portion sizes are enormous and I was happy we shared dessert since the BJ's Brownie is served piled high with whipped cream.

For the food alone, this is a three-star joint, but it really doesn't give this place enough credit. It would be a semi-regular hangout if they were located in my home town. Funnily enough, my local sports bar has a very similar name.I get to blame Ayesha for this one.  :-)  Once again I ventured alone into a restaurant that I had never had the style of food before and had no clue what it was supposed to taste like or how to properly eat it.  I too like non chain places if they have something to offer and she made it sound like it was worth trying.  I was out that direction to go to Walmart and put a stop here in the itinerary. 

Walked in just before 7 and the owner (?) was sitting with friends in the corner.  He gave me a minute or so to read the menu and came over behind the counter.  I said I would like the sampler platter appetizer ($6.49) and he looked at me strange and said "there is no meat in that".  This is something that is mostly a guy thing, When cooking for somebody else the meat is the signature of how many of us cook.  Doesn't matter if the rest of the food is under/overcooked or the cat stole the cheese, the meat better be right.  In a small restaurant like this where much of what is served has to come from purchased stuff with some seasoning modifications the only chance the cook thinks he has to show off is in the preparation of the meat entree and I had just taken that from him.  Never the less I stuck to my original order.

I was started off with a hot bowl of lentil soup, I don't think this was part of what I ordered but I was the only customer in there and he was bound and determined to find a way to show off.  The plate came and included hummus, baba ghanoush, dolma, falafel.  He took the time to explain what I was being served.  On the side was naan and a dipping sauce for the falafel.  On the plate was also tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce.  The presentation was good enough it could have come on real dishes from a restaurant at a much higher price level, I know the dish could have been take out but a lot would have been lost.  Other than falafel all of the dishes were new to me and I had a fun time exploring the different tastes and serving combination's.  About halfway through the owner came over to see how I was doing and answered some further questions I had about what I was eating.  I only made it through about 2/3 of the whole meal before I was full.

I enjoyed the meal and clearly the owner is all about making the experience a good one.  If you are not familiar with the area it is easy to miss.  83rd Ave turns into W Lake Pleasant Pkwy at Beardsley going North and takes a gentle curve West.  Guessing, I took the first left into a strip mall I could and landed right where I wanted.  Not bad for a guy at night without a navigator. :-)The actual name of this place on the outside is Coinless Laundry, not Diamond back Laundries!  It took me a while to find this place on yelp due to the different names, but this IS the place, because I checked the address before I left the place yesterday....

My apartment complex shut down the laundry rooms here at my apartment complex, claiming that they are doing gas pipeline work to the dryers throughout the complex.  Until it's fixed, I've been taking my laundry to the laundry mat so I can have clean clothes.

I've been to this Laundromat before in the past for larger loads of laundry that I have, for such things as comforters, blankets and so forth.  It's an extra mile out of the way, but it's one of the nicer laundromats that I've been to in the area.  Is it the nicest? No, but it's slightly above the rest.  

The place is clean, with tons of washers and dryers. It's a card operated system, and they have a machine that provides cards (for a small fee) and takes cash (bills only) to add value to your card.  For every $10 that you put on, I think you get a bonus dollar added to the value of the card.

They also have a full time on site attendant, who can help you if you should need it.  Weather it's getting change, help with using the machines, or just have questions, the staff here can help you.  They also sell laundry supplies, but are a bit pricey, so try to bring you own to save a few bucks.

I think the prices here are a bit steep, but not by a whole lot.  For a small single load machine it's $1.39, and 60 cents to dry for 20 minutes.  They have a large selection of double and triple loaders, and even have a few machines that are 8 loaders!  I don't know what would be that big to wash, but it's there if you need it.  They also have several nice carts here to help you move your laundry from the washer to the dryer, or to one of their many folding tables so you can put your clothes together before you leave.  I think they also have wifi, so you can surf the net while your clothes get clean!I think I wanted to like this place more because Yelp offered a 15% off the bill, that I didn't get to use anyways. Apparently you have to write the review while in the restaurant, then show it to the management, then they will give you the discount. Talk about pressure. Since Yelp doesn't allow you to post a review, only draft it, I was unable to do this, or use the coupon. 

The food was alright, nothing fancy. The egg drop soup was very jelly like, and reminded me of weird school lunch. Not sure if this is normal but i've never had jelly soup before.

The staff was friendly, and I believe its family operated. Would eat there again, but now know I can't use the discount, especially after writing this.Just recently sold some used equipment. They were very nice, helped me unload. Told me it was going to take a few moments. So I browsed around looking at a lot of cool stuff. This place had a whole lot of music equipment, new or used. Liked their stage they had set up. Showing live concerts on a screen. This place is really a nice place, great options, great crew. Now why did I give them a 3-star review?

I understand they need to make a profit, I know they need to buy their used equipment low as possible. I did a lot better selling on e-bay and craigs list, but it was taking to much time. So i had to settle for what they offered only because of time constraints. But yes, I still think this place is cool!Spinato's deserves an A for effort, and might deserve more stars at some point, but they are just one of many pizza joints in N. Scotts so it's tough to stand out.  They sure are trying real hard, though.  

First, they put some effort into the decor.  Still looks like a pizza joint, but does have some modern italian touches.  I also like it that they have a lot of booths and patio seating.  

The help is super-de-duper happy and friendly.  I've only seen female servers so far, so on a busy all-hands-on-deck night it's a lot like walking into a sea of Stepford wives...or maybe cheer camp.  Or Fembots, all saying, "Hello, Mr. Powers" in unison.  I'm still trying to figure out if I like it, but that probably says more about me than them.  I can say I'd prefer they sacrifice a little of the cute factor in favor of more efficiency so the drink refills, timely food service and check are consistently on point.  

Spinato's pizza sauce is like none I've ever had. In a good way.  That sauce, along with their thin crust and cheesey goodness, makes for some fairly unique pizza.  Their salads - even the side salads - are by far the best I've ever had in a pizza joint.  You have a choice of spinach, lettuce or combo of both.  They always taste fresh made, and have lots of good veggies that are in good shape (you know, haven't been sitting around a while).  

Definitely worth a try.Went here for lunch and had the kafte sandwich stuffed in a puffed pita.  The sandwich was very tasty but I thought it was a bit pricey.
The service was VERY attentive - my waiter almost ran to the kitchen when he heard orders ringing for pick up.
I will have to go back and see what other meals they have, but I think the food would be good.  It's just pricey for what you get.  That is why I am giving it a 3 star rather than 4 star - value for the money.Good food at a great price. 

My husband and I split shrimp with brown rice in a honey glaze. We added some veggies and asked to have it all steamed. It came out yummy and plentiful for less than $12! We'll be back.I only went to Donovan's for a manufacturer dinner.  The food was okay, but nothing to write home about.  Everything was meat-heavy, which is to be expected of a steak house, but it left something to be desired for someone who eats vegan the majority of the time.  Good meeting space, nice house wine, and an averagely cooked piece of salmon -- no true vegetarian options were presented!  I won't be back!Ate there for the first time last week. Walked in and it smelt really good ad it was clean. Had good service, we received our food in a timely manner. And everything tasted really good, until a hair was found in one of the dishes. So we informed our waitress and she took the plate, it took her a couple min the come back and when she did she said we could choose something else and the manager Would take it off the bill. After that happened the service portion went down immediately. The manager never, not once came to the table to apologize, to reconcile the situation. After the waitress brought out the second dish she stayed away from the table, didn't even refill our drinks unless we caught someone walking by, and by the end of the meal she didn't even drop off our check she had someone else do it.
 I'm a firm believer in good service. Even if the Meal isn't that great service has the opportunity to make up for it. And they failed on that note.I went in for a double dip (Tanning bed + Spray tan) The lady at the counter was extremely helpful and welcoming. I found out later she's the owner. For a double dip it was 30.00 which is really reasonable. However, I don't think the spray tan worked AT ALL. The spray felt more like air then product. I told her and she adjusted the machine and back in I went. The 2nd time it was a little better, but honestly I still don't think it worked. I was in a hurry and instead of saying that yet again, it didn't work - I just told her it was fine. When i was leaving she told me the spray booth hadn't been used in over a month. Hmm - that might be the problem? Anyway, I didn't have any color the next day. Very dissapointing.Unfortunately, today was the last day for the $2 6" subs. We bought 4 6" for less than $11 -- not bad. I don't really like subway but this was an exception. I wish they had more choices especially for veggies. There was a new girl there so the line was kind of held up but that's okay. The cashier guy was kind of funny; gave me a chuckle on the way he was responding to his manager.Picazzos is not very big and was filling up fast by the time we left. There is indoor seating, outdoor seating and a bar area. No exciting decor. Looks just like your standard Italian eatery.

This place prides itself on  it's organic and local ingredients. Which is great, but the price definitely reflects this. 

According to our server, both the regular crust and marinara sauce are 100% dairy free, so I did a create-your-own pizzza with veggies and non-dairy cheese (I believe they use Daiya).

The pizza was good, but not amazing. I like a lot of Daiya on my pizza, so when I go again I'll definitely ask for extra. Also, I ordered spinach on my pizza and I felt that the spinach wasn't fully cooked, just a little wilted. I like my spinach fully cooked because I feel that adds more flavor, but that's a personal preference.

Our drinks took a while to come out, and for what we ended up paying we didn't get a heck of a lot. I'll definitely be coming back soon and see if I can't get them to veganize one of their specialty pizzas.Friendly employees, convenient location and open 24 hours. 

I fill my prescriptions here. Kind of slow in the pharmacy, even though they're auto refilled each month.

A heads up on their new policy: As I learned in April before surgery, if you have a prescription for a controlled substance, Walgreens will have to call your doctor to verify exactly what it's for. Think they said it takes 24-48 hours. 

Psst, if you're in a bind like I was: Hit up their competitor across the street. They don't have this type of policy. 

Thanks for ruining it for everyone, ya RX Smack Addicts! 

Also love that there's a Redbox here.My friend picked up 3 pizzas for pick up recently and I am torn between giving this place 3 and 4 stars.   Here's why.  It is based on structural integrity of the pizza, taste, and presentation.  We ordered the garlic, olive oil, basil, Romano, and mozzarella pizza.  The flavor of this pizza was quite nice, what it failed on was presentation.  None of the toppings were evenly distributed, and looked liked it was just flopped on the top, disappointing.  

   The next pizza we had was the Margherita.  The flavors were good, but again the toppings were just flopped on top.  The last pizza we had was the Italian sausage, caramelized fennel, roasted red peppers, and fontina.  My complaint about this pizza is that the dough is too thin to support the toppings.  Taste was there but you couldn't pick up the slice, it fell apart.

   With all that being said, I enjoyed the taste and all but I think if they focus a little more on execution, the pizza would be a lot more solid.On one hand, every single time I go here for Sunday brunch it is AMAZING. On the other hand, each time I come here for weekday lunch i am disappointed. For example, last time I came I ordered the lunch quinoa stuffed peppers. It came out not fully cooked and cold throughout. I wanted to return it to have it heated up more, but they service was so slow I didn't see our server again for at least 40 minutes. I ended up being forced to eat my half cooked, cold stuffed peppers. Then, when I was in a hurry to return to work our server was again nowhere to be found and what should have been a 45 minute-hour long lunch was easily 1.5 hours.I work right by this place and have tried it a few times.  The food is good, especially the Transplanted New Yorker (or something like that). BUT, I have to say, its overpriced.  $9.00 for a sandwich and tiny bag of chips is too much in my opinion, so I won't be going there too often.  That's a shame because the food is quite good.I know gluten free food isn't always the most flavorful but I have to say I did not find the gluten free pizza to be appetizing at all. Not only did I not like the taste, it actually made me sick to my stomach! Now I must admit the salads are pretty good - I like their wedge and the Italian chopped salad but I am not a fan of the pizza...Came here and grabbed some dinner with my man. I had a cup of chili and he had a cup of cream of chicken. I loved my chili, great flavor and texture. Nice and chunky, full of meat beans and just enough spice to get your nose running. The cream of chicken did not fare as well, it was bland at best. To give you a good idea of how our 'fine dining' went down, the cream of chicken now sits cold and half eaten, while the chili cup is wiped clean.

The convenience was easily the primary reason we decided to go to AJs. We grabbed our grub and headed home. There was a lot to choose from, we'll most likely come back and try more dishes.I only come to this Safeway if I am needing one item and I am around the area.  It is small and dark.  I like that they have a gas station, gas is cheaper than then Safeway at the Summit.Good, solid slice pizza but a bit pricey. This is my second time eating here, both times were good. Crust is very good, however the sauce was a bit bland this time. One other thing, I asked for tomatoes and they put raw, diced tomatoes on top (the kind you would expect on a taco) rolling off the edge of the pizza - bad idea. Still, this is a step up from Ray's or Barro's if you're in the mood for a slice. But I still think the best sliced pizza in the area is AJ's.I went here for the 1st time today because I was craving some Japanese curry rice so I ordered the island chicken curry. I was truly disappointed because it wasn't a Japanese style chicken curry that I'm  used to getting in other Hawaiian bbq joints. It tasted ok though....it was bbq chicken thighs with a curry flavor along with chunks of carrots and potatoes. I was really wanting the curry gravy to mix with the rice, but it didn't have any gravy :( Other than that the menu had all the items you would expect like kalbi, bbq chicken and beef, fried seafood, noodles, salads.Took a crack at the 2 for $20 menu with yet another date. The bill would have been nice, but she had to order two Long Island Iced teas that were about $9 each. I'm suggesting a 2 for $10 drink menu for this chain. I will give the place credit though as beer (large bud light drafts) are just 3 bucks. The place was pretty packed at 7pm ish when we arrived, but was full empty 90 minutes later as we left. The mozzarella sticks are always a safe bet here and her chienese chicken salad entry looked very average with salad mix and fried chicken topping. The three cheese chicken penne was good initially, but I may have left the leftovers in the car too long and the next day it might not have been a good idea to eat them. Applebees could expand the 2 for $20 with more entree choices as well. Solid waitress, but due to date's selfishnness, bill was $50, new chain record.I had gone to two different general physicians before finally being referred to Dr. English for a skin diagnosis. Dr. English was very quick and informative - he was able to quickly diagnose my condition, though I felt he slightly rushed through my appointment. All in all, he diagnosed my condition and this is all I wanted. The outside staff was impersonal, but the experience itself was bearable and I'm happy to have been properly diagnosed.Convenient location. It's right across from Sprouts so works great as my fall back for items that are too expensive or not available at Sprouts. I haven't bought much in the way of produce from here but their meats are always at a good price and their dairy section is well stocked.In all the years I've lived in the 702, I've stayed at the following hotels: The Palms, Gold Coast, South Point and the dingy motel extension of the El Cortez(which has been changed into the El Cortez Cabana Suites).

Boring. :P But I digress.

The room: Very nice and large. It was almost the size of a suite. The bed was so comfy that I wanted to take it home with me! I also liked how the toilet and bathtub were in a separate room from the sink area.
Location: I don't know about now(I rarely ever venture anywhere south of Tropicana to be honest) but back then it was surrounded by absolutely NOTHING. The bleak, middle-of-nowhere location seriously creeped me out, no lie. I don't know what it is about being somewhere in the middle of nowhere that bugs me so much.
Restaurants: The buffet was mediocre to point of it being overwhelming. It reminded me of The Orleans, but worse. I did like the Cafe though(can't remember the name) and Baja Miguel was just okay. 
Entertainment: The movie theater was decent(I saw Scary Movie 4 here) and I really liked the arcade too. Bowling alley looked nice but I didn't try it out. 
Pool: They hadn't finished construction on it at the time we stayed here.
Miscellaneous: The whole entire place is very.....plain. :/ It's nice, but other than that there's really nothing special about it at all. Rumor has it Flavor Flav comes here a lot, which is pretty damn random if you ask me.

So overall it's a decent hotel for your money if you don't mind being sort of isolated. There was a shuttle to The Strip that came and went every 45 minutes, I'm not sure if they still have it though.undecided here. sort of a locals place since a ways off the strip however i have had absolutely zero luck gambling (that's why they call it gambling) and cannot seem to scare up a free drink anywhere. seems like a little older crowd. have seen it busy. have gone to several events here, good parking garage if the lot out front is full (and it usually is.) i guess the best thing about southpoint is they are the home of steak n shake....my favorite hb joint in the world (you gotta try the portabella and have a strawberry fudge shake.)Alright drinks, but they come out of a slushy machine so they are great for what they are...During my most recent Girls-Night-Out weekend in Vegas, I wanted to take my friends to Strip House because I had fell in love with the one in NYC. I now have mixed feelings. I am a steak lover. I have pretty much checked out the most popular steak restaurants and thought the steak at NYC Strip House was by far, top 3. The steak in LV was a bit tough for me (I ordered medium rare). The mac and cheese was too cheesy and a bit bland. The cream spinach side was way too salty. My pinot noir was great. My gf loved her lobster pasta (it was pretty good). The overall ambiance is nice, but our waiter lacked personality. He was so serious! Unfortunately, I'd rather go to S&W because the sides there are way better and the people are more down to Earth.We visited Balboa Pizza because we were in The District and I had a coupon. Good thing, too, because the prices are one or two dollars more than comparable items at other restaurants. This may not seem like a lot extra but it does add up.

At any rate, the dining area is small and there is no separation from the bar. So, if you want to talk to the other people at your table or have small children, do not visit on a game day. Other than that, the place is nice.

I had the All American Pizza Bread Sandwich (minus the roast beef and mustard but I added 1000 Island Dressing which I had not requested but was included on the plate) with french fries and a side of ranch dressing. The sandwich was great and the fries were good plus the portions of each were very large. My problem was the extra charge for fries instead of potato chips and the charge for the ranch - especially since I did not have the roast beef or mustard on the sandwich. I understand that the ordering system is all computerized and additions add to your bill while deletions do not deduct but and extra $2.50 - really? 

My husband had a pepperoni pizza. He said is was nice (as you know this is a compliment from him) and there were plenty of leftovers. The toddler also really enjoyed the pizza and fries.

Now, for the service - really not impressed. I am not sure if there was only one waiter or if the other server was so sneaky that I did not see them until the end of our meal. However, even if there is only one server, the dining area is tiny and he should not have had a problem taking care of the tables that were occupied. We had to flag him down for drink refills. You know this is a pet peeve of mine. He was busy cleaning all the tables around us with his head down, not glancing over to see if we needed anything. He was pleasant enough, just not very attentive. 

Overall, the food was good and the slow service was not a deal breaker. The prices, however, could be an issue. I do have a couple of more coupons so we will return and on Tuesday they have a 2-for-1 pizza deal which I will try. If you happen to be at The District, it is worth a try.Just got back from here were I got the Ultra Exterior wash.  There was a little more pressure during the sale than I would have liked, but the overall experience was good.  My car came out looking nice and I was happy with it.

It took a while as when I got there the pipes were frozen so they had to clean the car by hand with a power washer.  I will likely update after going there again.

The cafe was ok, but they loose a star for the coffee which tasted terrible and took them way too long to make.  The gelato is a nice touch in the summer I'm sure.

The 48 hour clean car guarantee is nice too.  It may come in handy with the odd rains we have been getting.This place is bizarre. Emphasis on the "Experience" part of Fremont Street. Arrived to see the ceiling playing a movie about CG aliens allegedly attacking Planet Earth. But thank the heavens, Vegas is still standing.

Walking down the street, was accosted by a George Bush impersonator who said my boyfriend looked like Kid Rock (eww) and smelled cannibus all over. Wouldn't be surprised if I could also have scored some crack somewhere around here.

The yard-long drinks that places purported to sell for cheap seemed to just be gimmicky, non-alcoholic slushies.

Spent about 30 minutes here before asking myself what was going wrong with my life, and leaving for the Forum shops at Caesar's-- a little bit of designer fashion to wash off the filth of Downtown Vegas. Ew.

Park at Binion's-- the parking validation machine is right by the cashiers. Yay. Free parking.OMG. I was there last April and that place is so damn funny.  The people are a total trip to watch.  My friend wanted to get those stupid mardi gra beads at the various spots you collect them from.   The food was weak at the rinky casino we had to eat at, but  late night (11pm I think / isn't the town 24hr?) the places started to close.  The over head show was cool, but you have to go just to watch the peeps.Food - 4.5
Ambience - 3
Service - 3
Value - ?This is one of those places you drive past for years and keep saying one day I want to stop off and check the place out.  Well, that day (or night) finally happened.  But it took a Tower of Power tribute band named East Bay Grease to do it.  

My girlfriend and I met our friends in the bar the night of 02/28/11.  The bartender was cute, friendly and promptly brought over our drinks.  My buddy ordered scotch on the rocks and though he didn't complain, the glass was 100% ice with very little scotch.  I ordered a beer - $3.50.  Noticing ash trays throughout the bar, I inquired whether or not cigar smoking was allowed.  I was informed yes by the bartender.  I took out my Arturo Fuente and lit up.  A few enjoyable puffs and 5 minutes later, I saw the familiar whispering and gesturing.  The bartender came over and told me she was just talking to the owner who said cigar smoking was NOT allowed.  Gee - that's why I asked first.  Interesting that the owner himself didn't come up to me.  

Shortly before the band started to play, I asked the bartender to order us some spinach/artichoke dip with chips.  It never arrived.

I grew up listening to Tower of Power and I must say that this tribute band was spot on.  They played all my old favorites over the course of two sets.  I was totally surprised at the lack of people - I counted less than 20.  Despite the fact of the place being so cold inside, this was a totally enjoyable evening.  In my younger years, I used to frequent establishments like this all the time so it brought back some good memories.  I will also be on the lookout for more performances by East Bay Grease.

I noticed slot machines at the bar - but since they don't allow cigar smoking I'll have to gamble elsewhere.  But I will certainly return to watch more great music.Had pizza, wings, and bread delivered to our hotel.  Food came fast and hot.   Only complaint, which is a BIG complaint, NO plates or napkins.  Guess they thought we had are own in our suitcases.I'm glad I waited to write this review because of the inconsistency of this place. I've been there and wanted to give them 5 stars and then felt the complete opposite on other visits. The service is usually decent, good if you get the cute Russian chick with the accent- she's always on point.  I've had better experiences with their dine in over their delivery. And as many have said, it's true, the pizza is just so-so. 
A couple of my choice options are as followed: The Diablo pasta. With or without added chicken or sausage this dish is by far my favorite. It's linguini with a spicy red sauce with chunks of all types of onions and peppers. It's not for the people who order mild wings. This dish (if done right) usually has me sweating and downing the nearest liquid. Now I say if done right because again I must stress the inconstancy. I've had it unbearable hot, and then I've had it where I'm wondering if I ordered the right dish. 
Another plus on this menu is the salads. I enjoy them. Greek or buffalo chicken to be exact. Good dressings and ingredients. My last fav is the cheese fries add jalapeño. This channels my inner fat kid and I find myself getting full sometimes after I realized I ate an entire order before a meal. 
I'd pass on their Alfredo, it's not bad just I've had and made better. Also I prefer their hot subs over the cold. As much as I want to be mad at this place when they screw up, I continuously find myself coming back. Again, and again. 

PS there's always cops here.Ugh,...

So it's an OK bar and restaurant. BUT if you have minors joining  you and aren't able to sit in the cigarette stank area, then you must enjoy yourself inside the 'restaurant' area of the joint that is NOT enclosed... So it STILL reeks of cigarette stank, yep.

So came here bc the hubs heard through the grape vine that this was a Chicago friendly/supported bar, with the Bears in the playoffs we decided that we'd check this place out. My initial feel impression of the place was pretty good, that was, until I spent a few hours here.

Well, to start, a sports bar these days (YEA, so I run the risk of sounding like a sports bar SNOB, but oh well, how the heck else are you going to get my point ;) have NICE TVs. I mean you can have the old TVs, but can you at least make it so that I can see the dang score when I'm standing right in front of the TV?! They have these, probably 20" tvs so high up that I can barely see what the heck is going on in the game. Gees, my husband and I were sharing my glasses, LOL we share the same prescription LOL. It was a pain to watch in the dining area.

Burgers named after a few well known mobsters. They had a Chicago Dog on the menu, so I had to give it a try. I'm not from Chi-Town, but I love the dog. They made me hate their version of it. The bread was hard, the dog was pretty salty and everything went every where since the bread couldn't hold it all in.

This was our first time here, and we never returned. If I feel like going home smelling like I just walked out of a casino, then I'll go to a casino.Being one of the few places nearby that I can take my company car to get service, I've had good service and not so good service here. They have the usual service options for an oil change, tune-up, full service of the vehicle, or just to check your tire pressure.

It usually takes about 30-45 minutes to get a full oil change/fluid change and last time I went I had to get my air filter changed as well. If you go when it is busy, they say the wait can be upwards of 2 hours so I usually try and come back when it's not as busy. They are pretty nice about checking your tire pressure and filling it up for free (as they say you should check on a monthly basis).I took this cab service yesterday from my hotel to the Airport. The cab seemed a little old but was alright. The driver seemed liked a nice guy, but didn't really talk until I started a conversation.Stopped in here last week for breakfast and was disappointed. It is not the outstanding breakfast place that I was let to believe. The banana nut  muffin was not even close to those served by Mimi's.  Their omelet was not fluffy at all and fell short of those served by The Farm Aliante or the Cracked EggStayed here for a conference and was surprised on how nice the rooms where. We had two rooms right next to each other so were able to open the connecting door and it made the space so much larger. One room was much larger than the other one so it helped. Each room had one bedroom, one bath, living room, kitchen, and a balcony. 

The employees that helped us for the conference were great. Whatever we needed they got and were always laughing and smiling. Unfortunately the room we were in for the conference was skinny and long and was not perfect for the amount of people.  Also, we were told the lazy river would be open, nope!  Plus the spa says its open 24/7 and couple of the group went down and they weren't.  Maybe they need to change the signs the specify time because it is not correct.This was my first time eating at a CPK outside of California. The food and service was good.  Prices were set for Vegas so it's pricier than the CPKs that I have been to in Cali. There are plenty of other places to go to instead of here when in Vegas.  It just convenient when you're staying in the hotel.Is a fast food place, cant really say much about it
area was close to the strip and we just got off the plane and wanted something fast because we wanted to hit the casinos
so we drove to this sonic location
3 riced out miatas parked with locals having a cigs. bunch of characters so i kept an eye on them while we ate
gf ordered a regular cheese burger with tater tots
i had to finish the tots cuz she hates everything potato. not bad for tater tots
i ordered the new asiago fried chicken sandwich. didnt like the sauce that it came with because it just didnt go right with the sandwich
friend ordered a side of jalepeno poppers. the cheese was still running so that was a good sign but i wish they wouldve done something to the jalepeno because everytime i bit into one, i had to "fight" to bite the pepper in half
another friend ordered his favorite lemonade. i dont know what it is but he likes it
i also ordered the oreo shake. YUM!

cant complain, is fast food. havent had a sonic of a while so it was an A OK late night quick dinner

cool thing was ordering from outside through the speaker and sitting outside because it was a cool nightI want to start off by saying that this is really more of a 3.5 than a straight 3 (Silly Yelp and it's refusal to allow for half-stars...)

I really enjoyed our evening at Joe's. I had never had stone crabs, and the claws we ordered were good, and the dipping sauce was completely addictive.

I ordered the salmon au poivre, and it was truly lovely. The fish was perfectly cooked, and the fennel and radish salad was refreshing and the perfect complement to the salmon. Other dishes at our table included two filets (perfectly cooked and seasoned) and one liver-and-onions. There's not a lot to be done about the texture, but the flavor of the liver and sauce was nice.

We decided on the pan roasted sweet corn, cole slaw, and celery root au gratin for the side dishes. The best part of the corn was all the smokey flavor of grilled corn without all the crap that gets caught in your teeth. The cole slaw is bright and vinegary, something I appreciated since I don't love mayo. The au gratin was a nice change from potato.

We concluded our meal with a slice of the signature key lime pie, which had one of the best graham cracker crusts I've ever had. 

It was a nice meal, and everything was satisfying, so why three stars? Overall, it was a delicious meal, but a few things stuck out. For one, the crabs were great, but I'm not sure I felt like they were worth the $60. The au gratin was definitely under-seasoned, and I suspect that the pie was previously frozen because it certainly seemed frosty in the middle. Our server was nice, but he seemed to be reading from a script at times, and I was a little frustrated in his answers at points. 

I would consider coming back to Joe's, but there are other places I'd rather try in the meantime.I have dined at Mix many times with a friend of mine and loved it, so we suggested it for our mutual friend's birthday extravaganza. The evening did not start out as intended. First, you have to go on a scavenger hunt to find the hostess podium, why they hide it is beyond me as it makes perfect sense to have it out front and visible. After we checked in, we were seated in the middle of the dining room. Every other diner in the restaurant was seated with a view of the strip so we thought that was a little odd. Sure, we are young, but we were going to spend plenty of money considering the price of the entrees! So we asked to be reseated, since it was my friend's birthday we were hoping for a seat with a view, I mean that is the allure of Mix. We were immediately seated in a corner in front of the hostess podium, with a view of the Southwest, ummm OK? So we asked if we could sit outside instead. The hostess begrudgingly lead us outside and sat us in the far corner of the balcony, with a beautiful view of the airport. This seemed very passive aggressive to me and that belief was validated as she whispered into our waiters ear for a good few minutes, not even trying to hide the fact that she was clearly talking about us. We seriously almost got up and left, as there are plenty of other fabulous dining options in Mandalay Bay. Now, I agree that we may have been a pain, but the restaurant was nearly empty and there were plenty of tables open on the balcony the entire time we dined, so it was not like the place was packed and we were demanding a specific seat. Also, the strip celebrated Earth hour, so it was really cool to see all the lights go out on the strip, of course we had to stand and peer over the railing since we were still in a corner, but we definitely enjoyed the view. Overall, this was really a sour start to what was supposed to be a fun evening.

The food at Mix never disappoints and it shouldn't for the price. You always start out with a selection of fresh baked breads, so many delicious choices it's hard not to fill up. I always get the braised Wagyu beef and I am always happy with it. It is served in a cute little pot with a delicious braising sauce, carrots, mushrooms, and pearl onions. It is fork tender and a nice size for the price. I shared a bite with everyone and they were all very jealous! I also tried a bite of my husband's ribeye and my friend's venison, which were both delicious. We always get a side of mac and cheese with ham, which is always a creamy and delicious winner. We tried the fries as well, they had a weird seasoning on them, but worked when I dipped them in the Wagyu gravy. They also serve a complimentary Madeleine pastry at the end of the meal, which is lemony and delicious. I definitely appreciated that they brought them out with a happy birthday plate and a side of Nutella for our friend, it was the least they could do after how we were initially treated. 

Overall, I love Mix, but will think twice after this debacle. They have a fabulous view and fantastic food, but nobody likes a pretentious and unfriendly start to their meal. Our evening would have been 100% better if it had started with a smile and a warm greeting, nobody likes to feel like a pain, change the attitude Mix and you will have a packed house every night. It seriously pains me to give you 3 stars since I truly believe that the food is 4 star, but I can't ignore how we were treated.I admit it, one of my guilty pleasures is fast food.  I try my best to stay away from these joints, but I can't help it every once in a while.  This Jack In The Box location is most convenient because it's a few blocks away from my house.

I like coming here because it's at the gas station I use the most and the drive thru is usually pretty fast.  The food is always hot and fresh and I've never had any issues with taste.

My most recent visit, I ordered a Big Cheeseburger and a Bottle of Water.  Simple order, but one of my fav's.  It was as tasty as a JITB Burger can be.  It did the job.....filled my tummy.

Will I return?  Unfortunately, yes.Stopped here for a late night bite. The chicken fingers were decent. Had a breakfast plate that was kinda bland. Decent service and atmosphere though.Place was pretty decent. Not top notch but good enough for me to want to come back. I've tried better I can tell you that. Came here late night, and usually late night sushi doesn't taste as fresh as lunch sushi, but I can tell you that the sushi tasted as fresh as can be. Ordered the lasagna roll and the spicy crab. Both were good, but the lasagna roll was awesome.The food was good, but I order an appetizer and they brought it out with my food. I expected or receive my appetizer before I my maine meal. Over all had fun I only gave 3 stars because it's an average place to eat nothing special.Nice place to hit while in Vegas. Cool hookah prices the flavors are good. Nice drinks.It's dairy base. It's creamy for nonfat frozen yogurt.
You pick your size, the flavor , then the many many toppings. 
It's about 3 dollars a cup w/ toppings...
Their flavors change weekly, i think. Or monthly. 
I do like how the employees wash their hands each time b4 waiting on the customers. 

It's ok. good enough to satisfy the cravings.Having read the solid reviews, I was looking forward to staying at the Trump for a girls weekend Vegas trip.

Here is the good and bad:

Good 

- Lobby was swanky, quiet and smelled like delicious flowers! (not disgusting smoke like 99% of the other hotels)
- We were given water bottles while standing in line to check-in (even though there were only 2-3 people ahead of us)
- The DOUBLE SHOWERS and ginormous bathroom for the one bedroom suite
- Fully stocked kitchen that we sadly did not get to take advantage of
- Great service throughout the hotel
- BEST ROBES ever! So velvety and soft :)

Bad 

- Cheap/thin glass windows. All of us could hear the damned freight train every single morning at 8 AM. We could also hear the sirens from an ambulance and music starting at 8 AM as well. UGH! Thank goodness I brought my ear plugs because I've read many reviews about the noise level. 
- Frayed carpet and dirty smudges in the front entrance area. For a 5-star hotel, I would expect better up-keeping than that.
- SEE THRU bathroom doors. Seriously? Do I need to see my friends take a pee?!
- Not so comfy beds. The sheets and pillows were nice but the bed was pretty firm/hard. I was expecting a more luxurious bed. 
 
All in all, the Trump is a decent stay to stay if you don't mind hearing train sirens at 8 AM and being off the strip. I was hoping to give it a higher rating but unfortunately I didn't find the hotel that exceptional. For my next trip, I plan on staying on the strip so things are more accessible and I'm far away from the damned train.Luxurious atmosphere, however breakfast choices are limited and service not great.   Would benefit from having daily menu specials...My boyfriend and I have had some good times here. It's definitely a dive bar but we can play pool and darts, and the crowd is typical for a dive. Service is good, tons of tv's and bands on the weekends. Food is not amazing. Drinks are strong and happy hour prices are great.For a mall food court option I have to say Crazy Crepes is pretty good. I like them. I mean they must be doing something right to keep a business going in a place that must have exorbitant rent.

I like my crepes with ice cream, Nutella, chocolate sauce and whipped cream. It's very sweet. It's supposed to be very sweet. I think I may have been here over a half dozen times in the last year. I usually get the same thing. I think my bf has tried ever other sweet concoction they have on the menu. Every one of them was a hit but I think he liked the Nutella and bananas the most.

As for the service, I really couldn't say. It's food court restaurant in a mall. The cashier takes my order and my crepe gets delivered. Their attitude may not be the "most bubbly smiley" service ever but I don't think I've ever experienced any rudeness.Officially called "Pho at the Coffee Shop" inside Treasure Island. My friends and I wanted something warm after the clubs and were too lazy to wander the strip. Since we were staying at TI, we decided to just eat here... Pleasantly surprised!

I was expecting the pho to be decent at best (because really... pho in a casino?), but it was actually pretty good! #14 is your typical combo pho bowl with everything included. Tasty broth, flavorful tendon and meat, a couple squeezes of lime and I was a happy camper in my little black dress.

Yes, it's double the price ($14.95 for my combo bowl), but it's Vegas. Get over it or stock up on McDonald's before you go out.Dub-step hipster bar - maybe I am getting too old for this stuff, but after a few drinks and some fun girl date company it wasn't so bad, especially since this is not my scene. The roof dance floor with projector screens of trippy colors made the whole thing as well as the hipster sightings.Do I love this place? No.
Do I hate it? Not quite
Do I find it mediocre to switch things up a bit? Hell yes.

some restaurants get old after awhile day after day IMO.
we came here to get burgers(i would not trust getting Chinese or "wok" inspired dishes from an Americanized fusion place. If I want good Chinese or whatever I will go to where the goodness is really at. Which is NOT here. After not eating all day I ordered the Santa Barbara burger with regular french fries. ehhhh....Nothing amazing. Not much flavor the chefs got the color completely on point though as far as medium rare which is not usual for my luck. I ordered it with no onions and its a damn good thing i am not allergic. Because there was definitely onion on it.  Hidden below the patty sneaky bastards.  Trying to kill me or something. Geeze!  I ordered a weird concoction of a drink (half club soda/lemonade)(Woot DD!) and i had to search high and low as I sat stuffing my face with my burger and hoping to god she would hurry up and get to our area so I can wave her down for a refill. 
One thing I happen to love dearly is when I do NOT have to wave down a waitress to refill a drink. Especially if refills are free!  I swear they do it on purpose to not come around so they do less or they are doing way too much and have too much area to cover.  Will I go back?  Sure i guess. Not by my choice though.I'm torn with this place.  The room itself deserves a 2 star but the casino deserves a 4star! sooo i had to compromise the two and give it a  3!!  The hotel is beautiful inside.  I truly like the decorations etcetc.  The rooms though are disgusting.  It has the remains of the old aladdin and it isnt pretty or nice at all.  Plus the bathrooms were horrible...so many of us girls were trying to brush our teeth at once so some of us used the bathtub!! too bad the drain didnt go down..sooo ew.  The sink spurted out in diff directions and pressure was so low it was crappy.  HOWEVER i LOVE the casino!! I thought it was soo pretty and okay i may b bias but they have the wheel of fortune!!!!!!!!!!!!! the round one not the regular looking slots. MY FAVORITE!! sooo  I was there for the remainder of our non clubbing nite =).  Prettty hotel...nasty rooms...booo!!I've had the pleasure of meeting perhaps 300 customer-facing professionals in Las Vegas. Fewer than 5 were anything but impeccably courteous. (Rudeness simply won't fly in a CRM-driven industry, especially in a down economy, because there's a glut of labor supply and a dearth of demand.) Surprisingly, the rudest of them all was at PH. The sum of all customer touch-points = brand. Maybe PH needs the old Keith Ferrazzi (former Starwood CMO) touch back to remind them how it's done.

That said, PH is conveniently located center-strip and an easy shot down the Palms axis. I stayed here a couple times because of its connection to Cinevegas. It's clean and modern, and the vibe is fun and young.

Unless you've got comp'ed rooms or are staying on SPG points, the cheapest inventory (and I mean, crazy cheap) is to be had on hotwire; know that you're getting PH by using http://www.betterbidding.com/Pros:
Great location. 
Good food.
Convenient shopping.

Cons:
Mediocre pool.
Mediocre rooms.
Dirty bathrooms.

The price was pretty good considering that we were here during a holiday weekend. That's all I have to say. I will not be staying here again.I heard about this place from a friend, and during my last trip to Sin City, made it a point to come here.  

Got here around 8:00, and waited about 15 mins, which was not bad at all considering I normally wait around 2 hours at Boiling Crab.  

Once we were seated, we ordered sweet potato fries,  the fried catfish basket, 1 pound of crawfish, 2 pounds of shrimp, both with the Hot n' Juicy sauce.  

The hot and juicy sauce lacked flavor, we literally had to add salt to it  to liven it up.  The sweet potatoes fries were not crispy, and the catfish had way too much batter.

Eh , maybe I came on an off day, but I am willing to give this place another try.in the land of chocolatey goodness, ethel's chocolates sits right in the middle ground. it's definitely tastes better than store bought chocolates like hershey's or what not, but lacks the sophisticated and complex tastes that you might get at places like l'artisan in l.a. or vosges in ceasars palace. perhaps the best equivalent i can think of is see's candies.

the store itself is cute with little sitting areas for you to enjoy hot chocolate and other drinks. the display counter has a myriad of chocolates to choose from. when i was there last, i chose a caramel and toffee in milk chocolate and a truffle. each piece cost $2, but there is a "deal" when you get a box with a set number of pieces.

i wouldn't go out of my way to get chocolates here. i think with all the interesting flavor profiles that are being created by so many chocolatiers, ethel's chocolates would benefit from being a little more experimental themselves.Service was good. Clam chowders are delicious but oysters were a let down. They were different sizes and flavors. I also wouldn't order the crab legs.  They were pretty average. There is a dish (called roasted crab with sauce?) that is very good.  I would recommend that and the chowders.Went there and the food and service were good.
But I felt screwed when I saw a Pasta plate and they were charging $13.95 for it. I asked them if I could get the pasta plate and add Chicken and they said sure .....no problem.
Well... the bill came and they charged me $32 for just the Friggin Pasta.
I complained from the server to the Boss.
He was an Asian guy that said he'd payed over $32 for pasta before...
BF deal....
I said that I should have been told that it was going to be 32 and not 13 and it should have been my decision to spend $32.
It's a little short sited on there part.
The bill was $138 dollers.. 
Normally I would leave about a $35 tip on that amount.
I left them with no tip and saved the $35.
The only one that suffers is the poor waiter.
WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND ZEFFIRION'S .....IT'S A RIP-OFF!!!!!Napoleon's Dueling Piano Bar
Overall
3.75

Gold Medal - Extraordinary Pianist
Silver Medal - Peppy Fun Environment
Bronze Medal - Free entrance

These pianist knows every song!  From Journey to Metallica.  Truely amazing.

There were people singing, dancing, and drinking.  People were having the time of their lives.

This is a free activity at night.  There is no admission fee and no drink minimum. Unlike comedy improv shows, where you get in for free, but the waitresses are hounding you for drink orders, causing you to miss the entire show. Here at Napoleon's, you pay for what you want to order.  If you want to request that special song that makes your body alive, you pay a tip with the name of the song written on a piece of paper.

The crowd was mainly 40 years old+.  All the younger hipsters are probably out hitting the dance clubs.

HAPPY DUELING!!Great food, great service, great HH. Don't go too often though.Great food, but the service is extremely, extremely (yes,  double word is deserved) slow.  I ordered a drink, and the service was so slow at the drink actually showed up after the check. The drink was ordered with dinner!Sitting in this place makes me think of eating on the set of Seinfeld. I literally felt like I was in NYC having a snack at an old school jewish cafe. It's busy and everyone there was in their own little world. Either reading the papers, catching up with friends or stopping by to pick up deli meat, this place is worth checking out. However, if you came here for the bagels, fo'get about it, there are better things to have then the bagels. I was super stoked to check out this place but I have to say, I was a little disappointed. 

The food is good. It's not amazing, its good. The service honestly, could be a lot better. I like sarcasm, I don't like to be patronized. I get it, you want people to feel like you're in NYC, but I still like good service, at any restaurant. I like the overall atmosphere. If you're looking for a quick bite to eat or just a whatever place to have breakfast or lunch, this is the spot.  

They have a pretty big menu which is nice because it gives everyone an option. But, the one thing to have is the matzo ball soup. I've never had it before and I knew I had to try it. I can't imagine eating at any other place more Jewish than this. 

It arrives and it steaming hot. The steam alone had flavor. It was so delicious. This broth had to have been made by a 90 year old grandma in their kitchen. It's everything chicken noodle soup needs to be, plus the matzo ball. If I was ever sick, this is the soup that I would want, hands down. The flavors were intense and then subtle and then suddenly you're reminded of sitting in grandma's kitchen being served soup. Oh, just writing about it makes me want to have some.

If you save room, you'll find that this place has a great pastry shop. All the sweets are gigantic, so plan on sharing. The deli bar is okay. I've had better service and sad to say quality at my local grocery store. It's sad because people can have a much better experience if this place started looking at how the staff treats the guests.

Ciao and until next time, have eating everyone :)Had a craving for a bagel and lox this morning so I decided to stop in based on the yelp reviews. Ordered at the deli to go. Had a sliced and toasted everything bagel with lite scallion cream cheese and lox, plus a potato pancake and they threw in a pickle. When I got to the counter to pay? $15.17?! Wow, that's just crazy for what I got. Don't get me wrong, the bagel was delicious. But the price? Fuggetaboutit!Been here multiple times before. The most important memory: first time I ever had creme brûlée.

This restaurant is located in the Planet Hollywood Mile of Shops or formerly Aladdin hotel. It's strategically situated in the middle of that long streak of overpriced shops. All that walking gets my buddies and I hungry. What do we do? Eat at One Ocean.

The restaurant actually doesn't have many walls. Instead, large window spaces make the restaurant feel more open and spacious. A nice touch.

Environment: the open feeling of the restaurant is very welcoming. The place never really feels crowded although because of it's location and the setup, it's always loud. If that doesn't bother you, then have a seat and take a look at the menu. The decor fits the personality of the restaurant which is trying to pull off a casual but sophisticated look.

Waiters/waitresses: Our waitress did not go above and beyond the call of duty. She only came to our table to take our order, drop off food, drop off the bill, and pick up the bill. This was probably the worst part of this particular dining experience. Otherwise, there is nothing that really stands out about this employee.

Food: had the half pound sirloin steak burger. The patty was cooked medium well (no pink) and was covered with melted provolone cheese. In addition, it was topped with the normal staple of lettuce, tomato, and raw red onion slices. All together, this was pretty tasty. It had the distinct flavor of a home made hamburger prepared with fresh beef. The restaurant was a little stingy with the steak fries. It didn't look as if they were seasons but a hint of garlic was evident.


Drinks: only water. Sorry.

Recommendation: EAT!This place isn't too bad ... it's your standard burger joint with slightly elevated prices for a normal burger spot, but just about right for being on the strip.

Had the Blue Cheese Burger and Fries/Onion Strings Combo .. Beef was cook medium like I ordered and tasted fresh. Fries were ok - standard. Onion strings were good - they're very thin and a good change from normal onion rings but on a normal day i think i would prefer normal sized onion rings.

GF had the veggie burger that she liked very much. Tasted good except the patty wouldn't really stay together and was falling all over the place so it's more of like a veggie mush. 

Overall 3 stars just cause it's a decent burger spot, but nothing too special compared to Fuddruckers or any place like that.Convenient if you are staying at Paris or Bally's (it is in between).  $11 burgers don't come with fries so it is a bit spendy. That said, they have a large assortment of burgers, beef, chicken, lamb, salmon, veggie and tons of toppings.

I had the veggie burger topped with spinach and brie. I added a side of fried for $3.99.

Good, friendly service. Bar is convenient for dining alone.Hidden in the shops by the Paris casino, this sports bar has a lot to offer. The drink specials were good, one came with an orchid and tasted great. The burgers here can be personalized to your liking and are not too expensive. One of the better burgers I had in Vegas but not the best .Not bad for a grocery store. It's much better than Ranch Market or Food City. Safeway is comparable to Fry's.After calling several nursery's in the valley, one referred me here. I was looking for a  bonsai tree.  The one place that sales it in the flea market was sold out. So instead I purchased a money tree plant and some lucky bamboo. Other then that, I really didn't pay attention to anything else. (The lady didn't tell me how to care for the money tree, so I called my pops for him to tell how to care for it since he is a plant freak.) I will only return here for plants.My man and i went there to do some gambling and we were doing pretty good.  We didnt experience the thick cloud of smoke that was before mentioned.  $5 crap tables were def nice to find on the strip.

Saw the Big Elvis show, considering it was free it was worth seeing.  He sounds just like The King.

This a no frills - old fashioned casino.Love the Chinese Chicken Salad and Dumplings!! Been dining at CPK chains since I was introduced to it in the 90s at the Beverly Center CPK. I've always had good service so no complaints here. 

A full bar which stocks the Malibu for those rare occasions where I actually drink at CPK!Its cheap, greasy and fast.... I don't understand the rage that makes it so popular. The burger seemed so ordinary, and the fries were good but nothing to write home about. I ordered a double cheese "animal style" and it was fine. It was fast and affordable but unmemorable. I just don't get it. Its not as if I don't like the place, but my sales manager about pissed his pants when we spotted the restaurant. If he is happy, I'm happy.Stopped here after taking in a Oakland A's spring training game. Its a cool looking rock that looks like it belongs on Mars or something. The whole time I was in Phoenix I wanted to do a hike, but mostly all I did was drink and watch baseball so I'm glad the old lady made a detour over here after the game. I kind of wish it was more strenuous. It looks bigger and taller than the path is. But I guess its just as well as I had several beers prior to making the ascent. Anyways, if you find yourself in Phoenix, check this place out. Its pretty cool. Free parking.The show was primarily tumbling, with a yo-yo act thrown in. It's family friendly, and a decent way to spend the afternoon. The performers gave 100% and I was entertained, but I wouldn't rank this as a must see.Deli and cakes were alright, but the highlight here is the sliders. Get the slider appetizer with any other meal, and it'll be worth it.Ok but not very flavor full. Good service good view mediocre food at best.This is a great escape from the heat and endless art galleries in town. I was initially the only customer in the whole place...I suspect that others, as I did, had difficulty finding the place, which seems odd considering what a large building it is in! There is a large lot and some kind of statue-art piece that obscures the view of the building from the main part of town and it is tucked behind the strip of galleries...

It is beautiful inside and the customer service was excellent. The wine was okay, the strawberries with mascarpone & chocolate infused wine were amazing! 

I think it is weird that they make their wine from grapes imported from other places. I asked if they had anything from Arizona and was informed they "bring in the best grapes from California and import from various regions overseas." I was disappointed because Arizona has some great wine country and I expected a Winery that "makes wine on site," and is based in AZ to have some local grapes involved.My boyfriend suggested going here and I'm glad we did.  The food was really good!  I keep asking to go again but alas we have not.  It's kind of a long drive from where he lives so...I try to limit my marketing to Arizona markets (Sprouts, Basha's, AJ's) but I needed wine and Total Wine had already closed so I had no choice but to pop in here.

It's clean, good sized and they have a nice deli section. Their wine section is respectable enough, and I got a good bottle of Pinot Noir at a good price with my Safeway Club card. But I was jonesing for a red from South Africa or Central Otago so I was disappointed but not surprised.This place actually deserves 3 1/2 stars.  I went to the one located on Tatum Blvd.  It use to be some other kind of restaurant/game place before.  My husband and I met up with a big group that was visiting from out of town and it was great for that.  They have some good deal where you buy a dinner for a certain amount (i want to say $15.99, but don't hold me on it) and you get a $10 game card.  Not bad, especially if you have a lot of people into playing the games.  We also ended up in the bowling section and had a blast.  Wait staff good and attentive.  Also, a big plus about them...you don't feel like you're being police patrolled...or that someone is going to walk up to you in 5 seconds shining a light in your face with a Breathalyzer just because your on your second drink in an hour and a half.First time here? Free tamale y'all ! Green sweet corn...and it's huge. Yum. 

Very tasty prickly pear margaritas served in a very fun tall glass. Only place I've seen outside of Aqui that has this sweet little gem.

Steak salad had a ton of steak, and my hub liked his dish too. Quick service, cute patio...nice lunch. Surprising find in a strip mall. Fun way to start an anniversary mini-vacation.Sandwiches are ok, and prices are high. 

Yes, they are always open, so you can go their after a night of hard drinking, but the food is just ok. 

Earl Club Ok, Montague ok, Ahi Tuna is just a tuna sandwich you can make are home. Soup, straight from instant powder section. 

Friendly and fast service, but many places can fulfill this need. 

Overall, overrated.Food is sacred in certain cultures, just ask the French. In America, it is done differently.  It's blasphemous to eat certain SE Asian food alone, such as Thai & Lao food . It is best when shared and eaten in a communal setting,  this may help ease the political tension a lot in Thailand between the rural folks and bourgeoise city people. 

My group of 3 arrived on a rainy moonson day to chat work , Phoenix and talk about local SE Asian, Arabic, and Jewish food places found in beaten down strip malls where they usually tasted best. We examined the menu and concurred on the 3 dishes to share based on preferences for separate meat dishes and flavors for that overall balanced palette experience. Our food arrived in about 10 minutes; the pork larb, pepper chicken and pad thai..

The larb had pork that seem to have been grounded by the pottery " V bowl" ; very homemade. The dish though flavorful with garlic and spice seemed a bit dried and lacked the sauces that makes it a wonderful messy occassion that it should be. It looked like and tasted more like street food.  But we had no problem using our hands and dry rice to scope it up. 

The pepper chicken with broccoli was good. The pepper left an aftertaste and it felt right. However, the beef pad Thai tasted typically average like most other Thai place; nothing special about it. It had a lot more sauce and food coloring than I expected.  The most awesome attribute about most noteworthy traditional Thai and Lao places was that most dishes are about $10 and normally you have 3 people share 2 large oversize dishes. This place lacked this aspect as the 3 dishes we received for that price was an individual small portion size. We weren't provided extra individual plates or side rice bowls for each person. Afterwards, I think that was the design intent of this place.  The service was something you have to ask for though the young Thai lady was very nice server.Our group agreed that the food was good though not memorable; just could have more sauce and quantity compared to the other Thai places nearby.


The ambience is typical of a place that probably was a converted Dennis restaurant.  The restaurant is smartly located near Central Avenue and has plenty of back parking. The crowd was about a third capacity.

Despite some of the downsides I've mentioned. The food was tasty though I may be hungry still, but that is better than going to an Americanized Thai restaurant where I wouldn't have eaten much. Out of respect for the efforts to make these dishes, our group tipped properly and thank them.

What really helps this place is that it has a bar setting with television that invites one to come back again and eat a quick meal alone. This mitigates the blasphemy of appearing anti-social eating this type of food..This is a 3.5 star rating.  We just had an appetizer here before the elite yelp event at Gordon Ramsay Pub.  We sat at the bar, and were greeted immediately by a very friendly bartender.  I had a glass of pinot noir, which was $12 as I recall and very good.  The wine list was solid, and they had several selections of white and red by the glass.  We decided to split the antipasto.  It was $13.95 and comes with the usual suspects.  I would want more meat, there was probably only 2 ounces, maybe 3 on the plate.  I think they can add more meat and charge an extra $3 for it and this dish would be a winner.  The marinated artichokes were great, as was the basil leaf included.  Peppers were solid as well, but none were very hot.  I know that most people don't like them hot, but maybe they could offer you hotter peppers if you want them.  Which, I always do.  You do get 4 large pieces of mozzarella.  All in all, it was excellent service, and I think a couple of tweaks to the dish would make it a 4 star appetizer.  There were a couple of dishes on the menu that looked really good, so I imagine we'll be back.This is the first time for me at Big Al's... Believe it or not, I've passed by many, many times and little did I know what I was missing! Opted to sit at the bar and have my lunch. They have really friendly service here and that makes a lot of difference! I ordered the combination pan roast which has crab and shrimp in it. They are very generous with the shrimp. The broth was really smooth, although I would have preferred it to be a bit thicker. It was very tasty and it is served with rice pilaf. They also give you a basket of bread with your meal. Warning: don't fill yourself up on the bread because the portions are good sized!Some of my friends will hate me for this, but I just didn't find this one as good as my other cirque experience. As much as I love the Beatles and their music, there was no story line. Which I understand, it's a Beatles tribute and hard to put a story together based on their songs. But I guess I don't deal well with the abstract. I went in a group of 5 and some loved it, while others thought it was okay. I personally would have preferred more acrobats and less dancing, and maybe I would have liked it more if it had been my first cirque show. Who knows. A good show, but not sure it was worth my $123.Katrina L and I dined at the very same table and her dead-on coverage of Cien Agaves' strengths (recessionista-friendly) and weaknesses (atmosphere, "margs") has tempted me to chime in. The vibe here is pretty blah. If they invested a little in some art/curtains/less bright lights, I think this place could be considered a fun date place, as opposed to a destination for a grande groups.

Maybe my time back on the East Coast has made me desperate for any kind of edible Mexican, but I did enjoy the food. The queso was a huge hit (turns out chorizo in melted cheese can change lives) and the dos tacos especial (2 tacos- you can mix and match any from the menu + rice + beans = $8.95) made the menu muy caliente to me.This place is getting bad ratings. I have to admit, it is pretty good. Their chili dog was not that bad, although is was not healthy. I guess I was really hungry at the time. And their fries was awesome. One of the better fries I had in a long time. Price is a bit steep, oh well, your in vegas. Who cares. I came to realize that $20 is literally $1 out there. To me, thats a cheap dinner versus spending $60 plus on dinner.

Overall : not bad. chili dog $5.95
                                 fries $4.00Update: 
Was in again and the place was still being constructed.  Did talk to a manager that explained they had run into many issues in trying to open.  The Coffee drink I had was excellent.  I think with time they should get better.  Kinda like a good wine I guess.  I give them three stars hoping for the day they are finished and I can increase this to 5 stars.  There coffee drinks are very good.

First visit New place:

Hope they get it together but with experience today I have to give them one star.  Total chaos and the place seems along way from being in shape to open but they are open.  Construction stuff all over the place.  Scaffolding in front of pizza oven.  Not enough employee's to offer good service and they were not even extremely busy.  

Employee's they did have only one guy seemed to know what he was doing and how to do it.  He did make an OK Iced americano but no creamer containers only a coffee cup with lid full of half and half to help your self.  Asked for milk in my drink said it was serve yourself which is fine if they had it where I could serve my self.

Don't know who made the decision to open before they were ready at new location but Management needs to re-think there decision.  Open when you are put together!Too far from the strip :/It's an IHOP, so can't be too critical nor complimentary.

Granted I walked in around 10PM and the crowd was thin (3 tables)? There were only two waitresses working and they were both very busy but they still did a decent job responding to orders and requests.

The food, however, seems like a grease-fest. I ordered the steak and it wasn't cooked decently at all, just cooked.

Then again, we don't go to IHOP for a culinary journey, it filled the gut and that was it.

The food, I'd give it a 2 star, the staff a 3.5 or so.I was not impressed. The staff would leave bags of soiled linens out in the hallway for hours at a time, the room service food was absolutely terrible and overpriced, and my bed was slept in so much that it had a curve in it that made me feel like I was going to spill out of it. I expected much, much more from an expensive hotel.I like no extra charges for ANYTHING pickles, pepper, onions etc.I thought it was fine; we didn't have to wait to get in, and the drinks were standardly overpriced.  The people-watching, as it is in Las Vegas, was intense, and although we didn't stay long, I thought it was fine.  A bit of a walk from where we were earlier in the evening, but Eyecandy was a fun night out.Continuing on my "kid free" weekend, I went over ot Tempe Marketplace to return something at one of the stores there.  I suddenly realized that the only thing I had to eat was popcorn at the movie and that was over 4 hours ago.  So, I stated to think about what was at the Marketplace in terms of being "kid free" and having a decent dinner.  

I don't mind dining alone but on a Saturday evening when there are lots of families and dates going on, I'd rather not sit in the dining room alone so I bellied up to the bar.  It was pretty empty.  There was one other guy at the bar so I figured the bar tender would see me pretty fast.  Not the case, I waited about 5 minutes before I was acknowledged by someone other than the bartender.  I asked for some water and told him I was looking over the drink menu, not sure what I wanted yet.  Another 5 minutes went by and the bar tender came over, I ordered my drink and he asked if I would be having dinner.  I said yes so he got a menu.  I was somewhat taken aback by the prices.  I thought it was a tad bit expensive.  Since it was just me and I was giving myself a treat I thought, ok, just once.....unless it is just amazing bbq....you never know.  I finally made my decision and ordered 1/2 slab of baby back ribs.....it's bbq and that's usually how I gauge my bbq, by the ribs.  

My food came out piping hot.  The roll that was severed with the meal was flaky on the outside and tender inside.  The cinnamon butter was delish and a nice compliment.  I was never asked if I wanted another though.  I dug into the mac and cheese and it was hot and gooey with a nice flavor.  I got sweet potato fries too.....I know, I love carbs!  Wish I didn't but I don't have many vices.  :)  Those were tasty as well, hot and crisp. And now for the ribs. They were good.  Moist and tender, fall off the bone goodness.  The sause had a tiny bit of sweetness to it that I liked.  The Dbacks were playing the Dodgers and not doing so well so I took solice in my ribs.  

The atmosphere here is cute.  Down home southern style and comfy.  They had a blues combo playing in the bar and they were pretty darn good I must say.  The music made me feel better about watching the Dbacks loose to the Dodgers.  UGH!  

The service was just ok. Considering I was one of just two other people at the bar,   I could have been greeted faster.  I had a margarita that tasted a bit off to me.  And I felt that was pretty expensive too.  The food was good but for the price I can go other places and get something just as good.  In this economy I've got to save my pennies.  I also thought the service was lacking.  I would not have been pleased at all if I had been in the dining room.  But then again, one of two people at the bar and I wasn't greeted with a minute?  Not sure I will go back.....but thanks anyway.Went for breakfast, and it was around 13.00 per person. The buffet is average. You got your hashbrowns, biscuits, sausage, made-to-order omelette's and pancakes and waffles. They also have pastrys and cereal in the back. People never find that because its not connected to the main buffet. You might think its big, but its probably similar to a small breakfast buffet thing at any hotel like La Quinta. The food was good though, they just lost me at variety. Spend a few more bucks and head over to the wynn.It was show and dinner deal so I had no other option. It's a typical Vegas buffet. Line was fairly long for Wednesday evening (because of show and dinner deal I assume). Regular price was $25. Server brought my coke very quickly and checked on me for refills often. Sushi was not that good. Roast beef was okay. I tried their pasta station, it was cooked very good. Their pizza tasted okay. Desserts were good, homemade donuts was tasty and creme brûlée was very good, also had carrot cake. Finally server brought hot tea for me before I said goodbye. Manager was also walking around to check service, asked if I need anything, was nice of him. Good buffet but nothing spectacular. May repeat if I'm there again and very hungry.Nice atmosphere and a good value. Lacked in variety but everything was fresh and yummy.Three and a half stars maybe but at a high price.  So if you're stuck at Rio or seeing a show at Rio this place is a decent seafood option.  But I don't eat here anymore because there are much better seafood values around town.Not bad. Stopped in to grab some take-out Chicken Tikka Masala and Naan. The sauce was very good, as was the naan, but the chicken "felt" as though it might be under-cooked. I was surprised that I didn't get any rice or anything with the tikka masala, just a tub of chicken in sauce.

I'll happily give them another try though, when I have time to eat in.Onion rings and potatoe skins are amazing. I would enjoy this place more if the beer glasses were kept icy cold and if my glass was never empty. Servers seem to take their time to get to you with menus and drinksSo I got the chance to go back and do a full pie, salad, and cheesecake.  Alas, while the service, and owner were wonderful [as before]  if I have to get pizza, I will stick with Grimalde or NYPD for now.  Still have to visit 3 other high end pizza places, in Phx.

All food tasted good, and service was excellent, but can not do 4 stars, as its not GREAT.  Still very good, however.  Rocky on the DVD player was amusing!We came just as breakfast was ending and lunch was starting. We ended up eating both though since they hadn't cleared away the breakfast completely yet. Everything tasted pretty good and it's not as expensive as some of the other buffets. I thought the eggs benedict tasted a little strange, but I quite liked the waffles.Ouch - 2 stars seems a bit harsh.

We had the buffet at the Luxor on the last day of our trip for convenience as we would be leaving right after lunch.
Breakfast was probably the weakest showing, with limited options and underwhelming execution.  All the standards were available: Eggs, meats, breads, potatoes, pancakes, etc.  But nothing was awesome.  I'm a big biscuits and gravy guy, so when the biscuits were small and dry and the gravy didn't have much flavor, I was bummed.  Coffee was good though :)

Lunch was a bit of redemption.  Much wider variety:  Mexican, Asian, Pasta, Greek, American, etc.  Nearly everything I tried from the lunch buffet was tasty.  I specifically recall the vegetable spring rolls being really good.  The star may have been the dessert - Chocolate Molten Lava "cake", which was basically a pan of chocolate cake, fudge filling, graham crackers, and marshmallow.  
You can't beat the value and if you're looking to stick close to the Luxor, you could probably do much worse.The restaurant is still a fun destination for family events, birthdays, etc.   The food is pricey (about $25 a person) not including drinks,  but the portions are reasonably large.  Overall the  food on its own is a little bland tasting, but sauces are provided to experiment with.Cute place. The best thing about it was the staff- they were really cool and accommodating, especially given the annoying pseudo-yuppie Scottsdale crowd slumming it (yes there IS a wait, even for you!).

The food was edible, but honestly I can think of a dozen better places for breakfast. Its inexpensive, so it wasn't that upsetting that my chicken fried steak was of the frozen variety,and the gravy had this very strange gratuitous smoky porky flavor. Yes they do have good coffee, and fresh juice. All in all it was.....o.k. 

The most perplexing thing though- they serve everything in these tiny side dishes, which is not to say the portions are small, but the dishes are. You can't even see the plate for the food. I just wound up eating my steak off the counter-- thank god it was clean.

45 minute wait? Perhaps not.We're new to the area and was really looking forward to trying this place after seeing it on Triple D (gotta love Guy's job). We got there about 11:30 on a Sat. morning. There was a crowd gathered under an umbrella waiting for a table. We felt lucky as the gal at the counter told us that she found us seating inside. Turns out inside there were a grand total of two tables and counter space. Our party of four ended up at the counter facing the open kitchen of a converted Taco Bell setting. 

Overall, the food is pretty average. Had the french toast and my husband had the brioche with bananas. Hash browns were pretty good. Kinda hard to enjoy the food with the heat coming from the kitchen and not being able to enjoy my company. 

Yeah next time I'd even rather go to IHOP. At least there I can sit indoors at a real table.Not bad.  The dining room was cozy but not too crowed or noisy. The vibe here is more of a modern/fusion japanese restaurant  rather than a traditional sushi bar.
I ordered mainly nigiri (Toro, Hamachi, Sake, Ikura, and a spicy tuna roll to wash it all down)
Overall, the sushi was average in terms of freshness, flavor, cuts, and taste.  
appetizers are around 10-18
sushi runs around 5 - 18 for 2 pieces
rolls are all around 8-10 for starts.
Not sure if I would make a huge effort to return but if you're in the area and craving sushi this might hit the spot.  I don't get the 4-5 star ratings.  Perhaps this is as good as it gets for sushi in the Madison area.I  like Cartel's coffee. Really delicious.Came here for Restaurant week
Anchor Steam $7
Ketel One dirty martini $14
Old Cuban $13
Truffled Mac and Cheese $9

As everyone else mentions, their duck fat fries are a very nice touch, different than your usual bread.
BF had the pistachio crusted halibut which he loved (I thought it was lacking in... flavor). I had the filet, which was great!
For dessert I had the strawberry "cheescake", which I'm not sure if it's on the usual menu,but it was basically mascarpone cheesecake Filling, no crust, piped onto the plate in decorative little blobs.Though very small, it was delicious, reminding me my fat rear doesn't need a crap ton of sugar+fat for dessert. BF had the bourbon-y pudding dessert, which again, he loved.

I think it would be Underwhelming to come back and pay full price, but it's a good value during Restaurant Week.Not the best burger I've ever had, but a fun place to try with the coworkers on a Friday afternoon. I had the quadruple bypass and a few helpings from the all-you-can-eat fry station. Better than BK/McD's, but nothing to write home about. The waitresses were hot and they happily wheeled me out to my car in a wheelchair! But it's more of an attraction than anything else.I really wanted to like this place, as I always do with local coffee shops that are trying to compete with the Starbucks monster. Plus, it's right next to the hair salon I frequent (Altered Ego - it's great). However, there were several factors that made me bring down a five-star review (for the coffee) to a three. 

First, I do want to emphasize that the drink I got was absolutely divine. I ordered a caffe latte with almond milk and sugar-free vanilla syrup, and it came out really well.

The problem, however, was that I was getting the drink to go and it took at least 10 minutes for them to make it. I'm seriously not sure what the barista was doing (two people were behind the counter chatting). I was kind of in a hurry and was expecting it not to take very long to steam some milk, press the coffee, and put some syrup in. I tried to banter a little with the barista and she was having none of it. (Apparently she was tired and caffeine wasn't doing it.) Please, if the CUSTOMER is making the effort to put YOU in a good mood, try to let it happen

The other thing was that while the cafe was totally full, everybody was totally silent. As H.C. said, the place was full of zombie hipsters. It was really creepy. As I walked by various tables, people stared at me like I was interrupting their very important business. 

In conclusion, if you want to work on your computer in total silence and thus don't mind a) the long wait or b) the fact that everyone else is also totally silent, you will fit right in. I definitely loved my drink, but I don't know if I will be able to withstand the death stares for long enough to order.Older theater. Needs updating. However, the tickets are $1 cheaper, so I think they take that into account. There are definitely better options but if you want to save a few bucks, it's not horrible. And it's not busy which is a plus.nice employees, but rather pretentious  in fact more employees than customers walking around with nothing to really do. And maybe Im getting old but music way too mutha-fruggin loud, dont go if you want to have a conversation. D.J.Plays all Black rap music and not one person of color is in the whole club except for a Mexican rest-room attendant. go figure. upside a beautiful venue, and the outside patio is to die for. Lots of women dancing together on the dance floor with each other, all the young men just staring hoping to score with all the lesbians. go figure again. very expensive watered down martinis if you are not there for happy hour.It was OK as Mexican food goes.  But the salsa tasted like it came from a jar.  Prices seemed a notch higher than most similar places like Frank & Fina's.

I might try it again though.I liked breadfruit and the concept of Caribbean food.  But the food is really healthy and is missing some Jamaican flavor. Also the food takes a really long time to come out. I got the jerk chicken. It was a large dry chicken breast but it did have flavor. My recommendation is try it if you want some food that is different. Just don't think you are eating true Caribbean food.Ruby Tuesdays is always an evolving change.   The salad bar which was one of their biggest attractions has cut back on the number of items available.   At the same time the side items on the menu have increased in depth and taste.   

The food was okay ... not the best and not the worst ... just average.   RT seems to want to become an above average place but they are missing it on the details.  

Wait staff was okay they did come around a number of times.  For as slow as it was, i would have expected more attentive staff.  Additionally, the staff could have been cleaning the place more as it was slow.Overall: 3

Kind of expensive for what you got, but the karts are fun.

Pros:
-exciting and fun
-good for groups
-electric karts so you dont smell like gas/exhaust
-print out of race results

Cons:
-expensive
-don't get additional laps if they have to slow down the race to fix the course or if someone spun out
-wait can be slow but at least you can watch other people race
-if you pay for multiple races, no guarantee they will be back to back (we had to wait 45+ minutes from our first race to our second)

Overall a fun activity but there are probably better ways to spend your money in Vegas.The Panda Express of Filipino fast food. I been coming here since high school. they have more selections than the comparable Filipino restaurants around. I love coming here for breakfast because everything is fresh! I just wish they renovate the place or maintain it. Food is good but I'm just skeptic about what goes on in the back and overall cleanliness of the place. I'm from the Philippines tho so I don't mind much but for American standards it's something to think about.Another Emeril restaurant, about what you would expect. Rolls were slightly scorched and fairly tasteless. For appetizers, I had tartare, which was excellent, served traditionally with quail egg, and normal garnish. My wife had blue point oysters, which would have been good, but whoever shucked them drained all their natural juice off, losing most of their flavor. 

For main course, I had duck which was good but ordinary, moist but not a lot of flavor. My wife had linguini with Manila clams and broccolini with chili flakes and white wine, which was very nice. 

Prices for what we received were a  bit steep, but given the area not unexpected.I have been to a few of Emeril's restaurants and I found this one unremarkable.  I kept hearing its "Cajun themed" and having been and lived in New Orleans, I never saw it.  I had filet and lobster.  I did order the gumbo, but outside of that, I have this place unremarkable.  I think there are better steak houses out there and better options with the Palazzo to eat, but for you - it might be worth a try.OK not as good as last time, I knew it must've been a fluke!  This time we ordered the tapas baked focaccia to tide us over while we waited for our food. It was damn good. We ate them up and waited.  As we waited, our waitress offered free bread to the table next to us. Now this was my biggest gripe last time I was here, so we ordered something, only to find out they give bread away. FML.

I got the same pasta [low fat zucchini and shrimp scampi] I had last time, it wasn't nearly as good. Apparently, must've been different chefs?  Shrimp came with the tails on it....drives me nuts and the tails/shell was soggie/soft, gross.

Friend got a pizza and she ate it right up.

Took a long time, again. Was almost 1.5 hours before we got out of there, so it's not good for a work lunch if all you get is an hour.  Last time they had some pretty cool music, this time not so much.Fun place in old town Scottsdale.  The drinks are pretty good.  Appetizers are delicious.  The group I was ordered sushi (which they enjoyed) and the waitress walked away without taking my non-sushi order.  After waving her down, I ordered the ramen - big mistake as it was horrible.
The bathroom with its total toilets are an experience within themselves...Overall, sushi, apps, and drinks are good.  Be cautious when ordering other food items...Kids under six eat free, thats def a positive. Its just a small quesadilla but hey, its better than nothing.

came here with high expectations, and i think i was a little let down

i had no clue what to order and i asked the guy (near the tortillas?) and he shrugged. Real big help buddy! Then i asked which of their salsa was the most popular and he said all. Okay, obviously i wasnt getting far so i just chose a burrito with barbacoa. 

In all honesty, it was WAY too sweet. All the barbacoa Ive had in the past had more of a spicy flavor. Even my friend with me said it was way too sweet and shes an avid Rio junkie.

 I think i would have given them two stars if it wasnt for the wide variety in lemonade and the whole kids get a free quesadilla. I didnt feel anything special customer service wise. I get I came during lunch rush on sunday, 12:30pm but help me when i ask what to eat!

I will add I did try my friends salad and it was delicious. Will try them again and next time get that.The place is a complete HIT or MISS... and the cover is... whatever they can get it seems.  Most of the time if I walk down the strip before 12am, i get offered free admission. (I'm usually fairly well dressed, but I am a guy).   However, anytime it is expecting somewhat of a crowd, I have seen them charge 10$ to one person, and 20$ to the guy right behind them.  If you dont take the 20$, try to bargain... they'll usually accept it. 

* i have never, and will never pay a cover here *

Even though i have never paid a cover, nor would I ever..., the place has been at times one of my favorite places to go in Las Vegas!  The people in there are either:
                A.) New arrival to Vegas, or 
                B.) Dont want to pay or wait in line for a mainstream club.
Both of those factors make it have potential for a very fun, cheap, and exciting night!  When i go to one of the mainstream clubs/bars, it seems like the women are more interested how deep your pockets are as far as money goes, in the Rockhouse @ IP... it reminds me more of a club back in my hometown Pittsburgh (everyone there for just a good time).

It has seemed in the past few months theyve changed their early evening strategy by throwing up a few overpriced beer pong tables.

Useful info: Monday is ladies night.


Pros:  -Cheapest drinks in an "on strip" club
            -Little to no wait in line, little to no cover charge
            -Hometown feel; but in VEGAS!
            
Cons: -Hit and miss. I have gone in there at 12 on a saturday and have been able to count the people in there on my two hands!
             -No restroom on site. IP is the closest thing, far walk!
             -Parking anywhere near it is tough. Especially because IP has the worst parking garage in the entire vegas area.any place that has beer pong inside is gonna get a thumbs up from me! only thing that really sucks is that you have to go into the hotel to pee out all that beer, and their bartenders dont necessarily have a heavy hand with drinksNothing special here.. Cheap beer for happy hour.. 16oz drafts for $2. The nachos were very good and a friend raved about the clam chowder.. He actually threatened to lick the bowl. 

The music is way too loud for a sports bar. 

There's pool tables, which is nice, but we didn't play. 

Overall it's a decent place to go when you can't think of anywhere else to go.This is a great place for a cheap breakfast.  The portions are great and the waffles are even better.  I also like the huge ham steak and eggs breakfast.  The service is hit or miss.  The keno runners are super nice.  If you are staying at the hotel I recommend this dinner type place..This is an average food spot with really good service. I'm not really big on all the wok stuff, so I had to find some alternatives...and, there really aren't many. We had a good time and our service was funny. I'd go back.Great drinks. A bit pricey tho =\I've been here quite a few times, but am undecided.  It's clean, spacious, and has a great location - a good meeting place.  Other than that...I got nothing.  My last time "in" I ordered a coffee drink.  Not knowing how it was made or what was in it, I asked.  Apparently I caught the girl behind the counter completely off guard, and had to break it down - beginning first with the type of coffee.  Questions answered, my thought was it shouldn't take long - I was the only one in line.  Wrong!  I don't know if the lady went outside to milk a cow while I dozed off to sleep, but at least 15 minutes went by before my drink was ready.  I also asked for water.  At Starbucks I am handed a cup filled ice and water.  Here, I was given a cup with directions to "find" the water.  If not for a friend who told me to look for a tab near the lemonade, I would have had to go without.  Who knew?  Apparently everyone else, as the rest of my group laughed!  Leaving near dinner time it would have been nice to pick something up to take home, but after seeing so many shuffling in line, I gave up the thought.  It could have turned into another "water" expedition, and my friends had left the building.For a burger joint in Vegas, its a little pricey. For a burger joint in LA, I'd say it fits right in. 

I've been here once before, but never noticed they had a veggie burger. How did I miss that before? The Abstract kinda sounds gross. When I hear that name in regards to burgers, I think of Spam or a hotdog or some kind of FORMED meat. But the Abstract is their homemade veggie burger with grains and crap. Whoever made the batch that I ate, didn't mix thoroughly. I was hitting chunks of salt left and right. 

Maybe no one else cares, but veggie burgers are a serious affair to me. This veggie burger was meh. But I really appreciate that they're trying to satisfy the vegetarian demographic AND, they're homemade and crap. The inner texture was mushy, but it was super ceded by the crispy fried outside. Like a burger french fry. They also have portobello burgers for the carniphobic. 

They have a lot of add-ons available. Which can be dangerous. You could probably make a $20 burger. 

On my burger, I also got cut greens, provolone, and garlic mayo ... which was not very garlicky. I got the Hawaiian kaiser (like Hawaiian sweet bread, NOT with the intestines). 

My friend got sweet potato fries. They were alright. But the best sweet potato fries I've ever had was at Outside Inn on Charleston and Hualapai. 

My friend ordered the third size up in burgers. The smallest was the mini, then the something, then the majestic, I think. Anyways, it really wasn't that big. Like the diameter was the same size as that of the bun, but it was thick. 

The frozen custard. Luv It is now the yard stick by which I measure all other frozen custards (which will be henceforth referred to as: frotards). Create's was not as heavy, BUT it was also not as smooth ... until it melted. Their ratio of egg to milk was probably more milk, I'm guessing. It was more like ice cream than frotard, I think. They have a good variety of topping, though. 

If you dine in, after you pay for your junk, they give you a number to put on your table and they run the food to you when its ready, like Jason's Deli. 

This place is dangerously close to In-n-Out, Chipotle, and the Golden Spoon. And i would hardly call these burgers gourmet. 

* off the strip, non-casinoChecked this place out on a Friday night around 730PM.  We had a BOGO Combo coupon from the Entertainment Book.  Thought it was going to be pretty busy, but it was only about 2/3 full when we got there and about 1/2 full when we left.  It's a little confussing as to how to get your order in and the large menu to read is in a weird place.  We actually didn't notice it until we were leaving.

Went with the make-it-yourself burgers.  His: 1/2LB patty with just about any/every topping he liked and regular fries.  He liked it, but did comment that it probably wasn't the best combo of toppings (his bad for not thinking it through).  It did get really messy though, and had to finish it up with a fork and knife.  Mine: 1/4LB patty with mostly veggies, wrapped in lettuce (more like sandwiched with 2 large lettuce leaves) with sweet potato fries (tasty-  tossed with cinnamon and brownsugar).  Total, with the coupon, came to about $12- 2 burgers, 2 fries, 2 drinks.  They do charge extra for sweet potato fries ($.60 I think), and for premium toppings (like avocado, bacon, sauteed mushrooms, etc).

Overall, the burgers were tasty and filling.  As mentioned, the toppings kind of overpower the meat, but that was fine with us.  You can go as basic or as intricate as you want.  There are a ton of toppings to choose from which makes for a very neat concept, but I think I'd try SmashBurger down the street, before giving this place another shot.I came into the store looking for new headphones that would go over my ears so they wouldn't fall out while I run. I made the mistake of stopping near the nano ipods when an employee came by and tried to bumrush me into buying something. No, thank you. I just walked further into the store and ignored her.

There were plenty of headphones that matched what I needed, but most of them were so expensive. The one I bought happened to be wireless only, but the mini ipod wasn't, so I decided to purchase a nano ipod because it does have wireless capabilities. The employees when I bought my headphones and when I bought the ipod were far better than that first person who greeted me and didn't try to overwhelm me with pressure.

This is just an average Apple Store though, nothing great about it. It is nice that I can charge my phone through their laptops, but it's not a place I go into for fun.Phoenix Pride is such an eclectic experience.  Was this the prettiest Pride around?  No!  Can Phoenix Pride be super fun though? Yes!  I have had two different experiences here.  In 2010, I consumed some 6 or so drinks.  This combined with the dehydrating heat made me a little sloppy, so I don't remember any of the less than pleasant aspects of this Pride Festival.  In 2011, I was sober the whole time and thus, here are my recollections.  Tips: Buy a ticket beforehand.  There will be a long line to buy one there and you will pay 5 bucks more.  Make sure you have cash.  Once you wait to get in (you still wait if you have pre-purchased a ticket), you will need to wait in another line to get an ID badge that says you are 21.  Then you can wait again to buy drink tickets (5 bucks each...a pretty solid deal) and THEN you can wait in another line to actually get your drink.  This place has more lines than Disney World.  Some of the booths were interesting.  Yelp even had a booth manned by the most stereotypical lesbian I have seen in a while.  Was she hired out for the event? (I remember Progressive did this last year).  Back to the event.  The dance pavilion was once again filled with the twinkeist of twinks groove shaking while the real hotties trotted around in packs showing off their marble cut physiques while big sunglasses hid their butta faces.  The various flocks of lesbians clustered around the food booths.  Phoenix Pride is full of extensive people watching potential, but the eye candy was few and far between.  I guess that's why it is so crucial to be smashed.The burgers are good but not amazing, the chili dogs aren't bad either but for me the only reason I keep coming back to this place is to keep trying more of the milk shake flavors that they have.  So far blueberry is my favorite, but I've only tried about six so far.Well let's start by saying that their cilantro pesto deserves a star all by itself. That stuff turns anything you put it on into amazing!

Although, I unfortunately had to subtract 2 stars because I felt so rushed by the workers!! I barely had time to think what I really wanted on my burrito. There wasn't anyone behind me in line and only two people in the place. You would think they could be a little more patient with me, especially since it was my first time there and I wanted to customize my meals perfectly. I even asked a couple times about the workers opinions of what she liked best and she laughed and said she didn't know...

It would be nice to have some more feedback from the employees here as well as not feel rushed and like I'm taking up to much of their time for my one order.

On the upside, it's close to the LVAC gym and you can definitely make healthy options here. I like their wide variety of sides and sauces. They even have sweet potatoes! I will be back and hope to see improvements in the future. :)We did a $65 tasting and it was a 15 course meal!  Only thing I didn't like was the grilled ground chicken. 

Only reason I knocked 2 stars off was because we made a reservation and they made it clear that it would cost us if we were late or didn't show, but we were there early and we got seated 15 minutes past our reservation. At least the food made up for it.Went here last weekend because we had some free tickets. Watched the 10:40am session of "Rio". Kinda fun movie, the toddler behaved the whole time. Fairly clean joint. Comfortable chairs with fold-down armrests/drinkrests. Subtle lighting during the movie. I was particularly impressed with the fact that they sell White Castle hamburgers at the front counter. There is also an additional goodies counter inside the movie corridor area (ie past the ticket monkey). Video games and bubble gum machines in the foyer. The popcorn was fresh and we all wolfed it down. Exit corridor is separate from the main entry foyer, so that exiting patrons can get out without having to push through whatever throngs might be congregating in the ticket purchasing section.

I've got no complaints, we'll probably come back next time we have free tickets (I've got wayyy too much free entertainment at home to drop $$ at the movies). This place ain't Vegas but there's absolutely nothing wrong with it that I could see. Can't say I have any idea about this "d-box" stuff the other reviewers are talking about, maybe I'll look into trying that next time?I ordered the Steak Fajita Burrito. Tasty and cheap but Qdoba seems just a tad bit more fresh.We stopped in for lunch today. We arrived just after they opened and I think we were the first ones there. The place is nicely decorated and the service was good. We ordered Edamame to start. It took quite a while for it to come out and when it did it did not seem to be cooked all the way. I also went with the salt and pepper option but I think I would leave the pepper off if I ordered it again. We ordered and split a couple rolls. The crunchy & Las Vegas roll. I didn't care for the Las Vegas roll but I am not a huge Salmon fan, but my son liked them both. The food was ok but the place I normally go is just as good and cheaper and that's probably where I will go in the future.Pros: clean restaurant / restroom, fast service, decent side dishes, lots of selections, Kim chi fried rice, open seating, and they do most of the cooking for you.

Cons: they don't explain the menu or offer AYCE, pricey, no fountain drinks, they put raw pork belly next to already cooked beef brisket, slippery stainless chop sticks. It was very hot, no AC and the fans were only directed to big groups.

Overall, I'll visit again and give them one more chance... Maybe.Great local place for a show.Was looking for a quick brisket sandwich and headed to Dickey's. The brisket was average, but the the staff was weird. No one was at the drive thru and I went in. There were several Spanish speaking employees kind of wandering around and finally(after about 5 minutes of standing around) a white guy finally took my order. The brisket was passable, but the experience was not good.The $11 a-curry-a-day lunch combos was paltry and plain bland. Dal was flavorless and the rice was tough. So I effectively paid $11 for a few mouthfuls of chicken curry (which was decent) and two pieces of naan. I'd rather go to a place like little india where they charge half as much without the fancy decor.
The paneer entree dishes though are just fabulous. If two people are going I'd say forget about variety and just order paneer.I was SHIT FACED when i ate this burger, so my opinion is somewhat biased. Sweet potato fries are a really fantastic thing, yes sir. i really enjoyed my burger, but i can't say that its as good as a fathers office burger

I think this place is probably a little inconsistent, my burger was ordered medium rare but i swear it was still mooing when they brought it to me. I didn't care though, i was trashed and hungry. 

i would have eaten at the pink taco restaurant at the hard rock had it been open after the muse concert, but it wasn't so i cabbed it back to the mirage and grubbed here.Closed forever. Property repossessed by the landlord.The Applebee's on Elliot is a Big NO for me. Service is very slow & they didn't even give me the correct amount of food I paid for! I will say that I do go to the Applebee's on 24th & Baseline quite frequently. It's good for a quick drink, food is average, service is ok! Like going during non-busy hrs to avoid the crowd. Drink of choice is the Blue Moon or Long Island Iced TeaMarket Bistro offers homemade soups, salads, and really fresh sandwiches. I liked the modern decor, staff, and clientele. Very casual - a great lunch spot... (the sandwiches are really big - try splitting one).Food is "meh" however love the bar, reasonably priced drinks AND they show the UFC fights. Fun environment and the bartenders are friendly.Yesterday Mr. C and I rode our bikes over to the Ikea.  We misread the website and didn't realize we were there an hour before the store opens. Luckily, we saw a sign that the cafeteria opens at 9am on Saturday, so we decided to check it out.

Mr. C ordered the "Big" breakfast which was a typical plate that included  eggs, french toast, potatoes, and bacon.  I ordered the Swedish  pancakes and lingonberry sauce.  Our bill was less than $10, and with free coffee before 10am, I think it's worth it.  

We'll be attending breakfast again.  Yum.Everyone I talk with who has had this pizza loves it. I think it is fine, but love it, nope.

No matter how I cook these things it turns out much more soggy than I would like. The ingrediants are fine but they sure do give off a lot of moisture when baking it.

So it is not horrible, just not really to my liking.Chipotle the organization has developed a pretty good business model: Good food, made fresh in front of the customer, Fast-ish service that is usually well managed and friendly, and a website experience that allows you to order ahead of time and cut the line.  Additionally the fair is (seemingly) healthier than standard fast food and the decor is contemporary which is a refreshing change fron the obnoxious appearance of the average jack in the box or Subway.

However, I am giving this chipotle 3 stars, even though I eat here more often than I eat at any other restaurant.  The two reasons for the average rating are:

1. A homeless person has set up shop outside of the front door
2. As I have alluded, I use the online ordering feature, and they seem to meet the promised time only occasionally.
 
So- they need to shoo the bum and pay more attention to their online customers.  Then I will give this chipotle 5 starsLooks like a cool place (a lot bigger than it looks on the outside) with a pretty big menu.  Food was pretty average and coffee was as well.

Service was really friendly though.Oh, LAVO -- you gangsturr you.  From my past two experiences here, I have noticed that LAVO definitely has an affinity for hip-hop and dirty rap (Bay Area style!).  Although, this could also be because Three 6 Mafia came and performed last Sunday!

But don't get me wrong -- LAVO is every bit swanky, exquisite, and artistic.  It's no big-name club (like TAO or XS), but for such a humble size, LAVO is surprisingly fun all thanks to the rowdy, upbeat music and club goers.

Some downsides?
[ - ] Dance floor is way too crowded
[ - ] Raucous crowd = more drunk, perverted, grabby dudes

Solution?  I recommend getting a table / bottle service.  Both times my friends and I came here, we got bottle service for "free."  This basically means that we didn't pay for the table, but instead gave a generous gratuity to our VIP host.  How? Find friends of friends who know people in Vegas or wait for LAVO promoters to approach you during the day.

Granted I've never eaten in their downstairs dining area, I'm sure their food is also noteworthy.  While we were upstairs, Christopher Mintz-Plasse (aka McLovin) dined with friends for his 21st birthday.Note that this is a review for the restaurant and not the club experience. (Hey Yelp, maybe there should be a way to separate the two for venues that function as both!) 

Had dinner at Lavo with a large group of friends. 

The interior of the restaurant is beautiful. I don't say this about a lot of restaurants, but ladies, check out the bathroom!!! 

The meal was accompanied by garlic bread with marinara sauce. Quite yummy, but there was a bit of controversy when we were given refills and then charged for them. After a friend talked to the servers and argued that we hadn't been told there was a charge for refills, the charge was waived. 

A friend and I shared the Kobe beef carpaccio with black truffle vinaigrette. I like truffle flavoring, but I think the vinaigrette overpowered the beef. Past a certain point with truffle-based sauces, less becomes more.

My entree was risotto with braised short rib. The rice was delicious and the short rib had good flavor, but the meat wasn't soft enough. When I think of braised short rib, I think of tender meat falling off the bone.

We shared several vegetable sides with the table. Pretty standard stuff. The creamed spinach was a bit too heavy though, even for creamed spinach. Probably our mistake for ordering it in addition to all the food we had.

My bf ordered a seared tuna entree, which definitely got an A+ for presentation. I tried a bit, and it was tasty. However, he came down with symptoms of food poisoning several hours later. Let's be honest though - since we were in Vegas, it's hard to tell how much of that was caused or exacerbated by alcohol. 

Others at the table enjoyed their pizzas, which looked very large for one person, and pastas. 

I was extremely full after the meal. The menu is available on the website for you to evaluate the prices yourself, but I thought $60 for half an appetizer, an entree, and the split cost of a few sides without any drinks or alcohol was a bit high. Then again, this is the Strip! 

To sum it up, Lavo is one of the better places I've tried on the Strip, after a series of disappointing food experiences. (Refer to other reviews if interested.)
* decent food but with something left to be desired 
* great presentation
* wonderful interior
* sufficient seating for large groups
* slightly high pricesThis location is limited so not all items listed on their website is available. No smoked salmon! :( they're also limited to only 3 cream cheese flavors (plain, strawberry, and I forgot the 3rd option. I got a toasted asiago bagel and it came out greasy :( the staff was nice and friendly tho.I had high hopes, but sadly they weren't met. I am a big believer in judging a place, at least initially, on their burgers. I had a basic bacon cheeseburger with fries. The fries were great. Skin on slices of potato, clearly house made. The burger sounded promising: black earth beef. I ordered medium rare and it came out properly pink, but it was dry. I wonder if the beef was "too good" for a burger; not enough fat to make a burger juicy like it should be. The bun was fairly dry as well which didn't help. Last point: no credit cards. Normally I'm down with a no CC place, but this is a sit down dinner location and with the prices (which were perfectly fine for the vibe), you'd be looking at $50 for a date night... that is beyond cash only territory in my opinion. Glad I tried it, but not eager to return.The service and the ambiance I would rate at 4 stars. You step into this place and you can almost forget that you are in the midst of the artificial decadence called Vegas. It has a very authentic feel to it and the owners seem to be Italians. 

Tried the seafood spaghetti and asked for a white wine sauce instead of tomato sauce. The seafood and spaghetti itself was good, but the sauce was watery and added no flavor to the pasta.The thing I like best about The Gym is the name. If you need an excuse to go have a drink or what ever and your S.O. asks where you are going, now you can say, "The Gym." That being said, they do have a full bar and a cool drink menu, which I frequent by trying new drinks when ever I eat there. The food is decent bar food, wings and all the trimmings. I have heard its the best place in QC to get your groove on, but I have yet to catch that. If you live out in BFEQC, you should check it out for sure!If you've never been, it's in side New York, New York casino -- It was fun -- we went on two separate nights.  The girls in my group got free wrist bands & I paid $10 with a discount card I got earlier in the evening after going to the sausage-fest at Coyote Ugly (same casino, but upstairs) We paid for a table & bottle service, then ended up ordering a shitload more drinks as well, so the final tab was significant.  I'd have to agree with some of the other people here that the drink prices seemed high, even for Vegas.  A little too much fog & smoke & the layout makes it hard to move around the place when it's full.  The bouncer staff was outstanding, though -- they get 5 stars in my book (unsure if it was because we had more girls than guys in our group, but whatever).  Our waitress rocked, too (pardon the pun), she checked on us constantly, stopped to talk to us like real customers, so we never really wanted for anything.  The only negative issue really was that the DJ wouldn't take any requests from the ladies; not a huge deal, we all had fun anyway.Went there a couple days for first time. The place is more like a sports bar with hooters-like waitresses. Just got a couple of Guinness and a dessert while watching NBA playoffs. Service was OK, though took sometime before seeing the waitress to put my order. Food was OK, but I'll go back to try 1-2 entrees. Overall, just another sports bar, little to do with Irish (BTW: kilts are from Scotland)We like to stay at Sheraton's  "club level" when traveling for our own comfort, and this particular hotel has a long way to go to meet the standard we have experienced at other Sheraton hotels.  Our stay from in late June 2009 for 5 nights was not disappointing relative to all the other com€forts noted by fellow Yelpers.  However, they need to either bring the club up to the standard of other great Sheratons which is well within the manager's capacity.  So,  my downgrade is relative to the club level, not the hotel in general.  Just words to the wise if you like this sort of feature.  Cheers!I was in Madison last week to visit my niece, and we went here for dinner. I had a chicken mole, which was pretty good, especially the mole sauce, however was a bit disappointed by the service. Maybe it was because it was on the later side and our waiter was ready to leave for the night, but both my niece and I felt a bit rushed. If we were going to come back another time, I'd definitely come a little earlier. But as far as the food goes, it was pretty good.I found the crepes to hit the spot on a lazy hungover Sunday morning...

I had the bacon, egg and cheese crepe with cheddar cheese.
I would have to say it was a bit average, and would have enjoyed maybe some sort of creamy sauce on the inside! 

I did find that the service was a bit slow...

I was disappointed to see that their menu only has nutella as a chocolate topping for the dessert crepes.  I HATE nutella and wish they had just regular chocolate as an option as well :(One of the few Asian shopping centers in the Phoenix metro area.  There's an Asian market, various restaurants (Thai, Vietnamese, Boba, Chinese), and a few retail shops.  It doesn't have the selection or energy of the Chinatown markets in Vegas, LA, or Orange County.  Kind of shocking actually when you consider that there are 3x more people in Phoenix than Vegas.

Return Factor - 90%  Where else am I going to go for my Asian fix?Finding this quaint location wasn't to hard... i like that there is a parking lot right north of the place... as well as street parking :) 

you walk in the place and wow... its a completely different atmosphere... low lighting but in a calming way rather than creepy... 

they have a DJ.. the music makes the setting but to be honest it was a little odd for my taste,,, 

Our waitress was very nice and helpful... automatically served us cucumber water... (which tastes amazing!!) and then asked for our drink orders ... a good waitress can seriously turn everything upside down or completely make your visit ya know... its a pet peeve of mine.. customer service... 

every table had a pink candle lit... pink lights hung above the chefs area... it was just so relaxing! the mirrors on the wall around this cool looking splatter painting... i was diggin it... 

everything on their menu is served as appetizers... which kinda sucks.. they are all at least 6-12 bucks at least ... from what i saw.. and the waitress said that they recommend for people to get at least 2-3 a piece.... wow, on top of drinks.. its kinda pricey to me.. good thing we shared everything... 

the lemongrass chicken (cant remember the full title) was amazing!! so good... the gyozo (dumplings) were alright.. a little too minty for my taste... we had this other thing where they bring you the hot stone and you cook your own meat... it was alright but the stone only stayed hot enough to cook the meat med rare... i don't like my meat to moo at me... so its was alright... but i prefer it well done... 

the beef wrapped in grape leaves.. well i was soo excited to try them.. but was sadly disappointed... they were so fiery hot (spicy) that i almost had tears in my eyes... never did it say on the menu .. SPICY... after a server came over and saw us gasping for water.. he filled us up and said, oh yea those are pretty spicy... wow good thing i had my TUMS lol 

over all 
The atmosphere was amazing..... 
the staff was fabulous... 
the food... eh... 
the menu is crap... if your gonna serve spicy food you should say its spicy! isn't that some sort of health hazard?! 
and its kinda on the pricey side... 

i think i would go back again... But i don't think i would opt to... 
there are alot more dishes i would like to try... maybe a different location would be better?I struggled with how many stars I wanted to rate the Bliss Spa @ the W Hotel in Scottsdale.   Ultimately I decided to give the 3 -stars based on experience only.   The service was great and for the record, I am a HUGE fan of Bliss products overall.

The reason I rated my experience 3 stars is because the Spa didn't match my expectations.   There was no place to really hang out and relax either before or after the service.  The furniture was for looks only - not comfort.   If you wanted to go with a bunch of girlfriends, as I so often do, I don't think think the "lounge" is really conducive to kibitzing with the girls.

My services were fabulous.  And I have no complaints.   I used a Living Social Deal which gave me $200 worth of services for $100.  Nice! Right?

In short, I think the Bliss Spa is more like a Day Spa experience that you might find at Dolce Spa.  I prefer a Resort Spa experience which gives me a relaxing lounge, access to the pool, and the prices are comparable.

But, if you have never used Bliss products, you really should visit .  I love their Lemon Sage Body Butter and their facial foaming cleanser.Ingredients are fresh.
Service is pristine.

The tofu and bean dish with brown rice was aright.

I liked the pineapple drink I had.

Wasn't a big fan of the zucchini baked pasta though.
Its long thin sliced zucchini instead of pasta, and the texture just isn't right.

On the pricy side but most of it seems healthy.
I guess I can't have both health and taste.Seemed a withering pub for diehard locals.Two mains for a tenner sounded pretty good - particularly when one of the menu options was an 8 ounce burger with a side of fries.  For the non-bovine inclined there was a reasonable selection of alternatives.  Sadly my partner was non-plussed about her focaccia and roasted vegetables - it looked a pretty half-hearted effort to me.

The burger was good, with just enough charred edges to let you forget about an  unused udder dangling in a field somewhere. 

A good selection of beers on draft, but be warned - they don't come cheap.  A couple of pints of Blue Moon set me back over a tenner.  I'm maybe out of touch with pint prices, but i haven't had a bill shock like that since I filled up the car on super unleaded.

Decor typical of the chain, but pleasant enough and attentive and polite staff.  Not quite 4 star stuff for me, but a safe bet for a spot of lunch.Got these guys to make me a club sandwich even though it isn't on the menu (I like pushing my luck) and they were more than happy to accommodate me. There wasn't any room for me to sit down inside and the seats were wet from the rain shower earlier in the day, so I decided to eat it on the bus (homeless style!)

I could have sworn they left the bread out in the rainstorm, it was wetter than a sponge, I could only eat a few bites then I had to throw it away. It was a shame because the filling was beautiful.

Broke my wee heart.Across from John Knoxx's House is the Museum of Childhood. Despite its slightly creepy name , my friend and I decided to take a look around, mostly because of its free entrance. It's pretty cool, you get to see a lot of toys from olden days to modern ones (you might even see your own childhood games which makes one feel particularly old!) and other than the particularly scary porcelain dolls room, it's all a bit of fun. On weekends it tends to be particularly crowded of families, so if you want a scream-free wonder around I would suggest going on a week day.The gift shop is pretty cool too, with lots of stocking fillers for Christmas!Student focused pub...
Beer garden for the summer...
Lots of drink specials.Corniche kind of goes over my head, since I could never afford high fashion. I do appreciate the aesthetic of the designs however, since the majority of clothing that ends up on the catwalk is certainly art over form fitting ergonomic functionality.

I agree with what El says - something doesn't sit right about Corniche. It's very high end, and although there are bargains it seems a tad out of place in this moderately vogue area (which, let's face it, is teetering off the tourist trap of the Royal Mile). But although some may see it as ill fitting with the surrounding shops, it is indeed attention grabbing and complements the expensive style of Moleta Munro.

I know that both shops are selling different items altogether, but I would argue that Moleta Munro has got the decor nailed. Corniche looks firmly rooted in the style of clothes stores 10+ years ago, For selling ultra high end expensive garments, it's a bit of a jumble and not what you'd expect from a place sporting the label of Westwood.

But I'll focus on the good - they slash a fair amount of some of the prices, and with more stock there is of course more choice! High end fashion is out of my price range and a bit too outlandish for me (like El, I thin k it largely belongs on the catwalk and in photo shoots) but if you are a budding model with some spare cash money then it's definitely worth a look.Cult really really annoys me. I think their clothes are pretty cool but the prices are unbelievable. You can get pretty much the same thing in Topman or H&M for about half the price. I know it is all branded, but even so.

Well anyway, if you're looking for any Superdry, Carhartt, Bench etc clothing then this is definitely the place for you. It has a huge selection of both men's and women's clothing. If you like check shirts then look no further, they have an ungodly amount here, as well as check jackets, hoodies and pretty much everything else is available in check. The advantage of it having these brand names is that the quality is excellent; I have had a few tshirts and shirts from here that are still in great condition, they don't warp or stretch at all. 

Back to the problem though, the prices are appalling. For what is effectively high street fashion, it is almost double the prices of most other places. Sometimes it's upwards of £40 for a tshirt. No thanks. If you really can afford this much then Cult is a great shop, if you are just a normal person though, most of the stuff is unjustifiably expensive.Came here with a bachelorette party of 9.  The atmosphere leaves much to be desired, but it did fit with the utilitarian feel of the Luxor.  We were hoping for a lively vibe, but it was pretty quiet and dull.  The food was decent.  I had the chicken enchiladas.  They were good.  The chips and salsa were pretty good.  I won't be rushing back here.I LOVE their desserts.

They have the caramel shortbread.  I'm american, and to me.. it tasted like Reeses Pieces, less crumbly, more caramely, slightly less sweet.
And the guy recommended their Tiffin, which he described as "Christmas pudding- almost."  And I tried Xmas pudding awhile back.. it's good, like fruitcake soaked in rum.

I came back and bought a kilo of this stuff to take home.  It's that yummy.Ok Hanny's.  Do you have ANY idea how excited I was when I heard about you?  You sound like just what we need downtown:  a full liquor license and a full kitchen serving food until 1 am.  

So it is with great regret that I have to report I was fairly disappointed in my experience.  The space itself is really amazing, and they did something really cool with the way they kept the original aesthetic and fit a restaurant right in.  But it's in this weird space between "club" and "restaurant", and I think they just need to decide which one they'd rather be.

We had really, really bad service, too.  Nobody seemed to know what they were supposed to be doing, and we sat at our table for at least 5 minutes before anyone took our drink order, and that was with 2 waitresses just hanging out about 10 feet away.  But we both really enjoyed our pizza, and I thought the prices were very reasonable. 

I know Hanny's is still very new, and I love that we have a place to go get a bite at midnight (ok, so it's been years since I was still awake at midnight, but it's nice to know it's there).  So I'll definitely keep going back, and hope that it gels into something great.I walked in with a 4-star expectation and walked out with an exhausted jaw.  :-\

"Can I get some fabric softener up in here, please?!"  
Why?
"Cuz this son of a b*tch is hard as hell to eat!"

Never again shall I torture myself through that.  *_*

On paper, the roast beef sandwich sounded like a home run.  Who doesn't like roast beef that is griiiilllled? complemented with fried egg and bacon.

It didn't help that the ciabatta was just as tough to chew.  Boy, was it a loooong lunch.  One bite after another, thinking about all the starving children of the world.  I'm doing it for you guys, you hear me?! You guys!!!

Alas, I finished every single bite.  A few things that could improve this sandwich: use butter, perhaps make the meat a little rare, and use softer bread!

The only thing that saved this whole lunch was their homemade doughnuts.  It was soft and airy complemented with their fresh strawberry sauce and chocolate.

Another fail was trying to find their restroom, which I never found! I was told to head up the stairs and through mirrored hallway?! As contemporary as this place was, this creepy area I went to just did not fit the picture.  I eventually came across this narrow hallway with mirrors all around and then all of sudden it got bright with a bunch of doors.  

I seriously felt like I was at a carnival and I was suppose to choose, Door #1, Door #2, or Door #3.  Where the freak did I end up? Did I just enter the Twighlight Zone? Doo-dee-Doo-Doo...Doo-dee-Doo-Doo

#creepyMe and a friend went in craving indian food. It was empty, we were the only customers for the hour. I can imagine it would look beautiful at night, it looked glitzy and had pictures of Bollywood celebrities. The menu even educates and introduces you to Bollywood culture. That I admire, there was even a Bollywood film playing. The menu was friendlier than the service, in my opinion. The movie didn't even have english subtitles. It felt like there was a disconnection culture-wise.

When it comes to ordering, I wasn't sure what to order, I was more like 'something fruity' for drink, and 'something with lamb' for entree. The waiter immediately had great suggestions, but only by names, he doesn't eloborate much. I had mango juice and lamb palak (spinach cream). mango juice was sweet than fruity, and the lamb dish was spicy but very good. My friend had mango lassi and chicken masala. He's a big eater and these filled him up! our bill was near 50$ however. I'm not sure if that's an ideal price, perhaps I'll look around more.The food here was pretty good. But the service was very slow. And we had a cranky kid with us which you would think would speed them up a little bit. But that didn't help. They don't have high chairs or boasters so I would say this place is NOT kid friendly. If you want to try it leave the little ones at home for this one.What a cute little farmers market! I ventured out this morning in search of a market I could call my own, after leaving Kansas City's very awesome and huge River Market Farmer's Market. I can safely say if I end up moving closer to Old Town, this weekly event will make me happy!

It's on the small-ish side, but it sure packs a punch in the produce section. I was really impressed by the selection, the organization and especially the check out lines. Everything was in it's place and looked beautiful.

The tents of other goods and foods (and good foods, see what I did there) were awesome as well. Samples galore! Tamales (Vegan! Gluten free!), hummus and pita, nuts, delicious looking bread and fresh flowers were just some of the things to be found. There was also a company set up selling iced tea and coffee (iced... or hot, if you're a maniac) on the corner of the market. 

3 stars stands for A-OK on Yelp, and that's exactly what I thought about OTFM. Like I said, if I end up moving closer to the area it could be bumped up a star...for now, it's just a wee bit on the small side for me to drive almost half an hour every week. Also, parking is free on the streets and the public parking garage, but I'd advise to get here early. Market opens at 8:30 and I got there at 8:45ish with no problem parking in the compact cars section. (Next to a Navigator..uhh?) But when I left around 10:45 most spaces were taken. Get there early and enjoy local tastiness!This is definitely the LATE NIGHT hot spot. Since it is only one of the few places open 24 hours in phoenix, I hit this place up quite frequently. 

I have only known San Diego to be home of the infamous Carne Asada FRIES, and I was very excited to see that 'Bertos had them as well. I prefer the ones at the McDowell location to the ones at E. Thomas. They use the thinner fries. 

If you have yet to experience CARNE ASADA FRIES....you need to hop on board...QUICK!! Just imagine nachos, piled high with cheese, sour creme, guacamole and carne asada. Now...replace the tortilla chips with fries and there you have it. 

I know it may sound intense and overbearing to some, but I probably get them at least once every week or two. The rolled tacos are decent as well. Get them with cheese and guac. 

The only thing I wish for is better hot sauce/salsa. It's very blah and standard, but I still use it. Red one is the best in my opinion.Prices are status quo for any strip mall Chinese joint, the difference is that it's clean and you can actually sit down and enjoy your meal at a table versus plastic lawn furniture.  

Not that I'm too good for that, but I'm just sayin' there are *those* places....which deliver.

I've dined in here and ordered take out.  (Curry chicken first go around and garlic chicken as take out.)  I found both to be good, but not nearly as flavorful as I would have liked.  Next time I'll probably order them spicy and then revise my review.

Side note about take out:  I ordered it to be ready for pick up after a massage, which ran over.  The server looked at the time on my receipt, then looked at his watch, then scowled, which I found amusing.  

I have no complaints nor do I have raves so perhaps I'll say this about my neighborhood Chinese joint:  it's the missionary position of all mom and pop asian restaurants, which is appropriate considering it's in Gilbert. 

So...check it out...it'll get the job done. ;-)Aloha! a go go?  Obviously the sister joint to china a go go ....do Chinese know how to cook Hawaiin?  Anyways....I usually have lunch here once a week or so, I usually have the spam or bbq chicken saimin noodles.  They taste just like the description: spam n noodles.  I have also sampled the lunch special consisting of wayyyyy toooooo much fooood...... like 2 full slabs of chicken katsu, rice, macaroni salad and they toss in one maldagascar or whatever they call it puffy dessert thang....not many choices in the area so I gotta endure it....oh, and the tonkatsu sauce was too watery....til next time, good eating!Headline: Avoid breakfast.

While I was attending a conference at the Sands Conference Center, I came here twice - once for a quick lunch and once for breakfast.  

Let's start by saying that the food is the same as every other Grand Lux I've been to - it's good, but not spectacular, and they have options for everyone.  What makes things stand out (or not) is the service.

Lunch - we had good service - our waiter was very attentive.  I opted for a soup and salad plate -the salad, as normal, is reasonable.  The soup was a nice creamy chicken soup - overall pleasing.

Breakfast the next day - seriously? A queue?  ANd thats just to get sat - expect a 20 minute wait once you get sat.  Service sucked the big one.  However, they do have a buffet, so at least you can skip the waiting for your food as well.  We went in for a quick breakfast and ended up being late to the show.

Prices - good, even in comparison to non-Las Vegas places.  If you are looking for cheap eats in the hotel, this is the place for you.

Sorry - I can only give this an average grade - it's good but not spectacular, and breakfast service drags it down.If you want the meat to keep coming all night, then this is the place for you ;)  I couldn't handle it all, I ended up taking a bite of everything so I could try it all, but ended up wasting a lot of meat.  The cheese rolls are to die for.I had the seafood gumbo and tilapia po boy sandwich lunch meal. It was good. Just not enough gumbo. Had a side of red beans and rice for $2.99 it should be $1.99  prices are a bit expensive but food was good.3 1/2 stars

 It is a nice feeling knowing that you are eating healthy.  However, most of the food tasted okay not great.  Their homemade granola with fresh fruit and yogurt was very refreshing.

Burger - soso - plain, nothing special
Sonoran Scramble - sosoI would give this a 3.5. I would expect the pizza to be a lot better just because it is a Pie place. It was good but I've had a lot better. The thing this has is great ambiance. I love how low the lighting is. Dark tables that are turned perfectly so you don't feel like you are apart of other people's dinners. Great fire from the oven and open area bar. Had a good solid wine. We got the cheese board which was good. We both got pizza but like I said it was good just nothing special.I came in here one night by myself and sat at the sushi bar because they were so busy there was quite a wait for a table.  I was so excited to try the ramen but felt that since I was sitting at the sushi bar I needed to order some sushi (that's my excuse for pigging out).  I ordered some nigiri and the tonkatsu ramen.  

The nigiri is so delicious and fresh.  Unfortunately, I ended up sitting there for about 40 minutes before my ramen came out.  And when it did, it was not at all worth the wait.  The noodles were slightly undercooked, and the broth lacked the depth of some of my favorite ramen joints.  They had an egg, but it seemed like it was just a normal hard boiled chicken egg.  It added nothing but awkwardness to the dish.  There were a couple pieces of chasyu that were not tender at all and looked carelessly cut.  I was sorely disappointed.

So far, with my two visits, I've determined that I should only stick to ordering nigiri or sashimi.  I'll have to try the gyoza others have mentioned next time I go.

Another thing to note is that on this visit, when I first sat, at least three different people asked for my order and made sure I had ordered stuff.  As time went on, they seemed to forget about me.  Finally, the original server who took my order asked if I ever got my ramen.  This was 40 minutes later.  I counted.  I told her no, it was fine but asked for another beer.  Finally my ramen came but that last beer was nowhere to be found.  At this point I had finally began to get annoyed, especially since the ramen I had so looked forward to was less than mediocre.  I decided to forego the beer, paid my check and left.  What started out as such a great visit turned into a disappointment.Great aesthetic design is what first stands out about this casual cafe in the Encore. Mixes of greens, pinks, and black and white work very nicely. It would work out better, however, if a full frontal of the casino weren't provided too. The two scenes clash a bit.

I ordered the "Lunch Box," and chose to start with the Caprese Salad. Tomatoes were fresh and tasty, burrata was decent, but the crostini at the bottom (which is not a regular caprese ingredient) was too crisp and hard to cut.  Portion was also a bit small.  The main course was a Charred Ahi Tuna Slider. It was far too fishy for my taste. It's what really took this place out of 4 star range for me. The dessert was Warm Donut Bites. So yummy!  The presentation of the food is nice too.

Hubby had the Steak Frites and just loved the flavorful steak. It was a decent sized portion as well, especially considering it was lunch.

Polite, efficient service. Reasonable prices. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing.I am a huge fan of being the guinea pigs for future chefs. I loved my experience at the other two culinary classes. AI, impressed me with their extensive menu of six items for appetizers and entrees. Desserts were limited to four, but that is still going above and beyond for a learning environment. 

Opus Too is only available through reservations, but it is made simple through Yelp/Open Table. I set up a lunch for my friend and I for 12:15. We got there early, checked in, and were sat immediately. 

The students upfront all looked nervous and awkward in having to go live. Overall, I was not sure if they were more nervous about having to tend to real guest or doing this for a grade. Shaky on certain service fundamentals, the staff were still friendly. 

I really wished we had the table in front of the large window. With a great view into the kitchen, I would have not been so focused on how ill timed the courses were. Bread and water was served immediately. Appetizers took some time to come out. I got the Roasted Butternut Squash and Apple Salad. The dressing is drizzled along the outside of the plate while the greens were plain. It was light and I appreciated the dressing on the side. My friend enjoyed her salmon dish as well. When we were finished, the wait for the entrees was even longer. A few of the staff came to apologize for the delay and went to check on it. I had ordered the Braised Beef. The sauce was wonderful, but the meat was dry. Almost to a jerky consistency. The Veal was good. We had finished with the Chocolate cake with Fig Sorbet and Banana Rhum Bread Pudding. Both were solid dishes and our favorites. 

I had attended a few events thrown by the UNLV Hospitality Department and they offered comment cards. For a student, feedback would be beneficial. I wished there was a way to offer this without having to put the students on the spot. Allow them a chance to reflect on the day and make adjustments for the next would help them improve. 

For $10.95, it is an unbeatable deal. I want to go back and try a few other dishes.Enjoyed Halloween morning breakfast here before work, what a fun time! All the waitresses were dressed in costume, the place was busy, and it was football Sunday.

The service here seemed great, everyone we interacted with had a smile, other than our server. Maybe it was the sumo wrestling costume and makeup that was hiding her personality, but she was extremely pleasant and did her job well. 

The banana nut muffin I had was tasty, but lacked texture. I'm used to nuts in my banana nut muffins but none to be found here. Still a nice extra.

I went for a California Crepe and failed miserably. I usually really enjoy bacon, swiss cheese, tomatoes, eggs, and guacamole so why not have them all at once? It was ok, but the ingredients are diced to almost unrecognizable size and the guacamole is bland and smooth. It came with some Hollandaise sauce which was lacking in flavor also. No lemon, just yellow stuff,  and who wants that? The breakfast potatoes were what I ate the most of, they were seasoned well and not greasy but also were probably just frozen. 

My breakfast companion ordered the Prime Rib Benny which looked fabulous. It is blackened Prime rib thats cut small served with spinach and bell peppers over a toasted crossaint and topped with two poached eggs and Hollandaise on the side. The toasted crossaint is great but with so many toppings, it falls apart. A much better meal than mine.

I will return to Egg Works and make another attempt at the huge menu. It covers breakfast and lunch, including Hawaiian and Mexican inspired breakfasts, salads, seasonal items like pumpkin pancakes and carrot cake french toast.The banana nut muffin is absolutely delicious. :)Came here for dinner on the first night of my friend's bachelorette bash at the Wynn. Beautiful  decor and space - our party was seated right under the crystal dragon head.

The service was quick and very friendly which i noticed a lot throughout everywhere in Vegas - coming from nyc, you're not used it - my fellow new yorkers know what i mean lol 

Anyway on to the food - i got the pad thai which was ok - the portion was very big and they didn't scrimp on the shrimp - could easily feed 2 if you ordered an appetizer or side sushi. The prices were expensive as with anywhere in resort casinos - for the convenience and portion though - it wasn't too bad. For the food itself - i think we've all had better.This place has good food I think...I don't remember much.
I only know how much I paid...the next day using the Bank of America app...

Come here if you won a lot from gambling..otherwise stick with Earl's Sandwiches.Just so-so in my opinion.  We went for lunch, and their special is a great price.  Don't know where else I can get a sit down meal with soup, an egg roll, salad, and my main course for $8.

Service was also so-so, they didn't ignore us, but didn't come back to see how things were or if we needed anything.  Though the server was around if we really would have needed her.

Food was slightly bland, and not much seasoning.  Egg roll was burned.

Went at 11:30 and we were the only people in the place, and by the time we left ~12:15 there was only one more person.I love all the outlets they have at this location. The food is always fast but finding parking is virtually impossible.This place was decent BBQ. There wasn't anything that really stood out about this place. The pulled pork sandwich was kind of bland, along with the Mac and cheese. The potato salad I really liked.Same goodies as the Tempe location but much bigger space. This location is rather nice with lots of seating and an ambient feel. I really enjoyed my pasty but I know my parents weren't as impressed. I had the veggie rosemary chicken, yes Quorn veggie chicken is the best thing ever. The pasty had veggie chicken, roasted red peppers, roasted red potatoes and some brie; it was fantastic. We also had some pea soup, baked broccoli & cauliflower, and some oven chips. The broccoli was delicious (I have an aversion to cauliflower) and the chips were good too; remember chips=fries, crisps=potato chips. Both my parents were disappointed with their dips, the chicken pot pie came with some red wine gravy instead of chicken gravy and the chicken alfredo came with ice cold marinara, they were out of alfredo sauce. Bottled beer was a little pricey. I still love me some Cornish Pasty.I like fudge just as much as the next person but do I want to pay £4.85 for a slice... probably not although once in a while I guess it does no harm. It's great to see the fudge getting made and the staff always talk customers through the fudge making process... if you're interested that is. It's a pretty skilled process and a few years ago my mums attempt at making fudge resulted in the fire brigade being called to the house and the remnants of the fudge a black chalky disaster. The less said about that the better.

The huge copper cauldron where they stir the ingredients reminds me of witches brewing away at a potion but rather than making something to turn your worst enemy into a frog you get the sugary goodness of fudge and they're always giving away free samples!

My favourites are; After Dinner Mint, Strawberries and Cream and Vanilla.

Overall the Fudge Kitchen is definitely a novelty shop and unless you have money to throw away or the thought of having no teeth is appealing I'd save it for special occasions.I tried Red Lobster food  for the first time and I was not impressed with my order. I ordered the Broiled Seafood Platter TO GO and it was disappointing. My review relies mostly on the food. I was expecting restaurant food, not fast food. The fries were thin and chewy, the shrimp was a little bigger than a quarter but flavorful, and the scallops were just plain. Overall the food was not worth the price. 

I would give this location 2 stars but because my server/cashier provided great customer service, I'm giving 3 stars.Average bar food, but a lot of drink options including full bar and a ton of beers on tap.  Good place to watch sports too.This was pretty cool...

Got to roll the dice and won some fiecrackers!

The entertainment was cool...loved the Taiko Drummers and the martial arts students. Cool to see the young bucks open a can of whoop ass on the adults!

Fresh noodles were made right before our eyes by Chef Mark(NOT Chef Marc!)

Food selections were slim, wish there were more Asian vendors....unless you liked funnel cakes and potato tornado things....during Chinese New Year? Ummm. No...

Yelp was even there! I SUCKED at the bean bag toss, but I got a Yelp Sticker for my efforts...Woohooo! Overall, Just A-OK for me.....ALOHA!!!

YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(48/100) "Year of the Snake"I have mixed feelings right now about this place. I moved to Madison a few months ago and have been looking for a reasonably priced place to get a good haircut. I had an appointment with Hattie who did a fantastic job on my haircut but I was a little turned off by the political slant she posed to me regarding other businesses in the profession (whether I agree or not, it was a little forward for just meeting me) as well as her position on coloring my hair. I was told that if I couldn't afford to get my hair colored professionally then I should let my hair go gray. I thought is was quite inconsiderate considering that once again, she just met me and didn't have any information regarding my financial status or feelings about the subject. Lastly, yes there's more, I felt very pressured into the store products. This is typical for every hair salon but I felt especially pressured by Hattie regarding their product. Again, I loved the cut she gave me and would love to go back but I'm not sure if I'll be comfortable enough to do it considering all the negatives. 
P.S. they do provide beer free of charge for their customers but I didn't partake - the days calendar didn't allow for it - so I can't comment regarding the beverages.The staff at both this aloft are all great. The hotel is clean, has a great video system that allows you to plug in your toys to it, and it is in a decent location. (Next to an In N Out!) The bar area in the lobby is pretty well stocked with a decent, if limited, selection of beers, wines, and liquor. It has a good workout room.

However, the hotel gets three stars for the following: No complimentary breakfast, no drawers to stash your clothes and such, no ironing board in the room. They get points for style, but it comes at an expense.

UPDATE: There actually is an ironing board and iron in the room, it's just hidden where one would not think to look. The free pool table is also a nice treat. I added a star to the review for these reasons.

UPDATE: Just got back from what they call a pool. It is a bit small, and very shallow. (3ft!!!) Too shallow for my 6'1" frame to swim well, Also, it is the only area in the hotel where people can smoke, and the smell was thick there. I had to go to the desk to get some towels, as the ones there were all used and strewn all over the pool area. There were used drink cups and even a pair of sunglasses just sitting there on the side of the pool. It is obvious no one checks on the pool area very much. Taking the rating down to a three. It would be a two, but the kind staff boosted it.In terms of the quality of rooms, this place is stellar: bright and spacious, everything feels brand new. My room was a studio type, meaning I had a living room that transitioned into a bedroom, a full kitchen and a bathroom. The cons: no bar at the place and no mini fridge, so you have to buy the pricey food at the store by the reception desk or wait till the morning for their excellent continental breakfast!We stayed here in Sept and thought it was pretty nice so we booked a vaca through Southwest Vacations to stay here again since it was one of the cheapest. The rooms are nice and very modern and hi tech, nice big shower and tub and central location on the strip. I was surprised when we checked in that there was a new daily $22 resort fee.  it included access to the gym, WiFi, and 2 complimentary drinks. I wanted to use the gym when we stayed there before but it was $30 a day to get in since it was in the spa area, which I also thought was excessive.  But, i didn't even end up using the gym this time.  The WiFi sucked and I ended up using 3G on my iPhone anyway. And who needs free drink passes at a casino? They included free boarding pass printout at the concierge desk as a perk, but that was free last time. I can't complain about the staff since i hardly interacted with them.  Checkin was fine. The line at the concierge was long.  It took until 4:30pm for our room to be serviced.  

We ate at the breakfast buffet, which was great and pretty reasonable at $15. Everything from eggs benedict, made to order omelettes, sausages, congee and kimchi and pastires. We went before and learned that if you go around 10:30, you'll probably still be there when they change over for lunch  :) Had a late lunch at Julian serrano and prices there was reasonable too.  No ceviche on the lunch menu, but the gazpacho was best thing we ordered. The stuffed peppers were also very good. Tuna and raspberry bites weren't that great--overpowered by the raspberry.  We also went to the happy hour at American Fish. $5 is a great deal, but the selections were so so.  2 Oysters and 2 pieces of yellowtail sashimi were not bad but pretty hard to mess up. Lobster corndogs and fish and chips pretty uninspired.  The aioli and tartar sauces were the best parts. 
We didn't go to the clubs or eat anywhere else in CityCenter. 
Some pluses and minuses, but probably won't stay here again.Not a huge fan of the whole City Center development.  Kinda big and cold.  You can get great rates at Aria as a result.Beautiful hotel and casino but it left a lot to be desired. First off was the check in lines, now I am normally accustomed to VIP check in at other hotels in Vegas but since this was my first time here I had to use the LOOOONNNGG check in lines that moved painfully slow. It was not until later in my stay that I realized this is an MGM property and I would have qualified for a VIP check and comp room, room reservations failed to mention they were part of the M Life program. In my opinion this place is just too big, literally took a couple minutes to get to our room after we got off the elevator. Rooms were nice with great contemporary decor. Room was clean on the surface but upon closer inspection there was a large build up of dust on several peices of furniture in the room it was obvious that housekeeping just does a quick once over while dusting. My single biggest complaint is the dark rooms, lighting was worse than terrible. They are taking this "green" thing a little too far. I will not stay here again just because of the lighting in the room. About the best thing I can say about the Aria is it probably has the best location on the strip. A few other high points were a few of their restaurants, Javiers and She by Mortons which is located in the Crystals shopping area which is part of Aria.

I will probably not return to Aria unless I am very hard up for a room, too many other nice places on the strip that offer more for less that are just as nice or nicer.First off- the parking can be a pain since the entire complex stays busy before 12 midnight.  Beware. 

My first time I was lucky enough to go with a group of friends and they already had a table.  No wait but I've seen people wait over 30 mins on avg.  

The food- is good.  The service?  Needs work.  Few times servers and runners walked by me on the end of our big table and my water cup was empty.  I finally had to call someone over to fill it up.  My friends first were told that they were out of mango only to have another order come to our table 20 mins later...yep you guessed it- with mango!  

The place has a nice atmosphere to it.  So 3 stars for now.  
:)I liked Tandoori Times, but it is just too difficult to get to if you don't live in the area.

I thought the food was not the normal Indian fare that I have eaten:   

* Presentation was stepped up a bit.  
* Food quality was great.  
* I was a bit disappointed by the selelction of food, but I guess it is better to do a few key things well than offer a bunch of variety that is not as good.
* Tables and booths were dressed up a bit.

I would return here if in the area, but otherwise I prefer Maharaja Palace.Good set-up -- lots of TVs and decent odds but you have to come back to cash out. I wish the MGM properties were like Harrahs/Caesars where you can go to any of their properties.We took an elevator up to restaurant located on the 16th floor of the hotel.  This restaurant reminds me of the Voodoo Café at the Rio which the Marnell family owned back in the good old days. The restaurant occupies the entire floor with spectacular views of the valley through the floor to ceiling windows running the length of the restaurant.  

We were seated in a booth providing us with a clear, but distant view of the lights from the Strip.  We were not sufficiently hungry, after having apps earlier in the evening at Marinelli's to order entrees, so we settled on a few small plates.  The first was chicken lettuce wraps - spicy chicken, peanuts, scallions and water chestnuts with a black bean sauce. There was not enough black bean sauce to offset the dryness of the chicken.  We fared better with our second choice - crab cakes served over cole slaw with papaya sauce.After "Love" I wasn't expecting much.  Nonetheless, the show was enjoyable.  Not a lot of "Cirque" to it however.  The fact that we got our tix fairly cheap has colored my impression of the show: if I would have paid the full price, I would have been pissed.Had the frozen hot chocolate....similar to the one at William Sonoma..tasty and they make it in different ways.  The atmosphere is nice and lively great music not to loud but just right.  Had the BBQ and Blue Cheese Burger with sweet potato fries.  Excellent!!  Overall great experience and would recommend at least going there once.  BTW the waiter we had just happen to be from Lahaina, Maui.Direkt am Las Vegas Boulevard (Strip) gelegen, gehört dieses Restaurant zum Caesars Palace (http://www.qype.com/place/155631-Caesars-Palace-Las-Vegas) Hotel. Zwischen dem Hotel und dem Serendipity die Wasserspiele und Springbrunnen, die von der Außenterrasse wunderbar zu beobachten (und fotografieren) sind. Und zur anderen Seite das pulsierende Leben des Strip.
 (Siehe Foto unten) Gehobenes Burger Restaurant 
 so kann man das Serendipity am besten beschreiben. Obwohl  es gibt nicht nur Burger, die große Menukarte ist umfangreich und bietet auch jede Menge Pizzen, Omelets und andere Eiergerichte, dazu verführerische, große Desserts  Eis, Cremes und sonstige Naschereien.
Im Innenraum sind die Tische sehr eng gestellt, zu Essenszeiten ist es meist gerammelt voll und Gesprächsführung kaum noch möglich. Schöner ist es da schon auf der Außenterrasse. Der Blick auf den direkt vor einem liegenden Strip ist lebendiges Kino. Und mit einem guten Teleobjektiv lassen sich von hier aus unbemerkt die kuriosesten Fotos schießen. 
Für Las Vegas Verhältnisse lässt es sich preislich vernünftig essen. Wir waren mehrfach hier und haben  natürlich, wenn schon dann schon  Burger getestet: A.B.C. Burger ($ 16+), BBQ & Blue Burger ($ 16+), B.E.C. Burger ($ 17+), aber auch ein Omelet East West ($ 14+). Wir bestellten die Burger medium rare und erfuhren, dass dies hier pink genant wird. Die aus Süßkartoffeln hergestellten Pommes gibt es zum Burger dazu und schmecken vorzüglich. Soft Drinks heißen in den Staaten Sodas (Cokes, Fantas etc.) kosten $ 4. Und den Pott Kaffee bekommt man für $ 4, freies Nachschenken inklusive.
Zu Spitzenzeiten ist das Restaurant sehr gut besucht und man muss Wartezeiten bis zu 45 Minuten hinnehmen. Die Bedienung wie immer freundlich, aber bei vollem Lokal überfordert. Häufiges Warten ist leider angesagt, auf die Bestellannahme, auf die Lieferung des Bestellten und auch auf die Rechnung, die doch sonst in den Staaten immer so schnell auf den Tisch gelegt wird. 
Fazit: Zentral gelegene, preislich vernünftige Futterstelle. Wer Zeit mitbringt und diese Art Küche mag, der wird zufrieden sein. Gratis gibt es von der Terrasse das Las Vegas Spektakel. Gute drei Sterne.The portions are obnoxiously huge and I don't think the food was that good.  I have never been in a race to go back.Went for breakfast very delicious burger unlucky with the serverI believe in second chances but I'm still wary of eating their meat. So I stuck to my favorite: vegetarian tacos. The beans aren't mushy, the fajitas veggies have crunch and flavor, and they're cheap. My lunch was under $3 (one taco and a water cup). I'm not big on heavy lunches so this was a quick bite and it satisfied me until evening.I tried the Chicken and Sausage Jambalaya and it was decent.  I've had better, but then I've had worse.  The heat was good, but I wanted a little more flavor.  I added some Tabasco (they have several different kinds of hot sauce which is nice) and that added more flavor.  The food was also prepared well.

I had no problems with the wait staff and service was prompt.

I really liked the music they had playing while I was there.  It reminded me of my college days and being in a bar (though I wasn't drinking which was much different than when I was in college) seemed appropriate with the music.We were going to head to Woody's the other day since we were in the area visiting Costco across the street.  Unfortunately, since I ate like a pig at Costco (as per usual), we decided to skip.  Fortunately, the idea lingered and we went back the next day for a nice afternoon snack.  

This was our second time frequenting one of the new-fangled fro-yo joints...the ones were you do all the work, choose how much yogurt you get, put on your own toppings, etc.  All for a price that is lower than the usual fro-yo shop, right?  Right?  Hard to say at Woody's, as I never saw a single posted sign listing how much the yogurt was per ounce.  I guess I could have asked the employee that was behind the register, but he probably would have had to acknowledge my presence first before I could have a conversation with him (note: one customer was leaving as we got in, but otherwise, no other souls to be seen).  At least we were rung up in an orderly fashion when we were at the counter, and luckily, didn't interrupt him from whatever he was doing on his laptop or portable dvd player that he had on the counter.  He did thank us for coming in on the way out the door, so there's that.  I also rough calc'd the cost of the yogurt, and figured it is somewhere around $.35 - $.40/ounce.

The yogurt was good and I had a triple mixture of chocolate (which was called 'cable car' chocolate for some reason), peanut butter and banana.  I was trying to replicate the flavor of the limited edition Reese's Peanut Butter Banana Cups from a few years back and did pretty well.  

If I was rating solely on the yogurt/value, I'd probably give 4 stars, however, since the service was lacking and the signage was apparently invisible, I'm knocking it down to three.Just a quick review of a new Gelato shop in M's neighborhood that just opened.

The shop is bright, vibrant and spotless. The girl working the counter wa very helpful and patient as she expianed all the different flavors (which were in italian in the case). We tried a few different ones such as spicy chocolate, crema callenta(?) and snickers. 

We decided to have a medium half Rum Raisin and half Dulce de Leche. the portion was decent and not expensive for as fresh as the Gelato was (you can see right into the "kitchen" and the containers of ingredients).

Good overall, but as M put it "The flavor is not 'Pow' In Your Face!With all the selections of great restaurants in Vegas, it is hard to be stand out or be unique. For me Rare 120 was just a regular lounge steakhouse that served good food but nothing really over-the-top Vegas style. I came here to celebrate the acquisition of Zappos by Amazon and had some drinks prior to our meal at the bar. It's has a lounge atmosphere and very good for social gatherings. However, I go to Vegas to rage hard so lounging around at a steakhouse to me is completely unacceptable.

Back to the food. Solid offerings like a typical steakhouse. Great salads, steaks and desserts. Portions are not great but they do know how not to overcook steaks since most restaurants are more like Rare 250. For a place like Vegas, Rare 120 is nothing mind-blowing but solid nonetheless.Mixed emotions regarding breakfast at Tiny's this morning.  I wanted to like it but I know in my heart I won't go back.  Service was friendly and swift.   Loved being able to sit at the counter since I was a party of one.  Where I went wrong is telling waitress what I wanted rather than ordering a set menu item.  By the time I was through - veggie omelet, side of bacon and soft drink was close to $17.  Bacon was plentiful and flavorful.  Veggie omelet was boring.  Potatoes were not greasy but were bland.  If I pay that much for breakfast I want a memorable meal.The food is okay, the prices are really good.  I think their food is very greasy.  I love their shredded beef tacos!  Its definately a place you should try at least once.It is a very good looking mall but other than it was ok.   I already knew this place had  high end stores.  I buy a few high end things once in a while.  It was a place for us to window shop.  We came on a Monday afternoon and it was dead.  It is a nice place to look at.  It was very frustrating to get out of.  It was a bit confusing to navigate.Just arrived nice place not overly friendly server in the bar this wendsday   more concerned with texting , next up food ????? I ordered the burger 2 paddies  with a couple slices of cheese  and the sweet potato tots the food was 4 stars the  server 1 star ...you know what if your crabby go homeWent here today for a pedicure. My buddy & I had to wait quite a while but we weren't in a rush.

The two ladies who took care of us were fast and efficient. The sugar scrub & the hot stones were AMAZING. I didn't feel like they rushed through working on us. They chatted with each other mostly but it didn't hinder the work and was fine by me.

I would like to see more nail polishes to pick from. We spent $60 for the two of us (included add on services). Base price is $20 for pedicure + massage.Fresh spring rolls are some of the best I have had. Phaid Thai is pretty good. Over all it is the best Thai I have found on this side of the country. They have the condiment tray with all that you would expect, even white sugar. 

I love the woman in here at night who plays and sings live music. She is fantastic. For my non-thai speaking readers, there is something about hearing pop music hits being performed in a language that is not yours. Love hurts in Thai is amazing.Richard Pro here with another review.

No stranger to thai dishes, I ordered yellow curry with beef, red curry with shrimp, and the basil chicken. 

The yellow curry was sweet and creamy. I'm always a little overwhelmed by yellow curry so I didn't like it, but if you enjoy yellow curry, you'll probably like this.

The red curry was powerful and had lots of bamboo to munch on. I found it very agreeable to my palate.

The basil chicken was pretty bad. I got what appeared to be shredded chicken drenched in some kind of overpowering sweet sauce. I have no idea whether it was chicken, pork, or beef, so that says a lot about the dish. Anyway, it was pretty bad and I find it hard to believe it's the "most popular entree" as listed on the menu.

3 stars only because of the live entertainment. Otherwise, the food is really meh and you're paying like $12 per dish.

Interior is dark and loud because of the music. Comfy, I suppose. Service was outstanding.Thai food off the strip. Where the thai families get their grub on.

Some of the spicy dishes are pretttyyyyyy darn spicy, no joke. 
Service is awesome, they're always refilling your water. 

Came with my friend's huge family/relative group for dinner. Has to be legit if out of all the Thai restaurants, this is their choice off the strip to eat at. Everything tasted decent, nothing stood out too great except the spiciness of the noodle dish.I actually really enjoyed this place beside the service. My husband, his friend, his friends wife, and several other guys were all going out for a birthday celebration. Katie and I walked up and asked the bartender for a shot. After he gave us a shot he said, "come back for another, you will need one since you are rolling with five guys". I didn't really know what that meant, but I just brushed it off. We opened a tab and said we will use cash at the end to pay. At the end of the night the waitress, who acted very cocky all night, said very loudly to my husband and in front of our whole group, "you're card was declined". Then she laughed and walked away. On our way out the male bartender making the inappropriate comments said goodbye then began complaining that we didn't leave him a big enough tip. I understand working with the public can be frustrating, but this is your job and all the workers here were very young and unprofessional.Sadly, this Souper Salad has closed.     :-(I don't know Yelpers, $550 for 8 of us with tax & tip. I'm serious. Half of us had soft drinks, half had one glass wine, a few two. We shared apps. I mean come on, it's just spaghetti and pizza and salad.  Nothing at all spectacular about the food or place except the prices. You are certainly not paying for a view of the convention area hallway off the buffet. Our main server (Marie? Maria?) was absolutely excellent...friendly and professional.
My brother and I split the $10 side of Caesar Salad. It could have fit in a double shot glass.Unlike most people, I thought this was just ok and didn't blow my mind.  I got the tasting menu.  

- Market oyster.  I think they said it was a kumamoto, but I'm not entirely sure.  It had piquilo pepper, Tabasco sorbet, and aged tequila Mignonette.  It tasted pretty good.  Excellent start for the night.

- Chilled main lobster with a pumpkin flan, smoked apple, and a pecan-brown butter vinaigrette.  The lobster was pretty good.  It was soft and sweet.  Coupled with the flan and smoked apple, it was pretty delicious for the cold appetizer.

- Fois gras brulee.  Way too salty and was borderline difficult to eat

- Pan roasted sea scallop with jamon iberico, chopped romesco, and a creamy cauliflower sauce.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and were very tender.  Coupled with the different ingredients, you basically tasted scallop with some sweet kick to it.  So far, this was my favorite even though it wasn't that memorable.

- Herb crusted lamb saddle with roasted sweetbreads, Thomcord grape, and Chanterelle mushroom.  The lamb was pretty good with the herb crust on top.  It was cooked rare, so the meat was soft and very tender.

- 48 hour beef belly with caraway spiced heirloom squash and roasted quince.  If you've ever had braised beef in some type of reduction sauce, this is basically it with one exception.  The beef belly was VERY heavy in fat and flavor.  What I mean by this is that it's literally like eating a spoonful of roasted bone marrow with some strands of meat in it.  The beef belly was very tender, but it was just extremely fatty and rich.

- Green apple mousse with peanut butter cream, celery leaf, and autumn spice.  The green apple mousse reminded me of almond tofu in some ways.  I didn't really taste the green apple flavor that much for some reason.  There were some marshmallows that have been singed to the plate.  The peanut butter cream was a decent complement to the mousse though, but I found the celery leaves added absolutely nothing to the taste other than making the plate look nice.  The peanut butter cream was very powerful and was similar to eating caramel just with peanut flavors.  The long stick is some type of candy that cracks like a hollowed thin candy cane.  This dessert was just ok.

Out of everything I've had, I'd have to say my favorites were probably the pan roasted sea scallop and the herb crusted lamb saddle.  The fois gras brulee and 48 hour beef belly was slightly too rich for me for a 6 course meal.  The chilled main lobster was just ok, and the green apple mousse dessert was also just ok.This is a tough review for me. Food was a 4.5-5, but service was a 2. Let me give some examples:
* We arrived and our friends were at the bar, so the hostess directed us there. No problem... until she never came back to take us to our table. At least check? 20 mins later, we went back to her and she did take us to our table, but not AFTER...

* The bartender said he preferred for us to pay for our drinks at the bar AND no one offered to carry our drinks to our table. Does this make me a priss expecting this? This says to me that the management is a bit off on how they manage the team and likely tips.

* Once we sat, it was 15 mins until we were given menus. The waiter dropped them off and then disappeared without any explanation. Now, it would be different if they were packed, but they weren't. 

* One final example (but not the last remaining "really?" moment of the night), somm came over to pour our bottle of wine and barely engaged with me when I asked him about the wine. It was as if he had better things to do than talk to someone about wine. But he's the somm?!

OK, but let me talk about the food because despite the service, I actually did (and do) recommend Sage. My friends and husband had three courses, but being the food champ I am, I had four! :-D My favorite course was my husband's chestnut soup. It was wonderfully delicate and flavorful. The beet salad and my slow-poached egg received big thumbs up too. 

I had the veal cheeks for dinner and they were great. Loved the corn and hominy accompaniments. The table favorite was the lamb though.

We had three desserts for the table. I don't remember all three, but do remember a coffee chocolate dessert that was great!

Wine list was good. Great diversity and good price range, while not being overwhelming.Came here on a Thurs dinner time after Christmas and they're charging $50/person, ouch. Seriously, buffet at Vegas is becoming a joke now. What happen to all the good and cheap buffets they used to offer? Don't get me wrong, the food here is great and fresh but they don't have enough variety of food to charge at that price. If I want to pay $50 for buffet, I'll rather go buffet at Caesar's or Cosmopolitan. I've been here before during lunch and the only difference at dinner is that they added prime rib and oyster.  This is a $30 buffet at best. Food 4 stars and price 2 stars.Hole in the wall. Neighborhood bar. A-Ok, but not great. 

I stumbled in here last night in search of food with my friends. We went over to Zipps, sat down, and then discovered that their kitchen closes at Midnight, and Clancy's was our next best bet.

The drinks are pretty standard. Typical beer selection, and nothing too notable other than an average liquor selection. 

They do have food until closing time, which is a plus. You can get reubens, quesadillas, and most importantly, tots. Yeah. Tots. Hell yeah. 

I don't understand how an Irish themed place can have all this kind of stuff on the menu, but who cares. You come here to drink, and then eat because you have to. 

I'd come here again if I was in a pinch, but its certainly not a destination point.Delux is better. Not much cheaper, but the food tastes better. The wine is extremely overpriced, but I guess that is standard for city NorthWent 2 years ago to see my cousin get baptized. Hotel staff was very nice, but there was no coffeemaker in the room (you had to go downstairs to get it, which annoys me.) It was 113 degrees and the hotel pool was under renovation...stay somewhere else! 
BTW: breakfast, as at any Hilton, is outrageously expensive.I've eaten here like 3 times already since i've moved from California. Living in cities like SD, LA, and the SF Bay Area where I would constantly find myself eating at Pho spots over a million times, I was a bit scared to see what Vegas would provide for my Pho cravings.

So far I've stumbled upon this place and the Pho is ok. The broth has the usual flavor, but I think I've had more flavorful broths eating in spots like Pho Ca Dao in San Diego and Jasmin Garden in San Francisco. But I will say the large bowl of Pho can hit the spot when you have the craving.

I have also had their wonton egg noodle soup. Pretty basic. Noodles have a soft texture and the wontons break a part easily--making it a pleasant experience eating together. I'm sad they didn't have the spicy chili oil sauce they have in some Vietnamese/Chinese spots.

Their fresh spring rolls are good as well.

In a way, I think their food is a tad bit over priced compared to some mom and pop Vietnamese restaurants I love going to in California, but ehh i'll get over it. 

Another thing is that they have a limit of $10 when using credit cards. Since sometimes I usual eat by myself for dinner, it's kind of annoying.

So overall, the place is just OK in my book.Been a fan of this place through several names and owners. It's one of the few places in town to get a cigar, a pint of beer, and enjoy it inside.

The staff is very friendly, and they have a pretty good selection in their humidor. They carry a small but solid lineup of beers, including some of the local breweries. You can sit at the bar, grab a comfy chair, or sit at a table and watch the TV.

My only ding is for the atmosphere. Literally, the air. I like a cigar once in a while but am not a heavy smoker, and the smoke in there was on the edge of what I can stand. I had to fumigate my clothes when I got home. So definitely not for the weak of nostril.I have been to JP 3 times now.  Sadly I have learned to never go on a Saturday AM or you have to wait forever to be seated and to be served.  Go during the week and you will be fine.  I always go with a coupon or buy one get one free deal as they are a bit pricey.  The food is delicious!!!  The place is not very fance, very simple but the people always seem nice.Not happy. Mountainside just sent a letter saying they will charge all Members an annual fee of $25. Bad biz move. This wasn't mentioned when i signed up and is unethical. Bad move mountainside
The Mens Locker room smells like body odor.have been here since May 2013, the front staff is always polite. the neighborhood is quite and neighbors are pleasant and nice as well. 
However there are several issues, when something is needing to be fixed it takes them forever to fix it and you almost have to harp on them. had a toilet that broke and was leaking everywhere, had turned the water off to toilet and reported it to be fixed. took them 10 days to get to it and 4 contacts to keep reminding them. Lights now above covered parking spaces are out where I park and a down the row from me, reported it over a week ago and still not been replaced. makes for a dark walk in the middle of the night when arriving home from work. when we first moved in we had some missing pieces to the fridge and took them up until sept to get the replacement. have had tiles fall off in the bathroom and took them well over a week to respond to fixing it and when they did they replaced with tiles that don't match. and now we have had pest people in the complex today drilling holes for termite traps and low and behold it never got cleaned up and they still aren't finished. 
the do nothing to certain residents who let their dogs off their leashes and crap everywhere and not pick up after themselves. 
currently am frustrated with management being so lack on getting items fixed and responding to their tenants who pay a pretty penny to live here. 
All in all it's an ok place but have lived in better places who care more for their tenants and can't see myself staying here after lease is up. it's sad to say the least.nice selection of flavors and toppings like any fro-yo place. i found the yogurt to be a bit watery though...perhaps it was the flavors that i got (red velvet and original tart). i also find it weird that in order to try a flavor, one of the workers has to get you the sample. its awkward and makes it seem like they don't trust their patrons to get their own sample. i would come back if i was in the shopping complex but there are definitely some better places to go to for fro-yo.We stopped in to get a couple things serviced while we were shopping in Vegas.  The woman at the customer service counter was very rushed and wasn't paying attention to what we were saying.  She kept jumping to assumptions and leave to the back room based on the wrong assumptions.  Had she paid attention to what we were asking the experience would have been far better.I've been here on several occasions. Some nights are good, others downright awful. It depends partially on the crowd. When there's plenty of people on the dance floor, its a good time. When there's less people the experience tends to be disappointing. The drinks are overpriced. And the bartenders aren't always attentive, but this is tolerable when the crowd is good. Rumor has it that this place is slowly become more of a "str8 girl bar" and it's sort of true. Last time I went there was more straight couples there. I'm no hetrophob but I come to a gay bar in hopes of meeting cute guys who are also gay. I'll still go to this place because its otherwise the only gay club in town.acua is closedCute place, random location. Their popular sandwich, the Ben Franklin, was a standard turkey sandwich on a baguette, made unique by the red onion chutney and plating with Sriracha sauce. 

There's back garden seating, but it's a bit rocky and dusty with no real shade so on a sunny day you'd likely prefer the indoor coziness. If I were in the area in search of a watering hole, I might stop by again.Decent selection and prices but not enough staff if you need help.If you're the type that hates crowds or obnoxious "gangsta" types, don't come here on a Saturday. Typical Arizona strip mall bar that I was at previously on a Thursday and it was great.  Desiree (she said that was her real name) took care of us and  was terrific. Drinks are reasonably priced. I didn't eat here based on previous reviews.Went on Sunday during the Groupon rush, took 1.5 hours to get our food, during of which we got 2 mimosas before they ran out and had to upgrade to some beverages that were quite a bit more.

Food was ok, but considering the reviews prior I was a little let down. 
On one hand I can expect that things might have been off because of how busy they were but on the other hand that should be expected and planned for. 

As a Chandler resident we might make it back, but we will see.Mildly disappointing overall, based on one dinner visit and the high expectations I came in with from Yelp.  

For a fish dominated menu, the aquatic entrees the six of us had were generally pretty boring.  Smallish filets, surprisingly dull sides. Fish apps were up and down. 

Everything else was A-OK.  Good ambience. The owner smiled and made some small talk.  Our server was decent ( and drop dead gorgeous). Potables were potent - I gleefully endorse the Dark & Stormy, a rum and ginger beer concoction.  

I just wish the food was a little more passionate.All of my experiences at Hula's have been pleasant. Sitting at the bar or by the fire, it's a good atmosphere. The waitstaff are cool and the food service is timed nicely. I'm trying to find excuses to give more stars, but there is something just pulling back my fourth star and I think it's the sparkle. There is no sparkle for me.

The food is ok, but not awesome. Some things are done very well like the jungle sauce on the tofu or the fish on the fish sammie. But other things are not, like the actual tofu or the bread on the sandwich. Not a fan of the super sweet cocktails, and no wine specials for happy hour. To boot, I just don't get that feeling of soaking up the sweet Phoenix scene that's common to the Central/Camelback hot spot.

I always feel a little confused after coming here. My belly is full but my taste buds underwhelmed. Eager to be part of a cool neighborly social joint but not feeling the sweet CenPho vibes. The feeling is more like, [head cocked to the side, shoulder shrug] "That was aight."Fried pretzels? Appetizers during happy hour are good.Food and drinks were very good. Took about 20 mins to get a table on Sat nite. Comparable to Lindo's.

Kinda hi for Mexican food I think.Me and a friend enjoyed a flight of the on site brewed beer while watching the owner clean the tanks, prepping them for the next batch. This place offers a really fun experience, the bar faces the brewery, and when they aren't too busy the owner and employees happily mingle with those of us not lucky enough to brew and sample beer for a living. If you want to eat, you will have to order in (they don't mind if you bring food in) although I think they occasionally have hot dogs, and they put out bowls of a pretzel sort of mix. 
They offer several good beers, their light American Lager is probably the most refined tasting local brew I have had and would be super good on a hot summer day, although lacking in character for most occasions. My current favorite would have to be the Pumpkin Pooch: their seasonal Hefe with a very subtle pumpkin flavor. I plan to return when not on my motorized two wheeler and give the Barley Wine a go. 
I currently have a couple beefs with Sleepy Dog: I think there is room for another brewery in town, so when one of your beers is compared to a "competitors" there's no need to get offended, especially if we like theirs too! Also, maybe it is my midwestern bias, but a real bar needs beer nuts.Thankfully they serve Malibu or I don't think I would be coming back to eat. The servers were so-so. The bar staff thinks they are in Hollywood all waiting to be discovered. They have more time for themselves than they do to wait on you. 

Atmosphere is whimsically modern meets gaudy Victorian. I think I should trademark that name. 

Food was okay. Got a cheeseburger the first time and a $78 Kobe steak the second time. It was a $10 Albertson's steak, people. And medium rare was served almost well done in my book. Not a good sign. 

What made it fun was definitely the company, great weather and the patio. Generous seating outside with a nice buffer between the patio and the parking.Service 2 stars
Food 4 stars

Came here to celebrate an early Valentine's Day. My plum ginger cocktail was exceptional, we visited 4 other lounges this night and it was my favorite cocktail by far. They ran out of the short rib and BREAD. We asked a few times and finally saw it come out to other tables. It's the principle here. At least dessert was on the house.Love and HATE this place. Great deals on hard to find items. The age discrimination with having a manager verify my ID, ask me how old I am, and document it each time is VERY irritating. "Yes, I'm still 21, like I was yesterday I told one of the managers". (Especially when I am in the store on average 3 times per week.) Even 2 days in a row! Show me the law or documents that states they are allowed to harass me for my age. When will it stop? When I'm 22? 23? ID people at the door if you're going to hold me up at the check-out. Its annoying and makes me feel un-welcomed.FINALLY made it out to the WHP this past weekend.  The last time I had been out here was to check out the Sheraton for a wedding site.  A lot has changed since then.  

The new hotel/casino is right off the freeway.  There are exit lanes that turn into RTO lanes, that make their own lanes....this place knows how to get people in.  I was quite impressed with their parking lot setup.  I didn't even try and attack the garage and just parked in the open lot.  

Inside the casino is swank.  This is, by far, the nicest casino in AZ.  There are tv screens everywhere, tons of machines, and plenty of places to eat and drink.  Maybe the coolest addition from the old casino is the electronic roulette table.  Very cool.

Unfortunately, there aren't enough multi-game machines, aren't enough anything inside the smoke-free room, and the waitresses suck.  Also, for a new casino, I felt like the vent system was pretty weak.  I find the more southern Casino Arizona to smell less like smoke than this new joint.

Anyways, we had a good time.  It is better than the old Wild Horse Pass and it is better than the casino on the 202.  I'll probably keep going to Casino Arizona though...especially once they open their new hotel.It might be easier to just list their regular-priced schedules, since their happy hours are extensive. Half-priced drinks and half-priced pizza (surprisingly good with a super thin, crispy crust) are available 3-7 p.m. And again 12mn through 5 a.m.  They have around 20 beers on tap and regular price for 32oz is around $7 and $3.50 at happy hour. The ambience is pleasant enough, the furniture comfortable enough, with flat screens scattered liberally throughout. Nothing to write home about, but a perfectly adequate neighborhood bar.i ordered the sweet and sour pork, the pork tasted kind of funny not sure if it was pork or not.Review for the $9.99 Groupon deal for five jello shots.


Not much to say really. Groupon was easy to redeem. No line around 10 PM. Got the jello shots in grape and apple.. Wasn't really that good.I'm so mixed on the Forth Floor. The views are really fantastic...some of the best you will find in the capital city. The staff was very friendly, and as a plus or minus you are steps away from all the high-end shopping that Harvey Nichols offers.

That said, I was a bit disappointed with the food itself. Edinburgh is such a great foodie city with excellent well priced restaurants, whereas Harvey Nichols charges well Harvey Nichols prices...rather over priced for what you get. The food wasn't bad by any means, it was just rather average...you could be well in any high-end department store restaurant. My salmon looked a bit pre-packaged, and the steak was cooked properly but really was just ok. I did enjoy my side of mixed greens though!

The crowd at dinner was also rather sparse for a Saturday night---not happening at all.  I can see coming back here for lunch especially for the views, however, I would skip returning for dinner.It was too small for the amount of people in there, and I have to say that the talent that came out to the club was eh....

The sound system and lighting is alright, but the bottle service area was too close to the floor there wasn't enough space to relax.I've been craving a good Baked Pork Chop Over Rice but this was not it. There was a lot of fried rice. They did not use enough eggs in the fried rice and the peas were not boiled first and were hard. They should have put more pork chop since there was so much rice. 

The staff was super nice. I was offered tea or water by two different people as I waited for my order. The place is clean and has a big lcd playing chinese karaoke. 

I will definitely come back and try some of their other dishes!Located in the GVR Resort and Casino, this frozen yogurt place will satisfy your sweet tooth.  There isn't a huge variety of flavors but you and swirl two of them together... hence the name U Swirl.  They have nice signage beneath each flavor which lists the nutrition information.   That was great to see.   Toppings were the same that you would find at most yogurt places.   There weren't a lot of fresh fruit options but plenty of sugar options!   

The gentlemen working here was very nice.  He greeted us when we walked in and very friendly checking us out.   U Swirl is a pay by weight.  It wasn't the cheapest of frozen yogurt  but then again I wasn't sure how much the hubby had in his cup.  

So if I happened to be there and wanted a frozen treat, I wouldn't hesitate to stop in but I wouldn't go out of my way to have it.Food here is ok not 4-5 star quality.It is worth coming in to browse for deals. I found an LED flashlight for $.99 - the useful life of the product is yet to be determined. 
The one thing I noticed that was not presented well was the travel size shampoo. It looked liked the product spilled over the entire shipment and no one bothered to wipe the bottles clean before putting them on display.

You can find some decent things in this place - so three stars.made reservations @3pm tea lounge is on 23rd floor which happens to be the lobby as well. it wasn't too noisy but enough to be a chill environment. small little area about 8-10 tables i think. service was nice waitress came by to refilled our cups.

a bit pricey but there's no where else u can drink hot tea n stare at the strip thru a huge window. we hunged around for about an hour just chatting and sipping tea, which is the whole point its a lounge! didnt feel rushed which was nice. Great presentation!! 

ordered the lychee green tea yummy! nice aroma and the mandarin blossom tea which i thought was ok. the finger food foods/desserts wasn't bad, i do love the scones i wanted more! the clotted cream and jams were very good as well.The curry was ok, I had to order the one served inside a pineapple, it looked better than it tasted though. Maybe next time I should try the other curries. The pork jerky was excellent though, I would definitely come back for that. Service was pretty good too and the staff was really nice.The reason for the three stars - the service.  Horrific service!

We arrived at 3:30 pm, looking for a light snack as we were traveling with another couple who liked to take the afternoon in their room.  We were having dinner in a couple of hours at horrible Rio, so glad we stopped and enjoyed this meal.

When we finally got  a waiter, we ordered the bravas - incredibly excellent, the tuna cones - not bad needed more pepper, a mixed antipast sausage plate which had some spanish chorizo that just melted in my mouth.  I wanted seconds, thirds and fourths!

I also ordered a white sangria, not bad, very refreshing.
Hubby ordered the beer.  Here is where it starts to go downhill.

First waiter does not come to table for a solid 10 minutes.  They're all standing around talking.  The place was empty by the way.  
Second, had no clue what they had on tap.  Totally absimally clueless.
Brought over a menu of drinks, had to call him to come back after another 10 minutes went by!! 

We get our tapas, where the drinks?  After being halfway through our meal, we get my Sangria, no beer.
We finish the meal, no one ever comes back to the table to check to see how we're doing, refill the water, nothing. 

We ask for the check, a different waiter comes by and guess what - the beer is present.  So we ask for it to be removed we never got it.
After some scoffing and a 'what?, Well let me bring it to you now, its sitting on the bar".  Excuse me?  Its been there for at least 10 minutes.  You can keep it.

The two waiters now start arguiing and manager has to remove the drink.  We paid and actually thought of returning and sitting in the bar, but frankly were too tired to make the trek for bad service.

Great food though.I got upsold by the person who greeted us right after we sat at our table and ordered the paella for 2.  doh!  $45 for paella that had chicken and was not that great at all.  Mistake.

Otherwise, the tapas were good, not great (except for the heirloom tomatoe tapas, that one was sooooo good).  Everything here was good, nothing too impressive and nothing a disapointment, except the paella.More like 3.75 stars really, but I'm rounding down cause of the prices. But I guess it is Vegas. I mean the food was delicious, but the prices were steep. I love tapas and Spanish food. But $45 for their seafood marinara... Steep!! It was yummy and there was a lot of seafood in it, but still. Most tapas dishes ranged in the prices between $10-18. And the dishes were pretty small too. The goat cheese stuffed dates, really yummy but $12.50 for three pieces. The braised short rib, one rib for $16. 

And the desserts were alright. At $8 a dish I was expecting heaven in mouth. The desserts were definitely unique - pistachio tart, almond cake with almond ice cream. But it didn't have that "you're totally worth paying for" quality. 

If I were to write a review based on the deliciousness of the food, Julian Serrano would get 4 stars. However, my review is based on the overall dining experience.I am wicked disappointed with 20 Lounge, and it sucks, because it could have been the beginning to a really great relationship for us.

This past Friday me and the rest of my BFF's bridal party made our way to 20 Lounge to get a mani/pedi for the wedding. We had all purchased the Groupon deal and thought it was the perfect way to spend a day together relaxing before the rehearsal. 

The place is really cool and modern, the people are nice, they serve you wine... but all 5 of us we completely dissatisfied with the actual service. 4 of us went with french mani/pedi and the lines were uneven, the white tips were bumpy, and were chipping within hours. I found myself thinking that I could have given MYSELF a better manicure and it was $60!!

I'm giving 20 Lounge 3 stars because I do like the environment and they take good care of you when you are there, but minus two stars for the crappy job they did on our nails and for being overpriced.

Smiley Nails, I will never betray you and your $35 mani/pedi again!I've only been here once, but I didn't get what all the hype is about.  It's good, better than Subway, but that's not saying much.  At least their open late, and on Sundays.Groupon Groupon Groupon

A newly renovated bowling alley was the reason for the visit. With an extension to the casino portion of the building separated by four glass doors. It was cosmic bowling night. 

We were not sure if the pin resetting was due to the fact that we were there for hour play as opposed to a per game play, but nonetheless. $10 pitcher beers, $5 mixed drink.. wasn't so bad on a Thursday night. 

I thought the facilities were clean, the restroom was kept, and the bar was nice with the TV's to keep you entertained. Not to mention the bouncy bartender!

Would come back again.I can't say it's the best place I've stayed in but it was ok. Our room had a suite area with a sofa and fridge so the entire room itself was pretty spacious. But the bathroom was very small! It was nice that the sink was outside so someone could use it if someone else was in the bathroom. 
I didn't spend much time there so I don't have any complaints.Still not in love. Tried it many times and the fries are plain and the burger is ok for fast food but doesn't keep me coming back. Sorry to the diehard fans, but I think there are better burger joints out there.Only been here once so far, and I'd like to return to sample some of their other items (the salad I had was rather delicious).  I was also thrilled to see AZ Stronghold wine on the menu.  However, I felt a bit out of place.  The atmosphere was usually one that I love, but I just couldn't get into it there.  Maybe it was the baseball playing in the back ground, or the way some of the other guests eyed me and my table mate, but I felt a little too awkward to be really comfortable.  As far as the food and service went, awesome.  Just got a funny vibe from the place.Every time I've gone here, usually week nights, there's always an initial and pungent smell of vomit possibly from last nights lets-go-have-dinner-turn-crazy-night-on-the-town vibe I get from this place.

Once I overcame the smell and was seated from the strangely under-dressed hostess, our waiter came to get our order in an even stranger bandana jean look that was very curious.

We started with the pretzel Gouda fondue appetizer.  Very gooey and delicious as expected, maybe too much salt, but gooey and delicious.  He had the salmon and I tried the French Dip.  The salmon was delicious and none was left on the plate.  I'm a sucker for French Dips, the one's that melt in your mouth and have a great au jus.  I was sadly disappointed here.  To start, a strange mayo based dressing is applied liberally giving the, what I would assume is the most tender and juicy, roast beef a strange creamy taste and texture that is not pleasant.  The au jus is a strong french onion soup that does not go well with the sandwich. 

Overall I felt the place tries too hard to be different, too hard to be the cool place in town.  The food was a 4 (the salmon was truly excellent), the environment was a 2...I split the difference.05/01/13

It has been awhile since I checked out CD's happy hour, so I invited a coworker to join me to see what's new.  Looks like CD's done away with their cheese and charcuterie check list and just added a cheese plate.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=bKR19j9BvpE4gSwGo-CmQA#bKR19j9BvpE4gSwGo-CmQA  Not bad- enjoyed the cheese (one tiny rectangular piece) and thumb-sized serving of jam, the Marcona almonds and delicious almonds were plentiful, and the grilled asparagus were all good.   Didn't really care for the bland breadsticks, and what's with the measly serving of bread (2 tiny pieces)?  I refrained from asking for more until the very last second, and I felt like my server didn't like the request, but she recovered very fast.  Just don't give me the eye-roll and we're still friends.

Draft beers were $3, I think, and that included Four Peaks' Kilt Lifter, but that's not what I ordered.  Instead, I tried a glass of the sauvignon blanc- quite nice!  Too bad glasses of wine aren't included in the happy hour menu...

I also ordered the chopped salad, of which the bartender rattled off a list of ingredients and sounded very sure she named everything, so I asked that a couple be omitted.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=-_VmkG-T6ywOWBoVMb5Vhg#-_VmkG-T6ywOWBoVMb5Vhg  Either I missed her mentioning a specific nut (I doubt it!), or she forgot.  Was able to pick most of them off, but still managed to eat a few that were hiding between the greens.  Salad was OK, nothing spectacular.  Probably wouldn't order it again, unless I was running short on veggie servings for the day.  Coworker tried the Korean Beef on a Stick app.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=mMBaBHk1OEvp2bspuUtl5A#mMBaBHk1OEvp2bspuUtl5A  The menu didn't lie, it was one stick of Korean beef.  For $6, I thought the price was a bit too high, but my friend really enjoyed it.  

Based on what we tried today, I'd say it's best to just stick with the dinner menu.  However, I am not giving up on HH, yet, and I plan to try two or three more items soon.

Note: Happy hour menu prices online needs to be updated.I got the Italian hoagie and was waiting to be impressed... but was disappointed.  This place advertises itself as an Italian deli but the bread tasted like it came out of a bag and my sandwich had no spice to it at all, except for the pepperoncini on the side.

Nice place and great outdoor seating.  The staff was so nice that I might have to try something else before I make any final decisions.Garth tried to be too much a comedian & not as much a multi-platinum singer. Even the most experienced comics become boring after an hour or so...

Enjoyed the history of his influences, but dragged out too much. Would have preferred more Garth songs instead. Also, missed the band. Cutting costs? Guitar seemed to be too loud & sometimes overshadowed his singing.

Too many references to word 'people' & too much back & forth walking on stage.

Good news is he still has a voice. And, IF he gets back to being an entertainer of the year singing performer, I would pay to see him. However....if he's launching a new career in comedy & pub style venues, I will stick to the locals for a much lower price.We were in Vegas for a friends wedding and went to see a show at the Imperial. We all had been wanting to try the Hash House A Go Go, so about 15 of us went upstairs. The hostess, not very friendly, asked how many, we told her 15, she looked at us like CRAP, well I can't put you all together and we said fine split us up. The hostess came back and said I can take four now, and she slowly seated the rest of us which ended up being about 10, the others decided not to eat there. While we were sitting she was talking to the bus boy about sitting 4 of our friends in the booth next to us, it sounded like they really didn't want more customers.
Our waiter was not very personable kind of like the hostess, I guess they all  have the same training. While we were eating we noticed a loud noise well it was coming from the large section of the restaurant that they had close off to clean and the noise was the equipment. I personally think you don't start using noisy equipment until the customers leave. When I went to the bathroom I checked the sign to see what time it closed and we were there done and hour before closing.
The food on the other hand was great, very large and almost worth the terrible service. Don't know if I would go back the the hotel it's self is dirty and way too much smoke, maybe if we had a complete fabulous experience I would make more of an effort.After reading all of the wonderful reviews for Hash House a Go Go, this was first on our list for Las Vegas. We were staying at the MGM Grand, and it looked like this was about a mile down the strip so we chose to walk. 

The weather was grand, and the walk nice. We stopped along the way to do some shopping and eventually ended up at the restaurant. I had the Roasted Chicken, garlic, onions, asparagus and rosemary. The portions are large. Of the various ingredients, the asparagus was outstanding. The rest was fair.

Service was excellent, although the server seemed a little contrived and over the top. But, she was nice. 

We tried it, they just opened one in Chicago, but I think that I was not impressed enough to go out of my way to try the one here. Sorry.I stopped by with a few others and the girls there were not very friendly towards us at all. Perhaps it was because they were all friends, but I sort of feel if you have potential buyers coming in, you should probably pay a little more attention to them than your friends coming in for a chat. 

Besides that though, the vintage clothes really were not my cup of tea. Mostly 70s, 80s, some 90s mixed in. There are hand sewn "indie" pieces, but then again those weren't my cup of tea either. Prices were really reasonable for what the clothes were.

I prefer vintage that's much older, 1930s-1940s-1950s, so if you're looking for that, this place wouldn't be the place to get it. 

But for what Blueberry offers, the prices are great, but there really wasn't anything that special about this shop.My sweet tooth was yelling at me! I had to stop in. Four times (to date) and each time I try something different. Other than the cheese curds (which where just ok) each visit was for the frozen custard. 
VERY RICH and CREAMY a little goes a LOOOOONG way. I have tried a small berry sundae, a pineapple malt, and a small black cherry cheesecake concrete mixer. 

The sundae by far has been my favorite. I love the simplicity, the berries were not overly sweet, strangely artificially thickened. 

The malt was nice and malty which I really appreciated and was rather thick even after melting slightly. 

Now the concrete mixer was the richest of the rich. Maybe it was because I decided to go with a cheesecake flavor (to which you can add any other fruit or topping flavor). It was very tart like cream cheese (about as tart as a good Greek yogurt) with small bits of graham crumbs swirled through and of course the blackberry flavor.It's been a while since I've had Smashburger and I'm finally getting around to reviewing it, but I remember my experience.  

I think if their whole concept and even store name revolves around the word "Smash", they should design their store to reflect that.  SHOW US THE SMASHING!!!  Five Guys & In-N-Out, who I would place together in the same category as Smashburger, both have exposed kitchens showing us how clean and freshly prepared their food is.  

Next, their burgers are really really greasy.  I think the best beef to fat ratio for a patty is 80/20.  I don't know what their ratios are, but just because they use 100% Angus beef, it shouldn't equate to more grease.  It should equate to more flavor.   And their 'highest-quality-cheeses" wasn't anything special.   And I really really tasted.  I really did.

Their rosemary/olive oil fries adds another couple of bucks to your meal, which is north of 10$ dollars for a meal.  They're not as good as they sound.  Next time, I'll stick with the regular fries.  

I will go back to try again, but so far, Smashburger is just 2 1/2 stars in my book.  The rounding-up because I'm just nice. :DThis place has been here for over 25 years. They have had good times and bad times. Right now must be a good time. 

The place look great, fresh and clean. 
The service was ok but the manager dude was great. 
The food was good and they have some decent choices now. 

We had a fish plate with 2 big filet's, slaw, frys and hush puppies. I had 2 fish tacos and lobster bites. 

The plate was shared by both kids and they eat the majority of it and liked it. I had the tacos and while there are no good fish tacos in AZ these did alright. I would prefer not so crusty breading though. The lobster bites are fantastic but be sure to share them as the butter flavor get a little over powering and gross after 15 or so. 

Over all it is better the McDonald's and cheaper.I'm being critical here. The Mastros in Costa Mesa, Ca, is my favorite steak house anywhere. The Mastros Ocean Club in Laguna Beach has an awesome coastal location. This Mastros is in a mall. Enough said.The pizza was really good, also had a dinner salad which was kind of so-so. I knocked off a couple of stars for inconsistency. I called there a couple of weeks ago for a delivery and was told they didn't deliver that far, but when I called this Saturday suddenly they did. I wonder what will happen when I call next time.....Cant go wrong with the wings or pizza, but the flatbread pizza was amazing!With all the hype about the Cosmopolitain, we were really hoping for something way wonderful.  We stayed here overnight, on the way north from Spring Training.

Arrived on a Saturday at 3:30 pm, to about 40 people waiting to check in, and none looking very happy.  Hmmmm, not a good sign.  When we got to the desk, in 20 minutes, we were told our room wasn't ready.  Say, whaaaat?  The desk kid was very apologetic, embarassed, contrite.  All the things you'd expect after catching a puppy peeing on the floor.  

But that didn't help us with a room.  He suggested we go have some dinner and wait for our room.  'scuz me, but we just spent 8 hours in a car.  I wanted a shower, and to relax before we hit the casino and out for the night.  He told us it should be less that TWO HOURS till our room was ready.  (!!!!!)

So we headed for the closest bar and grabbed a couple drinks.  Happily, our room was ready in less than an hour.  We got to our room, called for our luggage and waited 40 more minutes for it to arrive.......

The room was nice, airy and clean.  The bath very well-appointed and comfy.  Dual shower-heads, big tub.  If you don't want to watch someone in the shower, close the blinds.

The "kitchen" space consists of a Nazi-style snack bar and mini-fridge, all full of stuff you'll get charged for if you fondle.  Fair enough, but what if you actually bring in your own cherished bottle of wine or Blue Label?  There's not enough room for a toothpick, much less a six-pack.

I fear that in the rush to be edgy and provocative, the management forgot that actual comfort may be welcomed.  There's a great balcony, overlooking the Bellagio and the strip.  An excellent place to relax a bit and watch the evening come up.  But there's only one small lounge to sit in.  What if you're there with another person or two, they supposed to sit on the pavement or take turns?  And, there's not a comfy chair to be had.  Sigh.

When we checked out, we called to get our bags brought down.  No one was availiable to do that - at 0800 on a Sunday?  i think we were the only ones awake then on the property.

One final thing - when we checked out, we found that a $600 charge had been put on our card as a deposit.  Without telling us.  I can see $100 or so, we may have raided the mini-bar or something, but $600?   Ridiculous.

Staff was all uniformly welcoming, helpful and professional.  Great people watching, and enough interesting stuff on-property to keep you there all weekend.  But it's a bit like hoping your screw-up of a little brother has his act together, but knowing he doesn't.

After being open over a year, the bugs should be better worked out with staffing.  It's just not a good thing to piss off your customers when they first check in.  And from previous Yelps, this seems to be an on-going problem.  I'd go back there again, but not for a while.  In the mean time, we'll be at the Trump.  The rooms are amazing and the service impeccable.Need some people workI accidentally ordered the 24" in pizza, biggest pizza I've EVER bought. The 2 of us ate on it for the whole week. 13 huge pieces. The place is a whole in the wall, but definitely convenient.I dont bank with this bank, but when I go in to cash checks .. always friendly but I feel like they are always trying to get me to switch to their bank and I really DO NOT like the fact that they charge $6 to cash checks.Short and simple. Love the store, don't care for the workers. Some days I'll have one that actually wants to help, but I've had worse service.I was in the neighborhood a couple of weeks ago and got a manicure and pedicure. They have a weak magazine selection, charge extra for callous removal (really?) and my technician tried to upsell me 3 times to a $50 package. I am not likely to go back.Not the best course I have ever been to but will do for our extreme weather conditions.  Not very clean.I really wish there was a close alternative to this fabulous Freddy. When you pay $23 for car wash plus a $5-$6 tip you expect everything to be done. I'm not talking a full detail, but I expect there to be clean carpets and no streaks on the car and the windows wipe down thoroughly. I cannot understand why every time I go here I have to ask for these things to be done. And when I do, I get attitude from every employee including supervisors. On the positive side they are not thieves, as I've experienced at other carwashes around town and everybody for the most part is friendly and in a good mood. After specifying what needs to be finished, I do roll off the lot with a very clean car.Nice lunch spot in the Fashion Show Mall that is close to where I work. Everytime I have eaten here the food is always fresh.The sesame chicken and the teriyaki are very good and I like their rice. I judge Asian places on how well they can make rice. I know this is weird but I can't stand rice that isn't soft and fluffy. If I can't pick it up with chopsticks it is a no go for me. It seems recently they have been offering a small sushi selection. I ordered some inarizushi and was surprised when the clerk told me it would be about 5 minutes. Not only did they make it right then but they made it the way I like it. Inari needs sesame seeds and they did it right!Imagine my surprise last fall seeing a sign that said "Red Mango coming soon" on State St... in Madison. Ok. Wait, really? Random... Madison? A RED MANGO?!?!?!?!?! WHAT??! *quadruple takes* Needless to say, I was a weeeee bit excited. I've loved Red Mango since I was first introduced to it years ago, back in the motherland. I mean, fro-yo that's not too sweet, piled on with delicious toppings? What's not to love?!

Serendipitously, I was also on that side of campus on the first day Red Mango actually opened in Madison. So. It's a bit small. And not surprisingly, overrun with fobs (yes, even within hours of its opening. In January. Pretty positive it was in the negs that day). But I was impressed to see pomegranate seeds available as a topping, along with pomegranate yogurt... Unfortunately, that machine wasn't up and running when I was in. Haven't been back since but can't wait to go back and try it. 

yessssssss. I'm totally drooling in anticipation.I came here for my friend's birthday.  She wanted to do something chill but had heard about their lobster rolls so that's what we got!

Yay:
-Lobster rolls: nice buttery rolls, perfectly cooked lobster with a side of chips.  I'm not a huge fan of lobster because it can get overwhelming and tough but they cooked it really well here.  Plus the ratio of mayo to the lobster was good as well.

Other:
-Loaded chips: Freshly made potato chips, with bbq beef ragu, cheese and some sort of cream sauce.  The bbq in this is definitely strong. Get this if you like the taste of bbq.  The beef ragu was scarce, barely had any.  One of my friends didn't even know there was beef in it and we had already gotten through almost half.  It's a huge order though, so enough to share.  I had to ask for extra cream sauce to tame the bbq flavor.  Chips were nice and crispy, didn't seem oily.
-Service: it was okay.  Our waitress wasn't that attentive.  It was kind of loud in there but it seemed like every time we would try to flag her down or say something to her before she walked off, we were ignored.  She also spilled one of our drinks on a portion of a table and never cleaned it up even after she said she was going to come back to clean it.I've been here a few  times while attending events for work and staying at the Aria next door. I like the beer selection and the bartenders are good. Beer prices are crazy though! Come on, $12 for a Palm? I do realize this is tourist country but so is where I live in Orlando and a Palm here is in the $5-6 range. Best time to go is during their happy hours when things are priced at "normal" levels (1/2 off). Food was consistently good but also overpriced. Almost $20 for their PUB Burger.  I will say I had my best beer ever here (The Abyss) when I went last year on a recommendation from the staff. Would be a solid 4 stars if not for the prices.Not a great whole foods, seems like a wannabe whole foods, not alot of selection and set up weird, they need to do something to change the feel of the store3.5 stars for me.  My first thought upon walking in was "wow, it's small."  Not a bad thing necessarily.  Could be a good thing in fact.

I ordered a "Blushing Lady" cocktail (gin, Citronage, lemon juice, simple syrup, and a splash of sloe gin).  I'm pretty sure it was served in a dribble glass because I seemed to have difficulty actually consuming it.  But what I did have was perfect for me, and I would like another.

I also opted for the special that evening which was a tenderloin sandwich with poblano, swiss, watercress, and charred onion.  While the poblano and onion sold me on it, I didn't quite get the swiss and watercress.  It was good, but could have been better with another cheese IMHO.  Also tried the herbed fries (delicious) and the mac 'n cheese (not as delicious).  The mac 'n cheese was good, but lacked the gooey cheesiness I crave.  We finished with warm doughnuts and salted butterscotch.  Doughnuts were fantastic, and it's hard not to like the butterscotch, but the "salted" part was missing.  A touch more please.

I had kinda forgotten about The Grind, but now that I'm reminded of it, it's worth a second visit.I always get stoked to see late-night Mexican food that isn't Filiberto's. It's good enough, portions are big, but there's nothing it does particularly well. Tacos are meh. Burritos are so-so. Carne asada fries don't need to have a tub of sour cream. And food eeds spice of some sort, not just salt and 5 little cups of salsa! At least it's clean, and the guac is legit. 

It's far from the most delicious spot in the area, but at 3am it can be trusted. Isn't that what's really important?I had a really good burger today.  Mushroom and swiss, juicy burger, lots of mushrooms, good bun!  Yep, good burger.  The fries were ok - a little too salty for me.  My daughter's chicken strips/fries were the typical kid's meal fare.  The whole place wasn't as clean as I'd like considering they weren't busy and they had lots of staff.  But I will go back for a burger.Was not expecting much from a sushi spot in AZ and if one of our friends wasn't about to take the 9 month no sushi ban to have a kid we probably would have kept driving.  This place is really nice inside and has plenty of patio seating also.  The service was great and the food was not phenomenal but decent.  The lollipop sushi was refreshing and fresh but most of the menu was a little on the steep side price wise.  Good location, which is what brought us in being front row at some open air shops.  If you have to eat sushi in AZ then Stingray is a viable option, being open later than most other spots helped also!Quick review: Stopped in for lunch today, with the intention of sampling their Friday Fish special. $7 gets you 2 pieces of deep fried cod, fries, slaw, roll, and soda.  Fish was solid - nicely done, especially for the price and speed.

Detailed review:

I'd never visited the Middleton Sport Bowl prior to today, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  We arrived exactly at noon, parked, and made our way to the bar, where we found two seats and were promptly greeted by a bartender.

We both ordered the lunch special - 2 piece deep fried cod plate with fries, slaw, tartar, dinner roll, and soda.  The bartender took our order and came back with a complimentary bowl of popcorn, which was a nice surprise.

Plates arrived about 10 minutes later - the fish was appropriately sized, as were the fries - no imbalance, and portions were fair.

The fish itself had a flavorful beer batter that was a little thicker than what you'll typically find at most places, but it was delicious and I welcomed the extra crunch.

Inside, the fish itself was a tad watery with just a hint of grease - not anything outrageous, but just enough to sense that it was there.  Flavor of the fish was incredibly mild; the batter stole some of its thunder.  

The fries were excellent - battered-style and straight cut.  I'm told the slaw and tartar were "average."  Dinner roll was hard and dry.

Total lunch bill for two: $14.64, and we were in-and-out within 35 minutes.  Totally acceptable and a good lunch, all things considered.

Middleton Sport Bowl = NEUTRAL

Food = 2.75 to 3 stars (average; not bad, not spectacular)
Service = 3.5 stars (prompt and friendly)
Value = 4 stars 
MISC = 3 stars (actually seemed to be a nice bowling alley/bar)

Summary: Not a win, nor a fail.  I'd go back for the fish at lunch, and will definitely be back to sample other foods - the sandwiches looked really good.It's not the best or most authentic, but I love it.  The service is great and combo #1 is a home run.Haiku for Average

I initially wrote my bad Haiku on the Midtown IHOP.  I'd noted how few words and sentences people use in reviews, gave mine some old Japanese flair.  Unfair.    

Midtown IHOP List:

 - Open 24 Hours.
 - Best items on the menu, breakfasts, served 24 hours/day.
 - Low to moderate prices.  
 - Three streets north of the Encanto Light Rail stop. 
 - Across the street from Fairfield Inn Midtown.  Within a mile of a Hilton, Holiday Inn, Ramada, Marriott, Hampton Inn, and Extended Stay.
 - Newly redecorated.  It may be the best IHOP within 20 miles.
 - Good place for a long discussion with a friend or informal business connection.
 - Early rock and 60's soul music in the background.
 - Decent lunch and dinner entrees.
 - If your schedule is tight or you've got a half-hour lunch, this is not the place to eat.I went here for the first time after driving by this restaurant for about a year.  The chips and salsa were great.  I ordered a cheese enchilada, taco and tostada combo.  It was very reasonably priced.  The rice and taco were very good.  The beans and enchilada were so-so.  I will return as some of the neighboring tables had some unique dishes that looked pretty good.Hot and Sour Soup. Not for the weak of heart, but phenomenal. Oh and the House Dynamite is also a great spicy dish with a touch of sweetness.

Fate is amazing, and I love that CenPho is getting cute cozy little restaurants popping up everywhere, but...the service at Fate sucks. The girls are unfriendly (not rude, but not open or approachable). The last time I went there was in the winter and they forced us to sit on the open patio. It never gets that cold in Phoenix, but it was night time and I froze and I finally was able to get the girl to close the sliding door (after asking her twice). They definitely need to learn how to be more accomodating to their guests.
Oh and forget trying to go there on First Fridays...It's MADNESS.The place is pretty good.  The staff is friendly.....the atmosphere is great......the decor is funky & cool.

But, the food was tasty but the rice was dry, cold & hard.  I would say the food is average.

That said, I would say the place is fun.  I wouldn't drive all the way downtown for it...but if I was in the area, it's a good place to stop.Average food, convenient location and decent prices.  Good place for a quick bite or a casual dinner.Well, Okay, it's hooters.  So I guess I have to review the waittresses too?  On this day, they were not bad looking, and they were dressed in skimpy shorts and tight Tee Shirts, but honestly, I don't think I'd go out with any of them, even if they begged me.

I had lunch, ordering the hot wings.  I could not decide, so I had five "hot" and five "3-mile Island" - which, I guess means they should have been hotter.  There was one mre level "Cherynobl", but I initially thought that might be too hot for me.  In hindsight, it prolly would have been closer to what I consider hot.

The hot wings were not hot.  Hardly even mild.  But they did have a reddish, hot-sauce appearing sauce on them.  The 3-Mile Island was only slightly hotter, and the red sauce slightly darker.  This was closer to what I wanted.  You get a choice of blue cheese or ranch for dipping.  If you want celery and carrots, that's extra.

I would not say this was a really good value, $15 for ten wings, a glass of iced tea and a tip.

Not much I can say about this place, I actually came for the wings and honestly, I was fairly disappointed all around.Despite all the local hype, this place is average at best. Everyone I know who has eaten there RAVES about it, but I just can't get into it. Take it with a grain of salt because I'm not like a huge BBQ buff at all, but I seriously don't think it tastes much better than ribs from say, Chili's or some chain resteraunt. BBQ sauce is BBQ sauce to me. It tastes the same as Kraft BBQ sauce from the bottle.I was sort of expecting more from this. The food is decidedly average sports bar food, not really anything special. Plus, the side dishes are weird. Mandarin Oranges and apple slices don't really belong next to a burger, in my opinion. Still, it was a good enough meal, the waitress was super friendly and I highly recommend the Michael Buble drink, just drink with caution, it's strong!My BF got us tickets with the best intentions.  He thought it would be a great excuse to doll up. BUT I think we went overboard.  When we got there it felt like were the only ones that dolled up. =(

Lots of stuck up older women. Felt like a scene from pretty woman... UGH....  I didn't think I looked like a hooker at all but when in the elevator I questioned my outfit.  *** I should have worn nylons or slacks lol*** cause obviously a peplum pencil skirt and a silk blouse made me look like a whore!!  


We spent the whole day driving so when we saw the concert.....the beautiful music got us so SLEEPY...  we ended up leaving early. =(

We promised to each other that we will come back in 15 years!!Nice location and the food was good.  Service was initially quick but quickly things went south when the restaurant filled with people.  I think we may have been forgotten when we came here but they seemed to have been short staffed.  I don't totally blame the staff, but simple requests were quickly forgotten and 20 minutes later we were making the same request again.  Perhaps they should hire more people -- otherwise id recommend this location.Slogan: "you don't need no teeth to eat our meat"...  Actually, yeah, you really do. I gotta respect honey bears for becoming somewhat of an icon in the valley, but the pulled pork leaves a little room for improvement. My opinion is that it's cooked at too high of a temp. (note to honeybear: aim for 225 degrees - get staff in earlier if necessary)  Too high temp results in not enough time in it's early cooking stages to absorb that smoke flavor, which is also evidenced by an absence of color.   Slower cook time will also take some of the bite out of the meat.  But hey, it seems to be selling, so why change?  Maybe they should change the slogan though.  It is tasty, but all of the pork sandwich's flavor comes from the sauce, which is pretty unique - give me 100 sauces and i guarantee i can pick out honeybears.Decent zoo, but not what you'd expect in a city this size.  Agree with previous comments that more indoor attractions would be desirable in this baking climate.  Only tip is to get there early!I had an OK time at the Phoenix Zoo today. My biggest complaint is not necessarily the zoos fault.... but it sucks that its so warm/hot here that all of the animals sleep, and/or are inactive during the day, so it's rather boring to see exhibit after exhibit of sleeping non active animals. 

The grounds are beautiful. The "add-ons" are pretty reasonable price wise. Zip lining is $10, camel ride is $5 per person, and the paddle boats are $10 for 20 minutes. All in all pretty fair. 

I can't say I left with a really "favorite" attraction...which is sad. Usually I do. 

Hotdogs are $6. Not much else to eat (that I saw).We decided to eat here while at the Moon festival Sat night. I was a little embarrassed that we had a stroller with us but they didn't bat an eye. They showed us where to put it and we were good to go. My husband and I each had a Tsing Tao (I'm sure I mispelled that), and split an order of crab rangoon, sweet and sour chicken and rice noodles with beef. Everything was decent although not enough to distinguish itself from other Chinese restaurants. Service was great and prices were extremely reasonable. My fave was the rice noodles with beef because it had lots of onions, sprouts and other veggies in it. A little salty for my liking but I liked it nonetheless. I am indifferent if I were to go back. Apparently you can find certificates on Restaurant.com which is cool, too. They also bring you soft, Almond cookies with the bill which is always a nice treat!AJs is an incredibly beautiful store, so much so that to me it's like a dream:  imagine a museum of all kinds of delicious food, but it's food that we can eat.  The problem I have with this place is the cost.    This is not a competitor of Frys or Safeway. AJs is for the well-to-do, the well-heeled (which I'm definitely not) and wannabes.  I only come here  for the white chocolate rum marble cake - everyone that has this cake, loves it.  I've heard "this is the best cake I've ever eaten" from everyone that tastes it.  We only found this by accident.  We needed a cake and didn't want to pay upwards of $30.00.  We saw on AJs website that they reduce the cost of one cake each month from $25 to $20.  This cake happened to be the one that was on sale, so that's what we ended up with.  We couldn't believe how good it was.  Much better than any cake we've ever bought elsewhere and paid considerably more for (Does anyone besides me belive that TammieCoe is completely overpriced?).  Every time we need cake (because who has time anymore to bake a cake, wait for it to cool, make frosting, and then try to get it to look good), this is the one we get.  Don't wait until the last minute - order in advance.  They don't have every cake listed on their website in stock.There is a lot of hype for this pretty average sandwich joint. My co-workers and I heard about this place through a listing of 20 great American Sandwich shops and it apparently even had an Oprah mention. After seeing these glowing reviews here as well I was pretty much certain that I would be let down in some way, but its hard to even imagine the reason for the hype this place achieved.

It is an extremely tiny shop stuck at the end of the strip mall with central music. It's so tiny I've parked in front of it before and haven't even noticed it. The inside looks to have been renovated circa 1982 with faux wood paneling and shelving, and vintage boar's head advertisements that have been left to rot. The menu spread out across the entire wall on a confusing mix of chalk boards and computer print outs. The eating space is an extremely claustrophobic setup of folding tables and chairs stuck between the deli counter and the half-assed market shelves that sported international items that were mostly covered with a thick layer of dust.

The actual sandwiches, solid quality deli stuff using primarily boar's head meats and cheeses. That's it? Why would you fall in love with this place? I went with five other guys who ordered a mix of their signature sandwiches (Doughboy, Bizmark, Manhattan), and all agreed you can get a similar sandwich at grocery stores and preferred even the likes of Sack's to this place. There is just nothing inventive about the sandwiches or anything that stands out here other then the friendly Mom and Pop ownership and sweet vintage sign.Fresh salad buffet, with soups, pasta, breads and desserts.

The salads ingredients are always fresh and tasty with a lot of great varieties.  The soups can be hit or miss, however the chili is consistently good.  Freshly baked breads and focaccia complement your meal.  Round out your meal with soft serve ice cream, a variety of baked goods or sugar free desserts.

I asked the server what he would recommend to me and he said the Pad Thai with chicken. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was delicious. The server was very friendly and helpful.

We came back a few days ago at about 430 pm and I was not as impressed. I ordered the Pad Thai again, but I was not happy with the server we had. She took forever to get our drinks and was not the friendliest. She also took my husbands soda while we were eating to refill it and took forever to bring it back. It was not even empty yet. I like the Pad Thai, but there is nothing else very appetizing on the menu for me. I would come back for the Pad Thai.I love, love, love ramen. I had it in San Francisco, so that's my gold standard. I went to the Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe and had the spicy Szechuan ramen. The broth was fantastic. However, the noodles did not seem like genuine ramen. They had the taste and texture of Italian vermicelli. My inner food snob was all like "Sacre bleu! Zis eez sacrilege!" but my inner glutton helped me to get over it and enjoy the delicious spicy soup.I have been coming here for years.  Love the mellow vibe of sitting in the bar, sports is on super low volume and nice place to just hang out and relax with a quiet conversation.  Food is pretty good, won't knock your socks off or anything, but okay.  Lately, I think they have reduced their portion size and raised their prices, although I can't confirm that it just seems that is what they are doing.  Which is fine, not trying to pig out or anything, but then again, most people like a great bargain (and perhaps some leftovers for street tacos in the morning - if you are like me anyway).  

I did want to add something.  I think I have talked about this before, but not sure.  Their cheese queso dip is the BEST IN THE VALLEY and you WILL NOT BEAT IT.  Recently, they started servicing sonoran hot dogs (awwww yeaaah, you know that's Attorney Steve's weak spot).  But anyhow, instead of ordering the hot dog their way, order it PLAIN with a bowl of the queso cheese sauce.  Then, when your dog comes, dip it into the cheese sauce with each bite.  If that is not the best thing you have ever had, respond to me on yelp telling me ATTORNEY STEVE YOU ARE A TOTAL MORON!!  I will deal with it if you do.  But yeah, that is DA BOMB sonoran dog.  

That being said, I always speak my mind.  The hot dog bun itself is a bit dry.  I really think they should serve those wrapped in aluminum to keep the bun soft and fresh. Also, ARE YOU KIDDING ME $9.99 FOR THE DOG ARE YTOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?  

Anyway, we always go back, but based on their pricing schemes we are not regulars.  Still a great place to drop in, but that's a once every other month deal for me.   Keep in mind, if you have business clients, it is still a good place to take them.  Easy parking, good service, etc.  

Have fun, and find your sizzle!

Attorney Steve, the business and real estate lawyer.
http://www.attorneysteve.netThis place was ok.  It was really in the  middle for me.  The space is pretty cool if you like dark, cave like spaces.  I ate downstairs which was a really cool space for a bar and would be a great place to gather friends for happy hour.  The food was mediocre in my opinion.  I had a dish that was "smoked" and  the smoke flavor really overpowered the dish.  It was almost to the point where I couldn't figure out if it was meant to taste that way or if maybe it was burnt.

In any rate, I probably would list this on my places in the valley to return to.This was my first time here. We sat in the bar and caught the tail end of happy hour. 
Apparently that have complementary hors d'oeuvres, although I did not have any. 
We had a few cocktails and ordered some Salmon and Yellow tail sashimi and nigri. I love good salmon and I must say their salmon is pretty good. The Yellow tail sashimi was cut too thick for my liking. 
My biggest complaint was the smell of the restaurant. It smelled like a mix of disinfectant and cheap cologne. It was really strong and made me a little sick to my stomach...It was that time of year again, and I have to say that I'm still somewhat unimpressed. This place has such great potential, but its face just seems to keep writing a check that your stomach can't check. 

The devil is in the details, and for some reason, the details all fall short here. Its not that the food is bad...its quite good, actually. But for the price you pay, it should be perfect, not "quite good". Specifically, every bit of cooked meat that was offered was over-cooked and dry. Homemade chicken sausage looked delicious, but was nearly flavorless and seriously, I think I could get a more moist piece of chicken cooking it in the microwave. The fresh grill was lamb, which I love. Again, very very dry. That just sucks.

And again, as with my last review from a year ago, if I'm spending the extra money on an entree, don't then give me an item on my plate that is readily available on the buffet that is included in the price. That makes me feel ripped off, and that your chefs are just plain lazy.

So, for not fixing anything in the last year, I'm demoting this place by a star. I did, however like the new buffet and menu items. And, as always, the staff was friendly and attentive, professional and unobtrusive. Keep that up, but fix the stupid shit please! See you in a year.Whoops...left this in drafts for almost 2 weeks.  Ok, so now it's been 2 weeks since my first meal at Havana Cafe.  Haven't had Cuban food since last Miami visit in '05.  The black bean fritters were delish!!!  I had the Ensalada Savilla...YUM.  I did steal some of my dad's beans and rice, which were good.  My daughter had tamales, which she loved, but they were chicken so I didn't try those.  My sangria was quite nice too.  Probably not my favorite restaurant, but it was a nice change of pace and tasty!Doctors are great but the wait is loooooong...Pros: It's a dive bar and drinks are inexpensive. 

Cons: Five dollars worth of jukebox money came to no fruition in 2+ hours and a far-from-pleasant bartender. 

Summary: It's a cool joint, but be wary of the jukebox and don't expect any niceties depending on the bartender.Tasty lunch specials at a great price of $7.95.  I chose the Lahna chicken which came with wonton soup starter (lots of green onions - yum), spring roll, fried wonton + sauce, Thai slaw, chicken with dark sauce.  Pretty good but I'd like to go back and try a more standard Thai dish with more cooked veggies.

Note: I didn't taste the saltiness that others complained about.Upon walking into Office Max I felt I was entering a deserted business. I mean seriously, I saw no one.. And I mean no one.. For a good 15 minutes! I wandered the aisles in need of a rubber stamp pad to fit my wedding monogram .. Up and down the aisles.. Again. Finally!! Yay! There's another human life amongst me..& he took me to my stamp area. Check out was odd.. The girl was umboxing supplies on the check out area..& her manager acted like I just may be bothering their task for wanting to pay... Ok.. Get me outta here..Stopped here for a blizzard since I had a $5 gift card.  My daughter saw that they had a $5 lunch special and decided to get that instead.  It came with a medium drink, 3 chicken strips, medium fries, and a small sundae.  I thought it was a great deal!  And I "think" the chicken is actually real and not like the "Golden Arches" nuggets that are factory made.  

The location was clean inside and the staff was mostly young, high school age kids but very friendly.Five stars for the entertainment, 4 for the ambiance (it's a dive bar that just won't quit - from NASCAR posters on one wall, to the pin up poster above the urinal, to the cliche beer posters near the bar, this place does it up right!) and far fewer stars for the pricing, the staff, and the crowd.  Who knew Phoenix had so many ugly people?  I guess I don't get to Wal-Mart often enough to remember.  These are real folk, though.  Salt of the earth and all that.  

The prices - I must relate this story.  I walked up to the bar, saw someone with a Corona bottle, and immediately thought "I'll do that."  The straight-up hot bartender handed me the beer and said "4.25."   Ok, WHAT.  I was flabbergasted.  Never in my life have I paid so much for Corona.  This is a major dive bar FAIL right here.  Later, once the Corona was empty, we talked my friend's (female ) co-worker to get us drinks, and the other (male) bartender made us stiff drinks for a claimed price of 3.25.  There we go, that's a whole lot more like it.  Later still, I realized I had walked right past the drink specials painted on a window by the front door.  Hah, oops.  Domestic only though, what's up with that??  Anyway decent cover band for 2 bucks to get in the door, fun crowd despite the low number of hot women, and a fairly cheap evening, once you figure out the drink specials.  This place is an experience.  Plus, it's like four miles from my house.  AWESOME.  I'm trying to imagine myself biking home from here.  Or better still, chaining my bike up by the front door next to all the choppers upon arrival.  HA.  I may never be back, but I'll remember this place for years.Not a huge fan of Baskin-Robbins.....but they do have a decent deals during the week but only during certain hours. The place is nothing special and the seating area along with the tables are always in disarray. I hear this establishment has been around for many years but this one is very small....outdated....and a bit messy. Some renovations might improve it....but for the most part I would go elsewhere for Ice Cream. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!!Good service bbq was tastee. Overall happy!It's a whopper, but they definitely live up to their reputation as America's friendliest airport.  Even the security checkers were kind and conversationalists.  Make sure you budget plenty of extra time, especially if you're renting a car on location.  The rental car area is WAY off site.  The good news is that there's a line of three shuttles rolling by, almost as if they are on a continuous conveyor belt.  Terminal C's TCBY was a good surprise, but if you can swing the time, grab some Cold Stone Creamery before going through security.changed planes here on my way home from New Orleans. This airport was clean and seemed new. There was a Nathan's in my terminal so I got a delicious wiener before boarding. A pretty decent airport, much better than either Denver, Saint Louis or Philadelphia!Eh I have mixed feelings about this place. It is a really big airport so takes awhile to get around. The food options get it done but much of them are outside security so if you have time look around those first. The lines here can be bad so plan ahead. I will say I was able to check a bag and get to my gate 30 minutes before takeoff thanks to having access to the flyby security line. The rental car buses come kinda frequently but plan on 20 mins to/from get to the rental car facility from the airport.Ok airport. My flight was on time this timeFree wifi, a decide layout, and smooth security lines.  Yup, there are a few positives worth highlighting at Sky Harbor.  They also had rental car locations organized fairly well with easy access shuttles to get you there.  On the flip side, I wasn't really impressed with the food offerings.  I'm not overly picky, but if the airport food isn't any better than the in flight food, then you might have a problem.  However, overall more pros than cons.OK, I am getting tired of catching the new employees overcharging me. Every time we go there there seems to be a new wave of newbies. We go there enough and always get the same thing so I know exactly how much it is supposed to cost. The last two times there I had to have a manager (also new) cancel and re-ring my purchase. The employees always want to debate with me so I just ask for the manager to double check the total. So far I am batting 1000. Today the guy had a bit of an attitude when I busted him. I always give them my loyalty card which shows them that we have been there well over 300 times. You would think that they would train their employees to pay attention to the customer visit count, especially with super-regular customers. We were wondering how much extra money they make $2 at a time with travelers that don't know any better. I have heard that this is a training location...trial by fire I guess in this always busy shop... but then someone else said it is not. I am still suspicious of all the new employees every couple weeks.

The cookies and sandwiches are still awesome. The sandwiches may actually be the best of all the locations I go to, probably because they do so much business here that everything is always super fresh. It is hard to give the cookies less than 3 stars but if this problem persists I will be downgrading this location again.A veg burrito is not where it is at.

On my second trip I went for the vegetarian burrito $3.75 again it came with a small tray of chips and a lettuce garnish. The wait was a bit long this time. I felt the tortilla was far too large for this burrito creating large amounts of extra tortilla, and it did not seem that soft to me.  The filling of beans, lettuce , a few veggies and guacamole was not well distributed and lacked inspiration.

The hot sauce is still good but  I am in no rush to head back here.The beef soft tacos were truly outstanding.  I should have just quit right there, because I was really disappointed by the enchilada (bland sauce from a can, hardly any cheese) and tamale (dried out and flavorless).  Beans and rice were just there, nothing special.Just got back from Los Taquitos. Picked up the 3 tacos combo. I got two fish and one shrimp with rice and beans for $6.75 plus tax and I also got a horchata. There are a couple thing I want to address. First off, the horchata was overwhelmingly sweet and grainy and this is because it is sitting in a container with spout on the bottom, so all the sugar and everything settles there and gets poured into the drink. It tasted almost like bubble gum. Easy solution, get a circulating fountain like most mexican restaurants have or even a container and ladle it out so it can be stirred, like I had in Mexico.
Ok Food, The tacos I had were really good, I just hate that they are only 3 bites each, I could eat like 10 and I'm a small girl. The street tacos in Mexico are bigger for sure. The shrimp was so tiny, like the smallest salad shrimp and there was 3 on my taco, so that just shows how small they are. The fish is good, but it is chopped up so it looks like chicken and kinda tastes like chicken and doesnt have much flavor on its own. It comes with just lettuce and pico which is fine, I would have preferred cabbage like in Mexico. I was offered one of each sauce. A spicy chipotle and a really spicy green. Both are good, the green a lil better. Rice and beans are good, nothing spectacular. I was a lil disappointed that i didn't get lime and napkins and a fork. I could have easily grabbed it myself but I was in a hurry.
I should also mention that the first time I went, my partner did not like the bombero burrito at all because it was drenched in the chipotle sauce, so if yo don't like chipotle I wouldn't recommend it.
As for the place itself, it has a good ambience. The counter girl is friendly. The mural on the wall is pretty badass. No table service so expect to wait for a number to be called.
Overall it's not a bad spot, probably the only lil mexican taco shop in Tuke. Please take my suggestions about the horchata and putting napkins, silverware and limes in the to go orders and consider upping the size of your tacos, I need more than 3 bites each!Came here for a conference with the spousal unit.  I was expecting great things as the resort was advertised as "4 diamond".  Well, on the pro side, the room is huge.  There is a living room/ conference room--yes we have a huge conference table big enough for 8 of our friends to join us for a business meeting if we are suddenly overcome with an urge to throw one.  There is a nice seating area--I assume the couch will open up to a bed--and a sink and teeny fridge, which is full of soda, beer, water, rock star beverages and candy; for which they will charge you a pretty penny.  A sink and toilet is located down a small hallway.  Then there are double doors and a decent size room with a large closet and nice sized bathroom.

However, no lotion, no shower caps no sewing kits:  nothing except 3 teensy bottles of shampoo, etc.  There is a  magnifying mirror, but it's not lighted........4 diamonds?

More cons:

The old-fashioned tv's have already been mentioned in several reviews; yup, not updated yet.

No desk, no charging station for guests' numerous electronic devices, scratchy towels, too soft pillows and NO robes or slippers--the worst for me as I purposely packed neither.  

Pros:  the bed is really comfortable, the two air conditioning thermostats work quickly and efficiently, the windows open and there is a door to a small, oddly shaped patio (which has no chairs).

This is not a terrible hotel.  It is very large, the rooms are decent and the parking in the Sedona rooms is very convenient.  I can't comment on the gym as I didn't feel like paying an extra $15 per visit and so drove myself to the very close by LA Fitness instead. 

What I find very annoying is the 4 diamond rating they tout all over the place.  

Bottom line:  This hotel simply does not have the amenities a genuine 4 diamond hotel should have.Above average. The Korma and Vindaloo were tasty. We ordered spicy, and boy, it was. Whew. Definately one of the better Indian places in the East Valley. Oh, the staff was friendly but slow.The buffet was pretty good, nice selection, though the flavors were a bit understated. I can understand, for a buffet needs to have wide appeal. I just think if people are going to an Indian restaurant they should have a good general idea what they are in for. As such, I would have preferred the food have a bit more of a kick. 

Service was decent, casual but friendly. Clean, well set table and and nice ambiance. Maybe a good place to take someone experiencing Indian or the first time, but if you are looking for spice like I was, you might be disappointed.This place is 3 1/2 stars... or their overall rating, so far. I had the shrimp/pasta special. It tasted like the shrimp had been frozen and then overcooked; giving it that rubbery texture. The sauce was pretty good. For $25, I would have expected more than four pieces of shrimp and a handful of pasta.Great food, good prices, fun atmosphere!  It does get crowded so expect a little wait.A good friend of mine knows Big Al personally and recommended I come here to purchase a truck, so I did. I looked at the website and found exactly what I wanted and was happy to find it still available when I showed up. 

We were helped by a salesman named Robbie and we were very pleased with everything he did for us, he was upfront and honest about everything (as far as I know), patient and fair. I would highly recommend working with him and I believe he will treat you as well as he did me. Robbie is a 5 star asset to this company and I couldn't recommend him highly enough, seriously find him specifically if you come here and tell him I sent you. 

Here's where the 5 star rating turns into a 3 star rating (I would have made it 2.5 if I had that option). My advice, once you find the vehicle you like and have made a deal that is a win-win, I would highly recommend steering clear of JR in the finance department. I would go so far to say to wait for the next available finance person. We came in with Capital One financing already secured and gave them the opportunity to compete for the loan, knowing that the dealership would benefit and so would we if they could beat the deal we had. 

He was able to find me 5.75% (we had 6.44%) but told me he "pulled a favor" and I had to buy an extended warranty to get that rate. I had explained to him multiple times that I was not interested in an extended warranty because the vehicle only has 1,900 miles and it has a factory warranty. 

He threw a fit when I wasn't interested in his "add-on's". I explained to him thoroughly and repeatedly that I only drive 5-6,000 miles per year and buying an extended warranty didn't make any sense to us, nor did a maintenance package.  

He was really irritated with my rejection of his products and proceeded to treat me poorly moving forward, he couldn't get me out of his office fast enough and even turned down the maintenance records I had on our trade in vehicle out of spite. 

If he would have taken even a minute to understand my needs, he too would realize that each of his products would cost me twice as much in the long run. Does this guy think that I base financial decisions on what's best for him or what's best for my family?

If it wasn't for this small being this would have been a 5 star review and I would be currently stopping traffic to refer business to Big Al. Instead I give it a lowly 3 stars and might send business, might not. 

JR, you are the last person a car buyer will speak to and will deal with and the final impression of the company you work for. When you behave with teenage angst, you are not an asset to your company, you are a liability. I am an enormous referral source, I send a lot of business (A LOT) to people who treat me well and you did not treat me or my wife respectfully. This is a service industry and your service was underwhelming and anyone who reads this post can do much better.I took my miniature Dachshund, Spottie, who is ten years old, for a check-up. I had the United Pet Care policy for him and as a result it was not as expensive. He got his distemper vaccine, and a overall check-up. I love the diagnostics this clinic gives. They give you a printout and very detailed explanation of each "issue" your little critter has. They give you options and are less expensive than other veterinarians in the Mesa area. I found it funny that my little dog is somewhat snappy and he hated the doctor but loved the vet techs.I've always been leery of Old Chicago because it's a chain, but we stopped in one evening while waiting for Best Buy to finish tinting the windows on my fiance's car. We just had a few beers and spinach artichoke dip, but I was pleasantly surprised. They had a pretty decent beer selection. The dip was really heavy on the cream cheese, but definitely not the worst I've had (I'm looking at you, Ruby Tuesdays...). The service was fantastic, though. Our server (Jesus, according to our receipt) was incredibly nice and attentive without being pushy or obnoxious. All in all, great service and decent food.Lakeside Restaurant & Cantina - A Reasonably Priced Restaurant Overlooking Canyon Lake

One recent Wednesday, we took the noon Scenic Nature Tour on the Dolly Steamboat on Canyon Lake.  After viewing the Dolly Steamboat Website, we were under the impression that sandwiches or a box lunch would be available on the afternoon tours.  We were wrong.  Therefore, by the end of the 90-minute boat ride, we were hungry.  There were no other restaurants within a couple of miles of the boat, so we decided to eat at Lakeside Restaurant & Cantina, right next door. The exterior of the restaurant looked very appealing. We knew that it had a picturesque view of Canyon Lake.  

We were, therefore, a little surprised when we entered the restaurant that the décor was so dated.   Let me just say that the interior does not compete with the view of Canyon Lake.    If it were not such a hot day in June with temperatures in the 108-degree range, we would have dined outside on the patio.  The Dolly was not going out for another tour that afternoon, so she stayed docked while we ate our lunch.  

We were greeted as we entered the restaurant and told to sit wherever we wanted.  We chose a table near a window.  Some diners who we recognized from the boat tour were already seated and drinking tropical drinks.  If you just want a drink, they have a fully stocked bar.  Our very pleasant server brought over menus and took our beverage orders. She was very helpful and answered our questions about menu choices.   We were tempted to order the Canyon Mudslide or the Capsized Cactus Creation but we had more sightseeing to do plus a long ride home so we stayed with water.    

There were more than 17 choices on the Lunch Menu and the Special of the Day for Wednesday was Swiss Mushroom Burger.  I wished that we had dined on a Saturday because a Reuben Sandwich was the Special that day.  Although I was leaning toward the Philly Cheese Steak, $7.89, I finally settled on the Greek Gyro, $7.49 and my included side was fries.  The rest of my party ordered the Special of the Day and chose various sides.  Our orders took quite awhile to arrive.   Maybe it just seemed that way because we were so hungry.  On the other hand, maybe it was just that everyone from the boat tour arrived around the same time.  My Gyro was good and the others enjoyed their burgers. If you like burgers, there are seven choices not including the Grilled Chicken Burger which will cost you $1 more if you substitute it for the beef.  The Chef Specialties were Cheese Steak and BBQ Pork Ribs.  Soups/Chili, Salads and Seafood dishes round out the Lunch menu.  

The many (15) Appetizers are all the usual ones plus a few unusual ones.  Prices ranged from a half portion of Buffalo wings, $3.29 up to $8.79 for Nachos Grande.  Many were in the mid range of $14- $16 such as Buffalo Shrimp, Beer Batter Shrimp, Mozzarella or Clam Sticks.  Dinner Entrees range from $12.49 for a Seafood Platter, Fillet of Lemon Tilapia or Blackened Cajun Catfish up to $16.99 for Rib Eye and $20.99, Surf & Turf.  Dinner Entrees come with two sides.   Dine on Fridays for the All-You-Can-Eat Fish Fry.  

Although we were tempted by the variety of soft ice cream choices, we decided to wait until we visited Tortilla Flats and have dessert there.  The restrooms for the restaurant are public ones used also by patrons of the Dolly Steamboat.  They were a little messy late in the afternoon but I have been in worse ones.  The restaurant does offer free Wi-Fi.The #24 General Tso's chicken, was really good. delivery service was a little slow but the food was pretty good.I've been here twice in the last month for Dim Sum.  Overall it's an ok place.  Their service suck.  Both times, we had to wait more than 5 mins before someone came over to get our drink order.4 for atmosphere, 3 for food and service

I found this place on Yelp for dinner last night and my friend and I hung out in our care a few minutes before they opened at 5pm. We were quickly seated and we took a look at the HH menu and figured out what we wanted. We shared an order of the shrimp tempura, and I had a California roll and spicy tuna roll and my friend had a Vegas roll and rainbow roll. Our server was very nice, but the time between his stops at our table and how the food came out was really long. It took probably 10 minutes for our appetizer to come out, and then from the first sushi roll coming out, it probably took another 10 minutes to get all 4 of our rolls on the table. They weren't overly busy, but it looked like food was coming out to different tables at different times which seemed strange. My rolls were okay - nothing mind blowing. While I waited a lot, I was fascinated by a little private room they have in the back which was super cute and chic. The restaurant has a very NY vibe to it. I'll probably returnwhere else do you go for home things. I know where else...I'm just saying.... This place does give a military discount tho & its much appreciated!This Cheesecake Factory is pretty good. The service was amazing, the manager even came over at one point and told us not to worry our food was on its way (while my boyfriend and I didn't even think it had been a long time.)

The food was just okay. We got calamari as an appetizer, it was good, but just a little to chewy. My pasta was bland..and for $16 dollars I've had way better pasta. My boyfriend got a hamburger and he asked for it to be cooked medium rare and it came out well done. While this dinner experience was just meh I've had a lot better food from here..so all hope isn't lost! 

Then we both got a piece of cheesecake which was super scrumptious so at least there was that! 

If anything we'll probably give this place another try for lunch at some point.Need a good dusting!  All the passages where the kids play are covered with dust!!
Will not take my kid there again.For a steakhouse, the steak was just okay, i ordered medium rare and portions of the steak were either medium or just rare.. The service was great and the sides were perfect, especially the twice baked potato. Just really wish the steak were better.Let me ask you this, have you ever had breakfast, lunch and dinner at the same restaurant in the same day?

Usually I stray away from reviews of places we're all familiar with, but today I thought I would give the Sonic some l-o-v-e.  Especially since, I ate at the same Sonic three (tres, 3, iii) times today.

For breakfast I got the Bistro Sandwich with Bacon, Egg and Cheese. I usually toss one of the buns and have it open faced. I don't want to appear gluttonous. :P

For lunch, a Wacky Pack with a hamburger, tots and a small iced tea. The prize was a plastic bug catcher.

For dinner, I had a hot fudge sundae and tots.

Hey, I've gotta go, I hear they have .99 root beer floats till midnight.My hubby and I were out driving around running errands from Tempe to Mesa to Gilbert and with the heat were just downright delirious and in a huge need for a cold adult beverage.  We saw the sign for Crabby Don's, thought it was funny and decided to give it a try.  At 11:30 a.m. on a Monday it was pretty slow, but the bartender was staying busy multi-tasking.  Looked like she was setting up glasses for both bars and attending to a couple of patrons who were sitting at the bar.  She still found time to be friendly and helpful with us and we did not feel neglected at all.  

We were thrilled to find $2 Rolling Rocks and then when I asked about food, I noticed they had Breckenridge Brewing SummerBright Ale on tap.  (I'm easily distracted when it comes to beer).  It's not often I see a BB beer here in this area, so we gave that a try.  Not too shabby.  Definitely a passable summer lager.  We didn't want a full meal so shared the sliders.  Very simple cheeseburger sliders, but they had a good grilled flavor and the buns had been grilled too which is a simple touch that I like a lot.  I also like that they give you 4 instead of 3, like a lot of places do.   4 is perfect for sharing with the one you love, or the one you want to love for that night.

Overall it was a good dark cool divey place for a pit stop with a good drink selection.  The food prices aren't too bad either and it's the typical bar food menu.  I'm probably too old and square to enjoy the bands, etc. they get in there, but I would definitely stop in again if I'm out in the area.I have decided that my experiences in these type of hyper-large warehouse stores has a lot more to do with the staffer than the company. Its about a 50/50 shot that I will encounter a helpful, intelligent human while searching for my newest shiny electronic gadget.

Last week I managed to encounter a friendly, passionate, thoughtful employee at this Best Buy that actually exceeded my dimmed expectations. He helped me pick out a Samsung P2 MP3 Player (that I absolutely love) and a bluetooth speaker that it plays through sans cords...

We even debated the benefits of subscription music vs. buy-each-song style services. *We both agreed that subscription services make much more sense than trying to collect every song $1 at a time... (checkout rhapsody and napster which let you download unlimited songs to your MP3 player for $15mo.)

Anyway, I have a little more respect for Best Buy after this experience (they manage to accidentally hire a few good ones).My husbands boss was in town and wanted to take some of his employees out to a nice swanky dinner. he made a reservation for 6:30 pm on a Friday night. we get there and our table is ready to go! Our server Javier was very polite, I would say he could have been more attentive but they were busy and it was a large place. 
Any way, I ordered a Mojito, it was just ok. You would think for the price it would have been the best Mojito I have ever tasted. There was to much Mint and not enough anything else. It looked as though a forest was growing out of my glass. I love Mojitos and this one was by far the worst I had ever had. no appetizer because we are on a time constraint we have tickets to a show right after dinner so we hop right into ordering the main course. I ordered the Prime Ribeye, for 43.00 you would think it would be all meat right?!? nope not so much, a good 2 inches of my ribeye was pure solid fat, (not the edible kind) I was pretty upset and you would also think that for the price it would come with a side.. yep think again. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes (9.00) for a quarter of a cup of potatoes. I have to admit they were DELICIOUS! but not $9.00 for a quarter of a cup delicious. My husband ordered the Scallops. and thats just what he got, 5 scallops on a huge plate that had so much paprika on them they were red.  I myself never understand spending so much money on so little food but hey if that's what you enjoy doing where you have to hit up the drive thru on the way home because your still hungry I recommend this place.Mixed feelings. Ran into a former management type on a cruise ship and he told me when in Scottsdale I needed to go to this barber shop to get a great haircut. I probably wouldn't have but he followed up with a gift card. I called him to thank him and he told me to walk in and I would be taken care of. I did and explained my gift card and showed the Mario's business card to David. I thought I was getting the $45 service since I explained that was what Mario told me he gave me.  The half hour was great: excellent haircut, a shave I didn't need but which impressed the wife, shoe shine, offer for a shampoo which I declined three hours after I washed my hair. I also got a massage of sorts which I didn't expect. I also didn't expect a $70 charge less the $45 gift card. I paid the balance plus the $20 tip I was intending to give. It was a great experience but I didn't plan to spend that much. At the time I was thinking $45 every time I am in Scottsdale isn't that much. Afterward I was thinking I might not come back. Obviously I had a communication problem. I don't want to be put in a position of having a significantly higher bill when I expected  to pay a different price.  But the service was great if there had been better communication.Nice atmosphere.  service was great.  food was just ok.  ordered oysters, tuna ahi, filet, and rib eye for two.  the rib eye came out already cut up.  didn't like this as I like to cut into my own steak!  a little bit too much salt on everything for our taste.Wednesday, Girls' day for 4 (two rooms)

Reservations-Making reservations = not seamless, took two phone calls and a facebook post to recover the summer deal on the rooms.

Check-in...this hotel was desolate!  The pools, restaurants, halls, grounds were an expected AZ summertime wasteland.  Yet they stuck us with two rooms with a less-desirable view.  What?  You can't spare a golf course view or an upgrade during your 'off' season?  All four of our room keys failed, for two different doors, nothing like having to phone down and then WAIT!!!

Concierge - left us messages to come see her for a special Starwood gift.  It was an apple shaped cookbook of apple recipes...ummm, I appreciate the thought, but what the heck does this have to do with AZ, Spa retreat, or luxury resort???  She also had unrelenting eye contact.  Very odd experience.

Room - nice and neat.  Upon one use of toilet (#1 just so you know!), the toilet overflowed, which then had us calling for a handy-man and again another WAIT!!! 

Spa - 
+ 30% off services for Phoenix residents on Wednesday!
+ massage was awesome!!!!
- small, scratchy spa towels
- showers aren't the mulit-flow (rainforest) showers like most spas (disappointed with that)
- hot tub right next to the restrooms, ewww!
- It took FOREVER for the receptionist to charge 4 massages to one room number...again, another WAIT!!!  

Pools...
Adult Pool
- Cabana reserved...NO other Cabana's reserved and they gave us the worst one, furthest form the pool.  What????  We moved, of course, but these are LOW rent Cabana's...I know this isn't Vegas, but 4 chairs, a table, a fan, and some iced water for $80??  
- Bird POOP everywhere...on the chairs, on the umbrella's, on our clothes...ewwwwh!
- Got 2 Midori margarita's in and they ran out of Midori.  WHAT kind of place is this???  
+ Coco, the pool guy was awesome!!  Very friendly, searched the grounds to get us another bottle of Midori, and took off the Cabana charge for our trouble.  That is good service!!  We love Coco!!

Kids Pool
+ The good thing was that there were hardly any kids so we could do the slides and lazy river with no trouble.  Don't get me wrong, I like kids, I have 2, but not when it is a girls' day.
+ Slide was fun.
- Tons of teens working their summer job...more interested in chatting it up with co-workers or totally uninterested/bored with the whole thing.

Housekeeping...ignored the do not disturb and busted in on us around 9ish then argued with us about it.  So much for sleeping in!

If this is how it is during the 'off' season, what is it like when this place is hoppin'?  

It was OK, but did not live up to the hype of a Westin or Scottsdale resort.Yes, i know that the Y is a family-oriented establishment. But the massive number of children just milling about in the hallways is a bit more than frustrating. There is a lounge area that should be utilized by people socializing before/after classes, but for some reason, the doorways of the studios and the hallways are just SO MUCH MORE FUN to stand in! I would like to get to and from the locker room and exercise room without having to excuse myself as I navigate through the minefield of casual chatterboxes and feel like I'm interrupting THEM.

The equipment is fairly up-to-date and well-maintained. I like that there are more than enough treadmills, elliptical machines and recumbent bikes that no time limit is imposed upon users.
I've only taken one class so far, but the instructor was SO NICE and understanding and clear on her instructions (it was a yoga-based class, and i am NOT a yoga master by any stretch) that I'll definitely be back. I'd also like to take Zumba at this location; it looks to be acceptable for all fitness levels, but it's also always full.A fast food place, but of all the fast Japanese food places I've been to [and I've tried most of them], I would rate this one highest.  3 stars is the highest I'd rate a fast food joint.  If you get the chicken, I would recommend getting the all white meat rice bowl.  I prefer their beef bowls.  Their sushi rolls are sub-par, and since they are pre-made, I wouldn't recommend them.  Their wraps are good as well.It's a Dollar Tree, so I really didn't have high expectations going in, and I'm wasn't overly disappointed.  It's loosely organized, mostly stocked, and staff are rare except to check out.  Not a big selection of items, but again it's a Dollar Store, not Target or Walgreens.  I don't typically shop here, and just went in with my wife looking for a particular item (large nail clippers), which they didn't have in stock at the time.  I do appreciate that they actually stick to the $1 price tag, versus other "dollar" stores that do not.I needed a quick lunch today after doing some errands during lunch today. I ordered the #5 which is the bacon cheeseburger, fries and a drink for $6.58. The burger tasted good but is not quite on par to a Smashburger or Culvers. The fries were average, nothing special. I did like that the size of the drink was rather large, I'm too lazy to constantly get up and refill those puny small drink cups that you normally get with the combo. I will definitely return to Whataburger when in the area and in need of a reasonably priced meal.Went to Ajo Al's because my parents love the place (they eat anything). We walked in and waited for someone to seat us and waited and waited and waited. A full 5 minutes later, no lie - it was 5 minutes, someone did finally come to us to ask if we were helped. We got to our table, we received 2 bowls of chips, all chips were tiny tiny, ya know the chips at the bottom of the bag. Looked like they didn't want to cook fresh chips so they served the crumbs that they had. Nevertheless, chips are chips so we still ate them. I ordered the cheese conqueso dip and when the server delivered it was very thin, almost a liquid consistency. I didn't want to say anything but my mom did and the waiter brought us shredded cheese that we added to the conqueso and made it right, ourselves (aren't we paying someone to do this for us?)

Anyway, besides everything that happened BEFORE getting our lunch, lunch was fabulous. Like always, their food is great. Maybe an off night? 

I would have rated it more but they need to work on a few things!

#1 customer service! especially in a society that is going through a recession.Riazzis Italian Garden in Tempe is a place I've always thought about going to. Well, I finally made it the other day. I took my roommate with me, so I didn't look like a goober sitting in a booth by myself. We walked in as the Hostess was finishing a reservation over the phone, and we were greeted when she finished. She gave us the option of booth, or table.  I went with booth (I didn't want to sit at a table in the middle of an empty room). The hostess took us to our booth, set our menus down, said the server would be here in a minute, and took off.  Not to friendly, but she did her part. 
As we looked over our menu a staff member brought us some bread, and water. Seconds after, our server came to our table and introduced herself, asking if we wanted anything else to drink besides water. Both my roommate and I ordered a Peroni, which is an Italian beer.  I also asked for an order of calamari which she stated was "very good." The server brought us our drinks followed by the calamari. She came back a minute later and asked if we were ready to order, or if we needed more time to look over the menu. Both my roommate and I were ready; so we placed our order for the main course. I ordered the baked penne, and my roommate ordered the chicken Marsala. During our order the server gave us the option of soup or salad. I got the soup, which was minestrone, and my roommate went with the salad. 
Our server filled our waters without us having to ask, and kept us informed on the progress of our main course. Once the calamari was finished she cleared our plates and went to get our main course. 
She brought our main course out one at a time (probably because the help she needed was napping in another booth off in the corner, where I saw him). Once she placed our food down she asked if we needed anything else: We said no, and she took off after saying "enjoy your food guys." 
The calamari was covered in breading and had good flavor, despite its being mushy in texture (It came with ranch, marinara, and cocktail sauce). My minestrone soup was bland and lukewarm, the salad my roommate had was in his words, "pretty good." My baked penne looked really good, but fell just shy of making par. The penne was cooked perfectly and there was plenty of ground Italian sausage (which was very good). However, the sauce was a bit watery, and the cheese that was on top was a bit rubbery. I asked my roommate how his chicken marsala was, and he said it was great. I can't say much more than that since I didn't eat it. 
After we had finished as much as we were going to eat; the server cleared our plates and asked if we would like any dessert. Since my roommate and I were full, we said no to the offer of dessert after she listed a few of the options to spark our interest. The options sounded good, but we were just too full from our meal.
Our server thanked us for coming in when she brought our check back to the table after we paid. As we left, the Hostess station was empty but we still got a, "goodnight and thanks for coming in" from somebody, who I did not see anywhere.  Over all, the service was great and made up for my food that wasn't great, but not bad. I might try going back sometime to try another dish, and maybe find a different kitchen crew working.I have been to this Landis a few times over the last 10 years or so and it's a pretty good place to get some help and they have a good selection of brands to choose from.  

Staff was help full helping me pick out my new bike, but I kind of already knew what I wanted from what I saw on the Internet.

I ordered my bike, they said should be on Wed. so I called on Thurs. morning and they said "yeah we got it but we need to put it together, call you when it's done."    ---FYI it takes about 15 minute to put a bike together.

So I went on Fri. morning (they didn't call) and they had it almost done and took about 10 min to finish.     

Kinda made me mad they were so blase about it.If I could go with 3.5 stars I would....

We ended up here courtesy of US Airways when we gave up our seats and needed to spend the night.  I was terrified they'd ship us to some Motel 6 in the middle of the dessert, but actually the room was very clean.  They also have deodorant in the vending machine, a major bonus if you need to stay there without your luggage.  We had been told by the airline they had free breakfast, which was not the case though.  They do have a free shuttle to and from the airport, and a nice pool.  Again, not a bad hotel.  But after staying the nights before at a luxury suite in Sonoma County on my honeymoon, it just clouded my opinion a bit.....My girlfriend and I were craving some Indian food so we looked up this place on Yelp and decided to hit it up while we were in Tempe. We ended up getting the lunch buffet, which was overall just OK.  The Saag Paneer was disappointing, while some of the curries were way too salty.   However on the plus side the garlic naan and the chicken tikka masala were delicious and the chicken tandoori wasn't bad.  Also the service was very friendly.  It may have just been an off day but I can only only give it 3 stars.Its a Staples all right...We went here for my daughter's birthday a few days ago. I was really interested because I've been to some very modernized Red Robin's in my day. The only thing my 4 year old wanted was Mac 'n Cheese and there's is good. 

What do I like? I like the bottomless steak friends (believe me, they are bottomless!) and the bottomless speckled lemonade. Yummy strawberries in the drink itself! 

Typically the burgers are good and I am picky, but this time mine was under done and that really bothered me. Also, our waitress was not very fast at all. She barely even came and when she did bring more lemonade, she just dropped it by without asking if we needed anything else. 

They do have a free sundae for birthdays, but they didn't try to upsale dessert to the rest of the party before bringing it out (they could've made a few more bucks if they had!)

Overall, not bad, but I've been to better.I just expect so much more in wings especially when the place is named after it. Can't really say anything about the food. Never impressed. The beer is cold and great for watching Football.They offer lots of great deals including a 24-day guest pass. It tends to get pretty busy, so you might want to go in there on off hours. Otherwise, I like this place. They just need to get more machines so I dont have to go at 8 at night or 3 in the morning to get a machine.Smells like feet in there!!!  I have not roller staked in 10 years so my body forgot and I fell.  OUCH!!!  We went with a B1G1 coupon.  The place is run down.  And bathrooms are a little gross.  The music was good and the staff was nice.This is a no frills delicious place to get some quick mexican food. The food authentic and fresh and I have never diliked anything i have gotten there. You can't go wrong. The salsa bar is only okay and i am a salsa whore so this but this is probably a big point for a great mexican place.I have had this place when service was REALLY good and when it was REALLY bad. It just happens to be my brothers fav so we went again last Sunday. The wait staff took over 8 minutes to acknowledge our presence once we were seated, and then another 6 minutes to bring our drinks. I normally would let this slide but there were maybe 5 tables of patrons and 3 waitresses at 2 in the afternoon. The other waitresses were bustin their butts, we just happened to get stuck with the lousy one. 

We ordered fried pickles and chili cheese fries to start. The fried pickles are always great so no complaints there, but the chili cheese fries were not my cup-o-tea. I want chili carne or chili sauce on my fries - not a bunch of beans. We all had various BBQ meat sandwiches which were pretty standard and also pretty greasy but I guess that comes with the territory when you are eating BBQ. 

I am not a Guy Fieri fan - not sure if its due to the fact that he started pimping TGI Fridays or that he looks like he's the lead singer for a Smash Mouth cover band but it slightly annoys me that Thee Pitts Again has his face plastered all over. We get it Thee Pitts Again - you were on TV once...Awesome...Now let me eat my ribs.To be honest, I expected more from this place. Again, it is a Triple D eatery yet I wasn't too pleased with the food. I watched this segment on Triple D and the food looked amazing! Unfortunately, I didn't get the same quality as it looked like on TV. I ordered the pulled pork with a side of their potato salad and I wish it was better. 

The pulled pork, which already had BBQ sauce on top, was still too dry for me. The portion definitely was not a lot for the price it reflected. I feel like I paid too much for that meal. 

A few positives that I found were: Before the entree, we ordered the deep fried sampler which was really good! And the dipping sauce that accompanied it was just perfect for the dish. What was also good was their potato salad. This was probably one of the best potato salads I've had. Really well done on those two! 

The service was also nice! The lady was really kind and attentive to our table, even though there really weren't many people in the restaurant. But she still catered to us. 

The place is very diner-like which was nice. Colorful and a little different.

Overall, I grade this place a C. I wasn't too pleased with their specialized items. I could probably find a better BBQ place than this spot and I don't think I would come here again. Enjoy!It's hit or miss at this particular store. At lunchtime-it's great. At dinnertime-not so much. You can definitely tell the difference between the lunch and dinner crew. The line is kept up and the store is clean at lunch. The tables are bussed and the drinks are kept full at lunch. At dinner..again not so much. 

Soups are very good, bread items are ok, hot foods are not very good in selection and just blah at best. The salad bar is fresh though and the selection is plentiful. 

The servers are again very hit or miss. The lunch crew is nice and personable. The dinner crew--well let's just say they spend A LOT of time in the back....hiding. This would be ok if we could get our own drinks, but when you depend on a server to bring you a drink and your glass has been empty for 1/2 hour...not so much. 

The best part about Souper Salad is the price. The "other" salad bar is almost $10 per person and that is just insane for salad. The "not so much" parts about Souper Salad are a bit more tolerable when the price is not an arm and a leg.Really nice people.  The food is ok.  I thought it would be better.  Everyone's taste in Italian food is different thoughI have been told, oh how good Bill Johnson's is, there breakfast is the best!!!! I don't think so! Daughter's boyfriend wanted to take me out to breakfast. So he took me here, he likes this place a lot. Daughter likes there breakfast a lot? I have no reason to come here a lot!!! Actually, this was my only visit. Did not impress me at all. I had there over easy eggs, hash browns, bacon, and a side of pancake. I do admit, I liked the pancakes. There eggs, hash browns, and bacon were just alright. Nothing special, no special flavor, just alright. Service was fine, other than that, I have no reason to make another special trip.There is perhaps no better place in Sedona to take in a good meal and a fantastic view. The restaurant is built on a hill that affords awesome views of Sedona. The outdoor terrace is a great place to sip wine during sunset.
I don't think they can quite decide if they are a three star or a four star place. It's either an upscale three star or a four star minus, but either way it's an enjoyable place to go. Probably a 3.5 star restaurant with 4 star pricing....yeah, that's about right.
You can't go wrong with calamari as an appetizer and they serve a damn good wedge salad.
Among their better entrees are the lamb and the filet. They usually have prime rib as their special on Saturdays and it is one of the best I've had. Not a huge cut but is is flavorful with a slightly smokey taste. The side of au jus really isn't needed but the creamy horseradish adds the necessary extra bang.
They serve up a nice creme brulee as a desert and they also have a nice wine list with some reasonably priced pinot noirs.
The service is always friendly and the food is good, so while you probably won't want to propose here (or return here in twenty years to relive your proposal) you could do a lot worse than to treat yourself to nice meal and awesome view at Shugrue'sNothing really stood out, they do have a Buffett but the section I had was nothing to right home about. They did have a nice salad/fruit bar. The casino section was clean but just seemed ordinaryCame here a few times before and was quite frankly not impressed. The store is a little outdated. For such a large store they really don't have that many employees on staff.  I waited in the sneaker isle for help for ten minutes and nobody came over to assist me. However the store does have a nice variety and selection which makes up for the lack of assistance. I would most likely return just because of its proximity to my house, other than that nothing else really wowed me about this store.I wanted to give this place more stars because of the service. Honestly, its pretty impressive how nice they are considering that they are located in a mall food court and have to deal with rude, hurried shoppers all the time. They were very courteous about my groupon and explained the different pitas they offered over the phone while i placed a carryout order. Service wise, these guys were top notch-- very accommodating, very patient, very polite.

I ordered two of their original gyros, a chicken fajita gyro, and an ultimate chicken gyro which came with feta cheese and lettuce. It's definitely not bad. Their gyros are packed with meat. You honestly shouldn't be ordering fries if you are already getting one of their wraps-- it's surprisingly filling. The quality of the meat was so-so. Better than your average fast food style gyro-- the meat seemed to be more thickly sliced. (Don't ever buy a gyro at a place that doesn't explicitly specialize in middle eastern or Greek cuisine) However,  I think you're better off eating the gyros at nearby Greek Bistro. They added sliced tomatoes--pretty standard stuff. The bread was ok, thick but I would have preferred something that wrapped a bit better. But ultimately, the sauce just didn't impress me that much. I was expecting more of an authentic, cucumber based hint to it and it didn't taste much different from standard plain yogurt. Not saying that it WAS yogurt-- I really don't know what it was. But it didn't impress me.

The specialty gyros we tried were decent. The fajita style gyro is definitely different. They used what tasted like yellow american cheese and grilled bell peppers and onions. A tasty alternative to a chicken burrito you might find at your average fast food mexican place. But just ok. The ultimate greek chicken did have that tasty feta cheese in it but it didn't blow me away. The chicken was plentiful but could have been juicer. I think it would have been preferable if they had used chicken kabob instead of sliced bits of chicken breast. 

At no point during the eating of the aforementioned products did I think this place was bad or regret my purchase. At the same time, there was no point at which I found myself moaning in delight over the flavors. These guys are probably a good bet if you find yourself in the mall food court, but I otherwise wouldn't recommend them as an outing when there are noticeably better greek places nearby in Henderson. Despite my lukewarm review, I WOULD come back here again in the future, but probably only with another groupon, or to try some of their dessert options.Met up with a high school friend who now resides in Nevada.  We had just finished a tour of Hoover Dam (because we're nerds) and decided on grabbing dinner in Henderson somewhere.  So we were left with Sammy's Woodfired Pizza.  I don't know how this came to be the only choice.  But seeing as to how I've never had it before, I was a go.

Had the LaDou's BBQ Chicken pizza.  Not bad at all.  In fact, I finished the whole pizza minus one and minus the crust.  I think I may need to give this place a second try in California.Good, but overpriced. Paid $12 for a pastrami sandwich. It was good, but either needed to be bigger or a few bucks cheaper.I agree with the staff review...very plain and robotic. Payless has come a far way. I never used to shop for shoes here because they were such cheap quality but have gotten a lot better!! I come here mainly for the jewelry! Great prices and cute styles!Came here today to get some of my Xmas shopping done and had fun looking at all the new toys for the kiddo's. It was surprisingly tidy. Thats not usually how a toy store is. But it was nice not having to trip over things. I found some items after being helped by some teenager..who was also very nice. My only problem was with the cashiers. They only had 2 lines open and it was the 1st day for both the girls. Lame! So it took forever to check out. They should have more than 2 open and have some people who know what they are doing.
I also came here last year for Black Friday and scored some crazy good deals..but it was a zoo. Hopefully I wont have to go this year but I most likely will. I am a sucker for a good sale. Lets pray the cashiers get alot of practice before then!I got a chicken sandwich with avocados & wasn't really impressed. Our server was slow & forgetful too.I heard some kids at the local Target call this the "ghetto" Wal Mart.  I still don't agree.  Yes, there are people in their dirty sweats to shop. There were several beat up cars in the parking lot loudly playing music .At the McDonald's inside for an Egg McMuffin and coffee, it smelled like vomit.  Another customer asked the security guard about it and he nonchalantly said, "Yeah, about half hour ago." Maybe I read him wrong, but it sounded like a common occurrence the way he talked.  They certainly didn't use bleach like they're supposed to. The McDonald's tables and  floor were dirty but at least the Egg McMuffin that I had to wait for was freshly made.  The store bathrooms were not very clean either.

The store was a bit cleaner but as far as selection and quality, very hit and miss. Produce wasn't fresh (sweet corn husks were dry enough to be decorations),  lots of shelves were bare, but I can forgive that right after Thanksgiving.  The watermelon I bought wasn't sweet at all, not good since I almost bought two of them at $4 each.  The clothing selection only had even numbered inseams which means a $6 tailor job.  

On the good side electronics were well stocked and so were most clothing. A lot of the great Black Friday deals could still be found throughout the store at 10 AM, including their 32 inch flat screen TV.  Checkout was slow but not bad for a Black Friday.  Lots of managers were on hand to resolve problems.

Prices are good though, and the cashiers really worked hard to be fast and courteous. And employees really do try to help you out. But I think the new Wal Marts about five miles north are a way better shopping experience over all.I have been here multiple times, all from getting their groupon.

The food always tastes good, most of the time I get the calamari and the Mezzelune di Vitello con Porcini, a veal stuffed pasta in a cream sauce with mushrooms, peas, and prosciutto. 

The only times where I was disappointed with the food was when I got the caesar salad and another time I got a cannoli. The dressing for the caesar was very underwhelming, with most of the salad consisting of the more stalky parts of romaine. The cannoli cream in the cannoli wasn't smooth and creamy, I guess they used ricotta so it was chunky and pasty/gritty.

The service is always top notch. I am always offered more bread, red sauce if I don't want the oil and vinegar that normally comes with it, I am always seated and served promptly, and my drink always remained full. The waiters are always knowledgeable about the menu and are always friendly.

My only main complaint with the place is the portion size of the dishes in combination with the price. It isn't so bad since I am paying half price with the groupon, but I would most likely feel ripped off if I was paying full price. The calamari is 13 bucks and barely  fills half the plate, especially since the other half is used for the saucer of marinara that comes with it. The veal stuffed pasta comes to 19 bucks, and it was never filling. While it always tastes awesome, the pasta never has that much filling in it, and there is never more than 10 of them on the plate, perfectly spaced out to cover the plate. If you are paying almost 20 dollars for a pasta dish, you should leave feeling full and satisfied, not continually asking for more bread and carbonated soda to not leave hungry.

The food is good, at least the things I consistently get like the pasta and calamari. I just wish there was more on the plate for the price they are asking. As long as they offer a groupon here, I will keep coming. I would never pay full price for this place.When I came in to eat here I was under the notion that it was 50 cent wing tuesday, seeing signs outside even telling me that as well as inside. But when I sat down they told me they had raised the price on it, so it was now more. It was annoying but it didn't stop me from eating.
I had the hot wings (As you should at a place known for wings). I am too use to hit things so these little babies had little to no effect. The wings were very small so there wasn't a lot of meat to each wing. It was extremely hard to flag down my waiter to get a refill, plus he was very rude to me.
All in all though the wings tasted good and thats all that really matters in the end.Adams family / Munsters house meets Vegas. A very unique boutique hotel off the strip. We found the staff friendly with the exception of the restaurant staff. They were almost non existant. Terrible service. The pool was a great place to hang out and listen to the DJ spin.  Happy hour prices are on the high side $6 for a beer. Drinks by the pool are $12. The after hours party starts after 10 and rocks all night into the morning. We woke up to 2 couples screaming and fighting in the hallway on our floor. We called the front dest and they quickly responded and threw the guests out.Time fill up my fridge at the Rio. So, I head over to Food 4 Less to get some goodies for my friends and myself. 

I drive up and when I get out of the car, I see this small girl pushing all these grocery carts. She seems like one of those geeky, nerdy girls. I felt sorry for her, but she is trying to earn her $$$$. I walk in and WHEW...it was COLD. Thank God for Air Condition.

This Food 4 Less seems like the one back in Los Angeles, EXCEPT, the checkout lines. Its hard to describe, but I usually load my items on the conveyor belt in a certain direction. Phoebe was my cashier and she was very nice. Asking if I was all right...lol..It was hot outside and I was sweating. Oh well.

I can't go into details about what I bought, but it was to keep hydrated and nourished. A lot of the other customers were quite friendly. I bumped into a lot and they were laughing it off. This location is only 1-2 miles west of Sahara. Not bad to find some cheap stuff after paying so much. 

Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!First day of summer + making it to Vegas within 4 hours during EDC weekend called for a celebration of only one thing: a hot bowl of pho in the Vegas heat -.-

Hits:
* Big restaurant with lots of seating (that still feels hole-in-the-wall) so I'm assuming if there is a wait, it isn't long
* For large parties, they can easily split the tab at the cashier when you're closing out the check
* Decent pho, but nothing extraordinary that stood out
* A server dropped off a water pitcher at our table for us to refill ...Good call!
* A pho place that takes card in Chinatown :)

Lessons Learned:
* Leave the French drip filter alone if you don't want your coffee to drip slower than molasses

I'll come back with friends if they suggest it, but I'd rather go elsewhere to cure a hangover.This place's best deal would have to be their all you can eat buffet. They have one for dinner after 11 pm, and one for lunch. $16.99 or $13.99 is way cheaper price than some other korean places. I wouldn't recommend the squid because it came as a whole piece and not flavored. You should get the beef flank or marinated beef - those are pretty good. comes with salad bowl. I got the seafood beef tofu soup - not that great. I had it extra-spciy. Basically mean they add more red pepper, but not spicy. And the soup had like clam shell pieces, so I get this random "crunch" sound when I bite. Their appetizers are probably one of the best, if not the best I have in vegas. seaweed, fish/tofu strip, soybean sprouts, kimchi, cucumber, onion pancake (best), clear noodle.I've only been to Meatheads once and it was for a show. My friend's band was playing a show and I always take time out to go hit up bars to listen to their music. I'm a huge supporter of local music.

Meatheads is a small, skinny bar. At the end is where they have their concerts and they have comedy nights (so I've heard, but have not seen). It's in a strange location, in a large Wal-Mart shopping complex, shoved in between a Jamba Juice and a Panda Express. Makes me wonder if the bar had been there for awhile and then those chains just popped up later...

Anyway, it's a nice little neighborhood bar. The bartender was attentive for the most part. However - the fact that this place hosts bands is just so weird to me. The tiny space just does not make is very conducive. BUT I still had a good time and maybe being crammed into such a small place had a little bit of charm, like "oh we're all getting in here to see this band and listen to the music and it's gonna be loud and in your face!".

It's a bit far away from where I live and I doubt I'd ever go back there just to have a drink and hang out. But if there was another band that was playing a show there I'd definitely go.We usually stopped by to get boba on the way home to OC. Boba here is better compared to other places in Chinatown.Items selected

With friends in town for the second weekend in a row since moving to Sin City and my temporary housing located on Spring Mountain Road it seemed only logical to begin the morning with a long run and predawn visit to the iconic Ronald's Donuts.  Small and humble, a true 'old-world' donut shop with bad coffee and all the classics but none of the fuss, it was no real surprise that on my arrival a typical scene appeared; old men shooting the breeze, smiling clerks occasionally weighing in, and a slow but constant trickle of patrons gathering pink boxes of still-warm pastries to go - mine containing a hefty half dozen.  Modest in my expectations even amidst the historical praise my tasting of Ronald's work began with a tangy and delicate buttermilk bar and progressing through options both yeasted and cake including an impressive tiger tail and seemingly half pound bear claw chalk-a-block full of apples it was not until I reached the greasy and overly processed tasting 'apple burrito' that Ronald's would stumble, a theme also notable in the sizable but otherwise underwhelming apple fritter - an item made far better at Friendly, Coco, and Pinkbox.This place was a disappointment. I was totally looking forward to getting some Chinese food the day I ate here. I did a delivery order, and the person who took my order was so very rude. Our food did arrive hot but I don't know about fresh. The food was so bad I didn't even finish it.Stopped in for lunch today because of all of the great reviews. I came in by myself and was greeted by a female waitress that didn't seem very happy. I was seated and ordered my drink. I asked about the lunch specials she looked borderline upset. I ordered the salt and pepper pork chop which was fantastic, I then decided to order the Crab Rangoon. About 5 minutes later I see an order of the lovely little cream cheese  babies headed my way...NOT...the waitress passed my table and put them on the table next to mine, ok fair enough they must have ordered them also. Not the case, 3 minutes later the other waiter comes and picks them up from them and says to me they are making me new ones. Not possible in the less than 1 minute they were in the back. I told them I did not want them. They should have left them on the other peoples table and REALLY made me new ones. But I will say the food tasted wonderful, they just need some skills in service!!Woooow... I had no idea this place was more famous for their male strippers than their females up until I saw these pictures as I am reviewing. And lucky for me, I was able to experience both! Free limo ride to the club and they pick you up from wherever you're at. Cover is $25 which includes 2 drinks but not gratuity.

If you wanna see the male strippers, they take you up the elevator and you'll walk into a room filled with screaming, howling women. The vibe is more fun up here. The guys bring chairs up to the stage and grab birthday girls and bachelorettes to perform lapdances while the entire crowd goes wild.

The waitress upstairs was beyond rude. Not only did she question the drinks that we ordered, but basically ordered our drinks for us. On top of that, she FORGOT some drinks. If you're going to suggest how we want our drinks to be made to make YOUR job easier, at least get it right. No apologies, just a scoff and returned to slam our drinks on the table. AND the drinks tasted like shit. I should've just stuck with soda. Our table was still filled with half the drinks when we left to have a better time downstairs.

Downstairs with the female strippers has a more sexy, laidback vibe. The girls are just funner to watch because they're more graceful. They have that pole dancing advantage and I love watching them climb up and twirl upside down! The waitresses are a lot nicer here as well.

I think I'll just stay downstairs from now on.This place was a disappointment to me. 

It did have some real interesting items ( such as some antique quack medical equipment , some neat Dodge bookends, and I really dig the art done using vintage lighted grapes! ) but everything is a) dusty, b) highly or overly priced, and c) information and help is hit or miss.

I also found the store layout challenging and not layed out very well. Did I mention the grime and dust?

I expected more. But I'm told it changes rapidly and there's lots of finds if you have the time and moula!This is a very decent place....I think I might like it more than Sbarros!  It's located in the food court of Las Vegas Premium Outlets.  The workers are very hard working, and very efficient.  Their pizza was good, although they could be a little less stingy with the toppings, and the prices were not that bad.  I also ordered a salad, which had little itty bity bits of chicken (which was okay with me cause i didn't really want it for the chicken) but they had feta on it...and it was actually good feta, not too salty.  So that was a plus.  I would order here again.It's not the Rio buffet, but it's fine for what it is: a decent salad and soup bar, especially at $6.49 a person.  I'm not sure what the previous reviewer expected for that price.

Four soups, several pastas, and lots of salad items, plus pizza and potatoes.    Mushrooms could've been fresher, and soft serve was too soft.  On the other hand soft drinks (extra $) had free refills and you could take a refill with you.I miss the two dollar bloody Marys.  The bartenders are friendly, but not very good at mixing drinks.  Joey the manager is a super nice guy.  They  sometimes use jiggers to mix drinks.  I am fine with that.  It means I won't get a weak drink.  And I don't always want a strong drink.I like it. I do. Just not a whole lot.

Hit up this PT's just a few nights ago for an outing with coworkers. We all arrived shortly after 9 PM on a Tuesday night. There were a few patrons at the bar, but other than that the place was empty. It does indeed have a smokey smell, but it looks really clean and new. There are definitely nice place to sit around tables on couches. The bar area is large a well-lit. There are pool tables and a beer pong table.

My friends and I mostly came for the beer/drinks. We sat at a table near the billiards section as many in my group were playing pool and beer pong. 

I was starving, so I actually had to eat. I selected the Jalapeno Sliders, that come with three mini burgers and some french fries. They were quite tasty, not greasy, not overly done. The jalapenos gave them a nice kick. They were good - but everything on their menu seems pretty pricey to me for it being bar food. My sliders were 9 bucks! I don't mean to be a cheap-skate but usually when I see a bar menu there's *at least* a few items around $5-$7. But not on PT's menu.

Overall I'd come back if I were hanging out with coworkers and this was their choice. But I doubt I'd be back just because I felt like it.This place serves tasty food, but I think some of the meals are overpriced.   My friend raved over her eggdrop soup, and my won ton soup was flavorful. I've been here twice and the entrees have been good. I have no complaints about service; the last time I went a mistake on our bill was quickly fixed with a smile by the server who made the error.  Although this isn't the first spot that will come to mind if I want to take friends out for Chinese food, it's someplace I would return to for my lunch break if I have a few extra dollars.Solid.

Pros:
   Good Service
   Nice Ambiance
   Decent Prices
   Great Garlic Mashed Potatoes
   Good Caesars Salad
   Fresh Bread
   All You Can Eat Crab Legs Specials
Cons:
   Just OK Felit Mignon
   No Years on their Wine Selection
   There are definitely better in VegasIt's your typical golds gym :) definitely one of my favorites in Vegas though. Not usually overcrowded mid-day! multiple squat racks!I can only speak as a visitor.  A friend was in critical condition when he was transported there.  After much surgery and many days of critical care, he was brought out of his induced coma.  He is now in a rehab facility not associated with Summerlin Hospital.

The hospital staff appeared friendly, concerned, and competent.Effiecient and expeditiously assisted with pre-op on xmas eve. Signs or notices need to be larger for people to see, alot of people were confused or lost due to staff being out early on Xmas eve.It's probably the best pho in Las Vegas but of course it can't compared to pho in Little Saigon. The broth is flavorful but they don't give you alot of meat. I ordered pho dac biet (special pho)for  almost $9 but there is only few pieces of meat.I have purchased two cars at this dealership and I sometimes get my maintenance done there.  Service is generally fast, and they have a courtesy car for rides home if the wait is too long.

I like my service associate, but I sometimes get irritated by delays at the service area.A friend of mine who is very familiar with Middle Eastern food was less than satisfied with Kabul, saying the food was not the real thing -- I suppose it isn't, but I've tried various dishes there and some of it is pretty interesting and tasty for what it is. I think that some of the dishes have been toned down or Americanized... Some of the items could've been spicier or might've been fusion dishes. However, their curry was pretty decent if I remember right (not quite spicy enough for me though), my guy likes their salmon, and they have reasonably priced lunch deals.

Service, however, isn't great as some other reviewers have mentioned -- It's pretty slow, so make sure you have plenty of time before coming in.Mediocre in just about every way. Pretty basic Italian food. Not bad, but not particularly good either.They really deserve two stars but they have a salad bar.  The pizza is pretty tasteless and the other items aren't any better.  A good portion of their marketing is focused toward children and for my son this is a favorite stop.  For him they provide a decent product and fun in the arcade.  Not as gross as other children's places like Chuck E Cheese or Fast Forward...I stopped in here for dinner since I was staying at the Radisson which is where this is located. Service was excellent with the bartender being very friendly. Used my yelp check-in offer for a beverage. I agree with the other reviewer that mentioned the use of carpet. It just made the otherwise well-kept restaurant look dingy.

I ordered the cobb salad even though the ingredients were not typical: kalamata olives, shaved carrots, and guacamole instead of avacado. Before I go further, the bread that comes out with the meal - according to the waiter - is from an Amish bakery and to die for. Kind of a sweet sourdough roll. Yummm.

The salad does come together in a strange sort of way but I could think of ways to improve it. Fortunately, the guac was handmade and not from a tube (which is what I feared) I still would have preferred fresh avacados. Secondly, the lettuce needs more green, so an upgrade from iceberg would be nice: romaine or a mix maybe. Also, beets would be ideal or at least offered as an option.Went here today for lunch. Got the beef brisket sandwich with provolone on onion potato bun with fries and a soda. The beef was super tender and juicy and the fries were some of the best I've ever had (they're battered and very crispy). 
The downfall is that this is somewhat of a cafeteria environment (noisy and you stand in line to get your food) and they still charge nearly $12 for a sandwich, side, and soda. I was also not asked to pick my side - I wanted soup - but they threw the fries on there without asking. While the food was delicious, it was overpriced with mediocre service. I might go back but it's unlikely.If you want a burger customized to your own taste with the standard condiments at a cheap price, in a Bonanza style setting with wood benches and tables, then this is the place to go in Phoenix.

There is a choice of about 6 different style burgers to choose from cooked to order on a wood fired grill.  If you want a cheeseburger, there are 3 or 4 different cheeses to choose from.  I love the fact that there is a condiment bar where you are free to pile on as much stuff as you want, hello pickles, hello mustard, hello mayo, hello tomatoes.  You even get your choice of white or whole wheat bun!

The soda fountain features some unique choices including red pop, and there is a good selection of sides that you can order  including chili cheese fries.  The decor is all Old West and I fully expected to hear a lady in a cowboy shirt and a 10 gallon hat ring a triangle to let us know our food was ready.  Seating is ample.

OHW is unfortunately just another burger joint with nothing special warranting more than 3 or 3.5 stars, but it's a consistent meal at a fair price.I would rate them higher based on food alone but based on everything else, I just can't.  

First, this is how lobster should be done. Ginger, green onions, thick sauce. None of that simply boiled with clarified butter stuff. The fish was also very good and cooked right. The roasted pork had a wonderful crisp on the skin but the section we got had too much fat and not enough muscle..and the grease sopped down into the plate so it was hard to eat.  We wanted the 2nd tier ($36) family set but they were out of clams so we asked if she could just subtract the price of the clams or to let us know what the total price would be. The waitress gave a stank face and just walked away and never acknowledged us again until our food came a long time later. Price for 3 items separately was the same as the 4-item family deal...wth. We compensated with a lesser tip.

The rice was obviously old and not reheated enough to even be warm. Utensils have that film over it that stays when not properly scrubbed. I was handed a set of chopsticks with just one stick.  People just walk up to the counter and grab their own boxes, forks, crab crackers etc.  

Come here expecting good, authentic food but knowing the waitress hates the world and that you'll have to wait to eat, even when not very busy. I'll be back for that lobster though.Typical bland Phoenix style Mexican food.  It wasn't fantastic and wasn't awful.  I had the Relleno and Enchilada platter.  The enchilada had way too much red sauce, and the relleno had cheddar cheese-I'm use to having it with asadero.  The Caldillo sauce had greasy ground beef in it.  Would of been 10x better without the ground beef (Gosh at least I hope it was ground beef).  The rice was standard Macayo/Garcias type and the beans were really good.  I would go back but not on my oh my gosh I have to go there again list.They do have lots of flavors to chose from, but the prices are extremely high for ice cream. I was expecting to be wowed with the prices and I wasn't.Very tasty, authentic dim sum restaurant
Kinda like tapas with small dishes
Steam push carts are wheeled around the restaurant
You point to what you like to have placed on ur table
Bad, old decor. Was afraid to go ladies room but was clean.
Even worse customer service, almost nonexistent

The steam push cart ladies were nice but no English or Chinese
Apparantly some are other ethnicity
If on budget, to feel full those little dishes add up. 

Visited with family of 8 towards end of a busy wkend brunch 
We are seriously easy to serve ppl
We were constantly looking around the huge dining rm for service.
We had to ask several times to different ppl for tea refills, condiments.
So frustrating I was losing my temper on a nice brunch w family.
.
If you really dont mind, super bad service, 
then the food is good.Saredella's Ultimate.  Memories of a time gone by.

Back in the late eighties, my high school friends and I would hold regular Thursday evening get togethers to watch Married With Children and The Simpsons on the fledgeling Fox network.
...and we always ordered a Sardella's Ultimate:
Large Cheese Pizza and 50 wings for 11.99 (back then).

Oh sure, they still sell pizza, and they stil sell wings, but over the years they've gone from a super fresh neighborhood REAL pizza parlor (this is THE original location) to a generic, uneven quality "local-chain" of pizza stores. 

No fancy ingredients: the last time I tried to get a Hawaiian style, they had no Canadian bacon, only ham, not as slices, but tiny diced bits with a yucky flavor, and just as oily as pepporoni would have been, anyway.  No artichoke or banana peppers or anything like that either.

On the positive, they do have cheap deals, and are regular sponsors of local kids' sports teams and other community stuff.  I remember getting a coupon for a free medium pizza when I moved into my house.

I wish the Sardella's family continued success, but hope that someone within recognizes that their restaurants just aren't what they used to be.Good, standard food. Definitely a chain that's consistent - I've been to several around the country, and they're all pretty much the same. I go for meetings, but only once in a while on my own. It's a bit pricier than similar chains, and doesn't really offer anything to offset the cost difference....and the challenger "Dance Stuffed in My Pocket" recieves...

3 and 1/4 Stars

Pink Lotus is a decent, clean, hole-in-the-strip-mall americhino classic.

Their extensive menus includes all the basics, prepared hot and fresh for you to takeout or dine in, as long as the odd mural on the wall doesn't scare you off.  (pic)

The food was pretty good.  General Tsao's chicken is a barometer to me, and Pink Lotus' rendition was a little different.  Think more along the lines of spicy terriyaki than hoysin.  But there were lots of bits of green onion and minced FRESH garlic (I'm still getting garlic burps).  The consistency, as well as the flavor that was underneath the sauce, was more like rough chopped chunks of crispy fried chicken than the usual batter-balls.  Good but a little greasy.

Pink Lotus is pretty generous with giving small discounts to deserving community members like military or helathcare workers (pic).

They've been hidden on the outside edge of this shopping center for years and I'd never noticed them before.
With lunch specials at around $5-6 including drink, more menu research must be done here, clearly.Friday 10/04/13 I have been looking for a good place for take out / that delivers Chinese food. Carol didn't want to cook so we decide to call here for take out considering they left a menu on our door and we never tired this place.

This is Americanized Chinese food, not authentic Chinese food. The prices are unbeatable at this quality, speed, and flavor! This place is good for delivery Chinese food.  I didn't have high expectations with delivery food but I enjoyed the food from this restaurant..  

As far as Americanized Chinese food goes, it's pretty good. The food isn't dripping in oil and grease and portions are fair. Service was good and the restaurant itself was brightly decorated

I ordered my old stand by Shrimp with lobster sauce and Carol ordered her favorite dish Moo Shu Pork. Both dishes came with rice, eggroll fried wonton and crab puffs.

We also ordered Won Ton soup which was the best I have had from a local  Chinese restaurant. Seriously the soup is great here!!

When our order arrived everything  was piping hot and in a box so nothing spilled. The food is OK. Alright maybe slightly better than ok. So far the most decent Chinese food I've had around here.

FOOD: The menu is standard Chinese take out. SERVICE: Could hardly understand the person who answered the phone. Food was delivered hot and quickly. CONCLUSION:  The food was decent and the price was right. RETURN  FACTOR: 100%

************************ What does my overall ratings mean *****************************

5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 
4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 
3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 
2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 
1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENTFor the price, the pizzas is pretty good. A WHOLE lot better than Dominos, which costs about the same. Their wings are good too. Unfortunately they raised prices recently. Wings are a bit on the high side but the pizza is still competitively priced. Still pretty good pizza.place sucks, but i get paid to get the truck washed hereThis is a nice little thrift store.  The clerks aren't real friendly but they have a wide variety of merchandise for mostly reasonable prices and I always find a few things to buy.  As with any thrift store, you just never know what they will have in stock on any given visit so it's worth it to just stop by once in awhile to see what's new.The food & atmosphere are good, but the prices are a joke considering it is downtown chandler. I've had friends say their food has been bad, but mine has always been good. 

Oh yea, and charging for chips....WEAK. Unforgiveable actually.Oh yeah baby - Blackjack out in the middle of nowhere! 

Even on a vacation that I did not even think about going to a casino we happened to find this Harrah's and had to drop in for a little gambling action.

This location itself is located a good drive from Mesa where we were staying but since we had been in Phoenix it was not too far. The casino itself is on the small side, but has a decent amount of slot machines and table games set right in the middle. Buffet, steaklhouse, and cafe on site. What I found surprising is that they have a self serve coffee and soda stand for the patrons which was pretty nice.

As it was a Tuesday night I couldn't believe how crowded it was. Don't know where all these people come from considering it's kind of a desolate location. Children of the corn out here. Still, it's a decent little casino with enough games to play. Did not notice too much cigarette smoke and it seemed pretty clean. I thought the casino staff was friendly overall too.

We even walked away with an extra $100 so that is #winning!After writing checks for $13,000 for a landscape install, two months later all there is, is a trench in the front yard. I am not certain if it will ever be done, if they will voluntarily reimburse me or if a lawsuit is in store. I would not recommend this company to anyone.

Feb 2014 - The employee of Zona Works who was managing my landscape project has been removed from the company.  The work took a very long time to complete because of who was running the project. The work, once done, was very good and the landscape is beautiful.  There has been a problem with the fire pit they built, and the owner, Gary, has promised to correct it even though he does not stand to make any more money to do so.  At this point I do trust that he will stand by his word to correct the issue. With Gary in charge, I would recommend Zona.Good happy hour prices. Vegas roll here is delish and so is there pizza.3.5 stars

I love the quaint style of this restaurant, many cute little rooms and a nice outdoor space. I do recommend you make a reservation for lunch, even during the week.

 I like how everything is organic and fresh.

I like the hummus and spicy pita chip appetizer.

Also the Arcadia Greek Salad which is fresh and rather large. It is just an average Greek Salad though.

The Mediterranean Melt is a winner.

I do think that the prices are a little steep for the product, but it is fresh and the ambiance is nice. 

Parking is a little annoying, but you can valet.
I plan to head for breakfast at Arcadia Farms soon.As far as food goes, this place was a solid 4. Service was a 2. We initially sat outside, but moved in since it took a lot of time to even get a glass of water. Once inside, we spent even more time waiting for someone to bring us the full menus. Apparently they could only spare two for our table. 

The bathrooms were far away... A little strange. 

We ordered beers and received chilled (nice) but 6 ounce (weird) glasses.

On the plus side the food was excellent.  

The green chili pork appetizer was very good as was the dr. Pepper short ribs.This place really scares me sometimes.  I bit into a taco last night and grease literally streamed out the other end.  Luckily I'm already on Lipitor.This is a nice place for a business dinner, but on my own I wouldn't go here. The service is great. The food is OK, maybe a little pricey, but there are no fire works. Actually, I take that back, their creme brulee was pretty amazing, but the Thai food was just OK. I *love* that I don't ever have to worry about something being too spicy or that I might go home with food poisoning (hence why it's good for business dinners), but I never CRAVE their food. There are just too many hole-in-the-wall Thai places with better food that blow this place out of the water.Martini Ranch - kind of a yawn.  Just went for the first time this past weekend.  The crowd and the place weren't what I thought.  I was a bit disappointed, maybe I had higher hopes with the cover charge and the line outside.  We left about midnight - so who knows maybe it got more fun later on.  I'm sure its still a fun place to gather with friends and have a good time - whether you want to chill on the patio, listen to the live band, or dance in a loungey place upstairs. The variety is a bonus...In any event I can now get Devils Martini and Martini Ranch straight now.  I'll go back someday, but I'm not in a big rush.Oh Zipps. I kind of have a mediocre relationship with you. I love the cheap HH, great patio and tons of TVs to watch a game. It's always an option for game day. But, everything else is just pretty run of the mill. And yet, over the years, I've found myself visiting more than I would have ever thought, but I blame my friends and a football game. 

I look at Zipps as the mainstream location to watch a game. When you hear there's a sports game on, immediately one of the first bars that comes to mind is Zipps. And why not? Like I said, games, great prices, large beers, wings, a patio and TVs make for a great game watching experience. But, the food isn't amazing. The only menu item on the list I tend to eat there is the Monaco Foccacia. The foaccia is fresh and warm and full of chicken breast, grilled melted cheese and ranch dressing. Add tomatoes for a twist. Other than that, just run of the mill food and it's actually better to go with the intention of drinking beer and watching a game. I think that's Zipp's intention as well and it seems to be working for them since it's always crowded!3 stars.

TL;DR: pros for good Italian fare, friendly ambiance; cons for selling too hard, and check your bill for miscalculations.

Meal: 4 stars
- (appetizers) Caesar salad; fried calamari
- (entree) scallop oreganata
- (daily special) Chilean sea bass

Ambiance and service: 3.5 stars
- funny, smooth-talking waiter
- sports bar: dim but friendly, buzzing with chatter; lots of bobble heads

Bill miscalculation: 1 stars

Came here with my family late on a weekday evening. I wasn't hungry, so I ordered an appetizer salad ($8). Waiter asked if I wanted to add grilled chicken -- I figured it was $2 or $3 more, so I said yes. Waiter offered garlic bread, to which we declined, but he said he would "throw it in anyway."

The food came in good time and was a solid, Italian meal. Chilean sea bass was tender -- delicious! Fried calamari is fried calamari, but very good. The good-humored waiter came by often to check on us, cracking jokes and whisking away plates.

When the bill came, we noticed a $30+ overcharge!
- My $8 Caesar salad turned into a $20 entree: the waiter said "All our chicken orders are $20." A fair waiter should have notified me if adding grilled chicken on a salad is more than a couple of dollars -- especially if there is no "grilled chicken Caesar salad" entree on the menu.
- The garlic bread that was "thrown in anyway" was suddenly an extra $6.
- Even given these prices, the total was an additional $17 over -- a pure miscalculation.

We notified the waiter and had everything fixed (except for the salad... oh well). Overall, it was $30/person with the correction -- on the pricey side. Ended on a sour note, but had good portions and friendly staff... I would return, but with a greater wariness for the bill.I thought I would be blown away and I was with the amazing view and beautiful decor! however, the food was nothing spectacular and our waitress was clueless!  We all got the tuna tartar, beef carppacio, salmon and ribs. Would I come back? Yes but this time JUST for drinks on the patio. There are too many other yummy restaurants around here to just settle!Trendy place with a spectacular view and wonderful staff, but food was trying too hard to be overly complex. 

Food: 2.6, Atmosphere: 4.5, Service: 4.5

Highlights:
- Location: beautiful space overlooking the mountains with gorgeous sunsets. 
- Atmosphere: super trendified and modern with a fireplace towards the middle of the entry. Bar looked like a great party spot inside as well as the huge patio outside. Place settings featured a bit of east meets west with my favorite item on the table being what I called the ying and yang salt and pepper plate.
- Staff: everyone from the valet to the bus boys were wonderful. Our waitress Hillary was nice and went out of her way to be accommodating to our requests. The water guy was totally on top if it too always refilling my glass which is no small feat since I drink a lot of water. The valet was cute when upon entry he told us what a wonderful night we were in store for and afterwards when discovered we were going back to watch the end of the NFL playoff game he rushed to get our car. 
- Bread and dip: enjoyed the eggplant hummus with ginger and sesame along with the soft rolls spiced a bit on top
- Chocolate rolled cake: my other fave bite if the night. Dense yet soft chocolate cake with a bit of crunch and style with the little circular nubbins scattered on top. Paired with caramel gelato which was jammed packed with that caramel flavor. 
- Pork belly fried rice: nice touch in fat, texture, and added flavor to an already tasty rice
- Check cookies: soft, chewy, and warm mini chocolate chip ones to close out the meal

Midlights:
- Lower booths: love the location right by the window overlooking the view, but they were uncomfortable. The material wasn't giving so it was too stiff and width-wise it was too slim for normal sized people so we were a but crushed together when trying to eat.

Lowlights:
- Seared foie: I almost never can resist ordering it when I see it on the menu, but this was not a very appetizing rendition. Biggest issue here was it way too slimy inside instead of a sear that maintained a structure throughout. The custardy mousse it was sitting on was way too huge--almost a bowl full. The addition I thought was cool individually but not sure fit in to the dish were the peppercorns and carmel rice. 
- Scallops: overcooked to just at the brink of being rubbery. There was too much going on on the plate. Although visually I was impressed by the snap peas being sliced open like birds of paradise flowers, the cheese crisp was overly oily and not crisp at all and seemed out of place in the Asian infused dish.

Not sure if we just didn't order the best items and on food alone I wouldn't return, however the view and service were delightful so I might consider it...I came here naively thinking that I'd be able to find decent sushi here.

There IS a sushi bar. But as far as anything distinctive? Well the whitefish drenched in ponzu was interesting ... I didn't have the heart to tell the chef that he probably should have sliced the whitefish razor thin. They are probably contractly obligated to adhere to the Roy's recipe so can't really fault him there. I have a long conversation with him, where he lamented about how most people in AZ do not have the discerning tongue that we california people do. That's probably true, considering the number of people out here who think Ra's sushi has something to offer other than the legions of hot waitresses.

There is no uni because no one ever orders uni, and if the chef wants uni for himself, he just orders some and eats it before it melts away.

I ordered the Roy's Trio, and it was excellent, especially the butterfish. I just wish that the portions was a little bit bigger.

The chef made me tako nigiri on the house after I commented on the superb piece of tako I had at Hoshi the other day. At Hoshi, the chef cut up the tako so that it resembled shellfish, then draped it over the neta. Unlike many other places which just slice a piece of tako and use nori to affix it to the neta. I tried to explain this to him, but he ended up doing it the normal style.

Still was nice of him to do that  :)we decided to run in the other night to get takeout. I was a bit surprised at the price because instead of a flat fee, they charge something like $4.99/lb so they weigh your container before they charge you. The soup prices were insanely low though, like 4 bucks per large container. 

I'm gonna be honest, this place is a little (alot) divey and I've seen better spreads BUT they have a nice dessert section and some of the usual popular stuff like walnut shrimp and lo mein and etc. 

We ended up walking out for about 18 bucks for two containers worth of food and a large hot and sour soup. Fine dining it is NOT but the food was hot and filled us up. It wasn't the best chinese food we've had but we didn't have to wait, the prices are decent and the food was tasty enough.

I believe it's family run and the owners were nice and friendly when we walked in. It's a nice option for when you're on the run and need a decent meal quickly.Easy to find. Ample parking. I can say that much about this place. 

For me, it's not anything to write home about. In fact, why bother? Well, perhaps you want a pretty central area to meet friends for lunch or after work. Or maybe it's the middle of the weekend and your jonesin' for sushi. Then, go. But otherwise, don't. I mean, really, with a name like Sushi 101, you can expect it to cater to ASU kids and residents down the block. Hey, no biggie, right?

If I were you, I wouldn't bother, though.

Service is good, although during a lunch visit once, I felt almost hurried out the door when all I really wanted was to enjoy my hour break, settle back into the booth and savor each bite. Seems that was too much to ask, for the check came long before 1/2 my roll was eaten. To me, that reeks worse than rotten fish.This place used to be my place to go for pho, but then I had a bad experience (the water tasting funny and the veggies not being so fresh) and decided to try some other places.  (This was during the summer however and I will say that based on the 6 years of living here in Tempe, many of the restaurants that stay open during the summer start to falter with the quality and freshness of their food.  A problem which I hope will be rectified this summer.)   But, given that it has been quite chilly lately and school is still in, I recently decided to give this place another try.

I agree with all the other reviews about this place.  The pho, the portions, the price, and the service are all very good.  No problems with the freshness of the veggies this time.  But I am still adverse to the water (I think it is non-filtered tap water) and one of the lettuce leaves that came with my egg rolls still had some dirt on it.  

Also, note that this place, given the weather and its size, was packed during the usual lunch hour when I visited.  But, the table turnover was pretty quick and you only have to wait a few minutes if at all to get a table.  But, you might have to share a table with someone if you are a single.Pretty good, but very standard. Everything tastes nice, but it's not spectacular. I was very impressed with the service, though. I was out with some friends and my friend's young daughter - the moment we were seated, the waiter brought over some dough for the daughter to play with in order to keep her entertained. Props for that!Some below have said some of the things I will here, but this is my individual review of the newly reopened Tempe Improv.  

We frequented the Tempe Improv before it closed, and we go to Stand Up Live in downtown Phoenix many times a year.  The remodeled Tempe Improv has the same awesome host/hostess and wait staff (yes, I seriously think they are wonderful), much improved restrooms from before (with more stalls and just much nicer), a new menu that really does reflect similarities to StandUpLive's (but is not an exact replica), and a new, horribly uncomfortable, cramped seating arrangement.

I'm not sure why people complain about the two drink minimum.  The requirement is there in black and white when you buy your tickets; both clubs are very up front about that.  I remember the service at the old Tempe Improv being - always - very impressive, and it is still that way. Darlene waited on us this past weekend, and she didn't miss a beat.  She was every bit proactive, helpful and sharp.  Kudos to Darlene.  Every time we hit both the Improv and StandUp, we are truly impressed with the service.  That's not a joke.

Here is why we will probably keep going to StandUpLive downtown and not to Tempe again - important for others to know, I think.  StandUpLive has tables that are basically attached "two tops" that are close together.  Yes, you are sitting very close to the people next to you, and you have to sit across from whomever you came with.  No problem.  This type of seating really works at StandUpLive, but it definitely does not work at the Tempe Improv.  At StandUpLive, the seating is all angled to/from the stage (each line of tables is like a long ray from the sun, which would be the stage, if that makes sense).  Every seat in the house is literally a good seat.  The seating at the Tempe Improv, however - although consisting of similarly styled tables - is cramped, totally thrown in there at different angles, and doesn't work in that space.  We were among the first ten people to arrive at the early show (this is the way to do it so you aren't stuck in a line outside at 10pm, FYI), and yet we were seated more than half way back and at a far side of the room.  (This has never happened at StandUpLive, ever).  There were a few tables near the front that said "reserved", but most of the others said, "VIP! Ask how you can upgrade to this seat".  Really?  We've already paid $80.00 for two tickets, and will be purchasing dinner and drinks.  The price is not a problem, but, sitting so far back with the gimmicky signs in your face is just plain cheesy.  We saw people time and time again shaking their heads about the additional $90.00 price tag for those seats.  Pretty silly.  Once the show started - a Saturday night show with a famous comedian - we saw how many of the "VIP" seats were empty.  The late comers with regular tickets were placed in those seats, adding insult to injury.  No one wants to come to a show two hours early thinking that they will get decent seats only to get so-so seats with an advertisement in their face.  Don't we get bombarded by enough ads all day long?  We came to the Improv to relax and have fun; not to have more items for sale slung at us.

Like others have mentioned, the new Tempe Improv food is literally like buying a $16.00 t.v. dinner.  It's edible, but not good like the old food was there.  Bummer.  I must say that, each glass of wine I ordered was a good (sized) pour.  Awesome.  The mixed drinks around us did arrive in tiny winy glasses, though.  Poor souls.  Do note that the Tempe Improv no longer has draft beer: bottles only, and no Four Peaks anymore.

With tickets, dinner (just meals - no appetizers or desserts), and two drinks each (beer for him and wine for me), our entire night came to $160.00.  With an amount like that, the public is going to evaluate their other options.  There are fantastic, relaxing restaurants out there with comfortable seats; there are movies and theatre performances where the best seats - and you know in advance where you are sitting - cost about what this does.  Many of the seats at the new Improv are stuck in the line of traffic and get rammed whenever the staff goes by.  We saw people get accidentally spilled on because a waiter couldn't get through, e.g.  Not good.  Best of luck to you, new and improved Tempe Improv.  We love to laugh, and thus will not be rushing back.Very good food. I love that they are conscience about Gluten free, organic and local food. Everything here is very good. But all this said, I have to admit that sometimes the veggies are over done or slightly burned or browned from cooking. I prefer to have the veggies steamed then put on the noodles or mixed with the sauce. It seems like the saute the veggies with the sauce and it gets browned and can be not too appealing to the eye, kind of all brown on some dishes. Most of the time the food is good.Large variety of specialty pizzas served by the slice. Small patio area right on Mill for your dining pleasure. Good option for a quick lunch on Mill.Wong's place has been touted as "some of the best in the area" and "Hands down the best Chinese food in the valley."  I'm not from the area so I don't have a lot to compare to but if Wong's is the best in the area, then I'm a bit disappointing that the Tempe area doesn't know what some really outstanding Chinese food should taste like.  

Wong's is a decent average place with mediocre chinese food at reasonable prices.  And the people who work there are very nice people.  It's hard to go wrong with the house pan fried sizzling noodle at any kind of Chinese restaurant (although I wish the noodles were a bit thinner).Ok, I've been to Someburro's a thousand times, and I like it...I really do...
However...the problem that 990 out of those thousand times I've had the Pollo Fundido, simply one of the best fast guilty pleasures that you can experience.  However, after eating it, I feel like I've just dug another inch closer to the grave...or shaved another couple of days off of my life.  As I age...I'm trying to eat healthier, so here I am at Someburro's trying to find something healthy that doesn't give me visions of the grim reaper, and that gives me the near orgasmic feeling that I have when down the Pollo Fundido.  

So far, I haven't found anything else on the menu that fits the bill.  I've tried the veggie burro which is probably the healthiest thing on the menu, and it's....eh....ok.  The avocado in it is great, and I haven't seen them put less than fresh avocado slices in it.  I once tried the taco salad, which was WAY less than satisfying, and actually kind of gross.  I mean, you take some actually healthy stuff and surround it in a bowl of fried whatever...

I'm also not big into shredded beef or the machaca.  The chicken quality is ok, but has a good portion of dark meat in it.  It's good because it's marinated so heavily, though I'd imagine that the marinade does not add to the health quotient.

On the bright side, this place is decent for kids.  There are inexpensive options for little ones. We get the quesadilla's for the boys, who pretty much just pick over the quesadilla waiting for the go-ahead from mom to dive into the Churros.  By the way, the Churros are no bueno, in my opinion.  The kids like 'em cause they are doused in sugar, but they aren't doughy...they are crunchy crispy and fried...fried...fried.  I feel pangs of guilt as if I'm poisoning my children when they eat those.

Some of you reading this are probably thinking...if he's trying to be healthy, perhaps he shouldn't be going to Someburro's in the first place....and you're probably right.Meh... Chimichanga seemed like it was a pre-made, kinda boring. I had something a bit more authentic.. Decent, bit nothing special. The chips are just like Mission out of a bag from Costco..  Like another reviewer mentioned. There are way too many other places in Cave Creek to try.Went on a road trip with friends and we were coming back to Phoenix from San Diego. Hunger had set in and we were thinking a milk shake and fries sounded good. I admit we noticed this place between of the space ship on the roof of the hotel.

The place was clean and our server was very nice. 

We ordered milk shakes and a giant plate of fries. Everything tasted great as far as fries and milk shakes are concerned. 


Vibe was totally in the twilight zone with this place...Pep Boys often carries car accessories that Autozone and SLO-Reilly doesn't. This location is also competitively priced compared to the competition. Service at the parts counter can range from informed to clueless, but usually they have competent help here. 

I won't buy their tires. There's an awful lot of crap Pep Boys tires in the recycle piles out in rural Nebraska where travelers dumped them for something more suitable for the gravel roads and rougher conditions. Their house brand of tires suck, you'll regret buying them. 

But beyond the tires, if you need parts and accessories they're worth a look or a call.We passed through this airport twice on our trip. 

It's a little outdated and I thought more of the shops would be open after 10. 

Loved the slots they have because, I mean, it wouldn't be a Vegas airport without them.It's an okay airport. Definitely not as pretty as Vancouver airport. But there aren't many airports that are nice as YVR (at least the ones I have been to). 

I like that they have a free wifi but in terms of other stuff, there isn't much. No food court or a nice lounging area. They do have a restaurant and Starbucks on second floor but the restaurant had short operating hours. At least, we could rely on good old Starbucks to stay open and provide seating area. 

It was confusing having to take a tram to from one side of the airport to the other but not that bad.Recently, I flew to Vegas for the first time. Living in LA, I've only driven there. Maneuvering around the airport was fairly easy to navigate. When we reached baggage claim, where we arrived 20-30 minutes late, my friend's luggage was waiting near the info desk as a security precaution so it wouldn't get stolen. It was a nice surprise. 

Eventually, we made our way to where the shuttle buses and limos arrive so we could take the WAX bus (public transit). I appreciate that they even have that option opposed to being forced to take a cab.This place is dying....years ago, this place was packed of so much stuff.  It used to be cool coming here...so much things to see/look at, now everything looks just like a leftover...Sad.It is recession time, so we didn't get any free drinks as my friend promised, but still we stayed for a while on the slut machines. Like I'd always say invest, recover then leave. In the end I was tempted to try one of the drink-blends you see many walking with, and here I got my piña colada daiquiri for 14 (medium size).

People seem to love this place because of....beads! Very american thing I guess. You are given 1 free and the option with a raffle to win other "exotic" ones.Yeah it was ok. I'll briefly reiterate what others had already posted. Its a pawn shop. I love the show and was maybe expecting a little too much. There were a few items that were bought on the show. It wasn't as crowded as others on here have complained about. I guess if you go on off hours, you should be ok. But I did drive by another time, and there was actually a Vegas tour bus stopping there with tons of people. I didn't expect any of the guys from the show to be there. If anything it was worth it to buy myself a shot glass and take a picture in front of the sign, just to say that I've been there.Stopped in here for lunch the other day so I could try them out since we just moved in down the block. Found out they had a lunch buffet for $6.50. What a great way to try out a few things on the menu!
The place is pretty out dated inside and the staff was neither great, nor terrible. They were OK for servers during a buffet I guess. The buffet was a bit disappointing as they seemed to put out very little food at a time. Seems they are trying to be very cautious as to not waste food. I appreciate them not wanting to waste food but it makes it frustrating when there is only a spoon full of most items left in the tray when I go up.
As for the food itself, it was about what I would expect for a 6 buck buffet. Nothing spectacular but just decent chinese food. The chicken items (General Tsos and Sesame Chicken) were probably the standouts to me if I had to pick something. The fried rice was a bit disappointing but I would try it again fresh and not off the buffet line.
All in all, not a waste of a trip, especially for 6 bucks! I will give them a try for take out and update my review.The place is very average, but the food is good. I can get away with dinner for two under $30 with tip. If you're into atomosphere and trendiness, it's not for you. If you're not a snob, and want good food at a fair price, this is a good place. 

I don't reccomend it if it's a "first date" and you're trying to impress.This Walmart is on the commute home from work and is not too far from where I am living now in the SW.  It is on the SW corner of Rainbow and Spring Mountain, with a Target store across the street and also diagonally across the street from Greenland Supermarket.  In the same strip mall, there are also Krispy Kreme, Applebees and IHOP.

Maybe it is the convenient location or the fact that this Walmart is pretty clean and well kept, but it seems to always be busy and the closest parking spots can be rather difficult to obtain.

Anyway, of the Walmarts I have shopped at, this one is one of the better ones.  It has the usual large selections of items sold at Walmarts, plus they also have a fairly decent size grocery and deli section, ideal for one-stop shopping for the people with little spare time, parents that have to take their little kids shopping, or someone looking for low price items (many of time manufactured overseas in countries such as China).  As far as the groceries, it seems to be reasonably priced and the meats, fruits and vegetables are look fresh. 

So when I am looking to buy something and not spend too much on it, I will usually give this Walmart a try.  They may not always have the lowest price, but you will typically not pay too much more compared to other retailers. 

3 stars for me.The Rio room we stayed in was nice but not luxurious.  We paid an extra $20 a night and upgraded to a higher room with a view of the strip.  We could see the strip at a distance but the view was still beautiful at night when all the lights came on.  There was traffic noise and some train noise.  There were minor imperfections with the room but nothing I could really complain about.  Be aware that there are sensors in the mini bar in their rooms.  All you have to do is touch or pickup an item and they will bill you for it at $8.25 each.  If you see refreshment charges on your bill then by all means tell them and they will remove the charges.  Also check everything over as our package included two free 24 hour Buffet of Buffet tickets and they didn't seem to be aware of it when we checked in.  The manager didn't help at all until my husband called the agent and they then faxed over the necessary information.  We were told to go buy our buffet tickets and they would comp us for the cost.  When we checked out it appeared they forgot to do this.  More hastle but we did get it straightened out as we were checking out.  We had looked forward to seeing Penn and Teller but unfortunately they weren't there the week we went.  Also the free entertainment other than a few strolling singers were closed down.  Avoid McFaddens if you want to drink as their prices are high and their drinks are terrible.  One good thing was the free shuttle to either Harrahs or Ballys.  My husband had planned to gamble a little but he studied the odds and said that he had never seen them so tight in his whole life.  Also we miss the days of gingling coins and flashing lights.  Everything is silent except for the music.  Oh well all things change I suppose.  I doubt we will return.I had a great view of the strip, but paid 20 bucks a day for that said view. Oh well. That would be no big deal, but it was in the winter, and the pools are drained, and they are quite the eyesore. The concierge was fairly useless, or never answered the phone. My suite was newly renovated though, so it was pretty. it's too far from the strip really for a normal "stay". The shuttles to Bally's and Harrah's helps, though.Finally stopped in today after eying this place for years.

Damn it, another place serving cans of soda, seriously?  It's 2013, not 1983, where are the refills at?  How am I supposed to get my afternoon caffeine kick from one can of soda?

I had the chili mint shrimp lunch special.  Krung's spice level tops out at 5, I didn't know this and asked for a 10, ha h, I think the waiter thought I was slow.  I'm not denying that so after he corrected me I still ordered the 10 spice level ha ha.  Yeah, it was a littler spicier than I planned for but still really good. 

My issue is the serving size...we are in the United States of America, load the plate Krung!  Fatties need fuel!  A few tortilla strips, a scoop of rice, and a small scoop of 'main dish' just isn't cutting it...at least not for the price.

Okay, yeah, I'll come back, but I'm still going to go back to the office after eating here and pound a donut to get me through to dinner time.

On a more merry note, the place was dead at noon so the service was good.We had a party of 12 or so at Little Buddha for a combined bachelorette/bachelor party dinner, where many of us were meeting for the first time. I have some pros and cons about Little Buddha.

Pros:

1. Service. Basically if you give us good service, I'm going to write a good review about you no matter what. Our servers were fantastic, kept the sake coming, graciously took photos of our whole group, didn't seem to mind us being loud and laughing and a bit distracted, and waited patiently until we were ready to order. I was quite impressed with the staff. The hostess even politely said goodbye and thank you to each and every one of us as we left. Very polite.

2. Décor. It's beautiful in there!


3. Menu variety. There was plenty of delicious options to choose from!

4. Everyone else's food. I tried a friend's orange chicken, YUM. The groom-to-be ordered the spiny tailed lobster, which was probably one of the best things I've ever tasted. It had a fantastic creamy sauce generously poured all over it. SO GOOD. 

5. Location. The plan that night was to hit up the Playboy Club and Moon - which were right next door to the restaurant, so we could start getting our party on right after dinner!


Cons:

1. Unfortunately, MY food. I ordered the Pan Seared Atlantic Salmon, which came out and looked beautiful, but was way too dry for a piece of "gourmet" fish. The broth was good to add some moisture, and was nice and tangy, but it just didn't save the fish. I was quite disappointed for a piece of $26 salmon to be that dry.YisssssThis is one of those cheaper resorts that's owned by MGM. For the price that you pay, don't expect it to be like MGM Grand or Mandalay Bay. 

Check-ins and check-outs were flawless, as with the rooms. 

There's no WIFI at all in the rooms, which should have been included with the tedious daily resort fee. But you can walk-up to Krispy Kreme in the food court and use their free WIFI there. 

The arcadium in the resort is horrible.

Also, the pool area can be a little better in terms of decor (ex: plant more palm trees?).Very chain restaurant atmosphere, but they have great cold beer and the garlic fries are a must have!I think this is just another case of hype, and even in this case. It's yelp hype :(

We bought two yards and shared between 4 guys. Got an extra shot of Bacardi 151 for $1.50... mixed in of course, who would ever take a shot of that nasty, cheap stuff by itself YIKES!

Each yard was $14 I believe and we got Mango, so by the end of it we each drank half of a yard and loaded up on sugar and calories but with no buzz what so ever?

Great, we paid over $30 to be loaded up on sugar and syrup... now we're just walking around the strip with a bladder full of piss.

No thanks Fat Tuesday.Seems pretty much like any bagel shop/deli that I've patronized in the northeast- family owned and operated and tons of regular customers of the senior-citizen class. I was about to drop $14 on the Nova platter when the waitress told me about a cheaper option that was exactly what I wanted. Bagels were huge and very tasty and I would come back for breakfast next time I'm nearby. Decor is outdated and so is this part of Vegas, but supporting a local business never goes out of style.Decent clean rooms...

I spent a weekend here after a full business week at the Venetian.  It's not fair to compare this hotel to it's fancier neighbors.  

The room I had was not updated.  It did however have a view of the strip and the pool.  The lack of luxury, refinement and decor may be intentional in order to get you out of the rooms and into the action downstairs.

I've also stayed at the Harrah's RENO (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/arjkq9xxhTjwmncEsXNRmQ?hrid=iIHlVDcjq2I8V7mghTvt1Q ).  The Reno property rooms in the West Tower feel like the "W Hotel" - cool, chic, and modern.  The Harrah's Vegas felt like a retro 80's style Holiday Inn.

3 Stars for the central location, clean rooms, and great service...go in from behind the strip and parking is easy!

right next to chipotle!

rooms are ok. nothing special. 

elevators are quick. 

tables are relatively low priced!

i will come back because the rooms are cheap!!!! totalrewards!For a cheap hotel located in the CENTER of the strip, this is excellent. It's way better than what used to be Imperial Palace (now The Quad), which is located right next to it. Rooms are standard and spacious. Be aware though, they don't really clean the rooms thoroughly - the cabinets in our room were sticky when we came in. Yuck. Anyways, room service is friendly and were always speedy when we asked for more towels. The hotel itself did not smell like smoke which was a plus. We stayed in Carnaval tower so I can't be the judge for anywhere else. 

You're able to check out from the TV which is an interesting feature. I don't stay in hotels often so sorry if this is old news. It wasn't working in our room though. 

Parking here isn't that great. It's actually kind of hard to find! Located in the back!Dated but still somewhat fun.

This is probably still one of the best places to abandon your kids while you gamble irresponsibly.

Had a chili cheeseburger at one of the cafe/restaurants. It wasn't bad.When in Vegas, one expects to spend more...just part of the experience...Circa serves a nice, Caprese salad...thick slices of both tomato and mozzarella di buffala, but pretty hard to mess up.

The Chilean Sea Bass special was excellently prepared (appropriate size portion - very moist, sweet, and delicious), but not certain, even for Vegas, that it rates a $45 price tag.

Courteous, friendly service at the bar by Curtis, a true professional.for the dozen or so times i've been to vegas this is literally the FIRST TIME i have ever seen the monorail running. i couldn't believe it. my boss and i were wary of riding it because of its always breaking down, tipiing over?! repuatation.
but it runs from the very north end of the strip (the last stop is the sahara) all the way to the MGM. since were staying at the hilton (the second to last southbound stop) and attending shows at MGM, we decided it ws going to be most definitely cheaper and probably faster than waiting for cabs and getting stuck in strip traffic. 
it's $5 for one ride, $9 for two rides (which can be shared between two people), $40 for all access, 3 day pass or -the best deal- $9 for an unlimited ride 24-hour pass. we purchased three 24-hour passes and for as much as we went from our hotel, to the mgm, to the convention center, to other random hotels for lunch breaks and what not, we saved -im not kidding- hundreds in cab fares and by god, you do enough walking in vegas without treking from one hotel to the next six times a day.
each hotel on the line (about 7) has a station where a train arrives every 7 minutes, and day or night, it was never too crowded to comfortably ride. i will totally do this (if it's an option) every time i go to vegas from now on.DEFINITELY overrated. Although I'm happy that I had the opportunity to stay at this highly rated hotel, I will never stay there ever again, nor recommend it to my friends, unless they'd like to golf at their $500/day course.  

I would give the check-in service and spa treatments, amenities and employees 5 stars. The room view was excellent.  Other than that, I would not stay at this hotel again because the service was so substandard, in comparison to the Venetian and Bellagio.

We dined at three of the restaurants and service was substandard--took the waiters more than 10 minutes to even greet us and it took more than 1/2 hour to get our meals, plus no apologies for the delays.  The buffet was excellent, but service was slow with refills on water and sodas.

Our room walls were quite thin, and we could hear the voices of the people next door. Also, in the bathroom, you could clearly hear the guest next door on the phone (kinda scary trying to figure out where the voice was coming from).  We could hear other hotel room doors open and close, so it was hard to tell whether someone was entering our room.   

The bathroom wasn't well stocked with paper products--we actually ran out of toilet tissue and kleenex the first day, and this has never happened at any hotel I've ever stayed at before--even 3 star hotels.  There was no ventilation fan in the bathroom either. Also, there was a green cleaning glove left behind on the bathroom counter (GROSS) our second day.

On our third day, I had a pillowcase that had dried blood marks on it (REALLY GROSS)  which really made me want to check out and check into the Venetian.

To top it off, we had family staying on the strip who had planned to have dinner with us.  They have three children, two asleep in strollers, utitilized valet, entered the hotel and were met by security, who denied them entry into the hotel because they were not registered hotel guests and were told that ONLY registered hotel guests were allowed strollers in the hotel.  Security didn't seem to care that the children were asleep, valet had just parked their car, and they were joining us for dinner.  They said that this was simply hotel policy. This I felt to be absolutely ludicrous, if not discriminatory.

So those of you with children in strollers who plan to shop, dine or peruse the Wynn and are NOT registered guests, security will "greet" you, then will not allow you entry.

We requested a rollaway, but the charge was $50 extra per day.  I've stayed at the Bellagio, Venetian, MGM and have never been charged extra for a rollaway.  I hadn't expected this, especially when I was already paying quite a bit for the room and the beds were only double beds, not queen.

Elevators were really slow, and I heard others commenting that most of the time, only half of the elevators were working.

I had really high expectations of this hotel because of all the hype and the 5 diamond status.  I was so very disappointed.  I can't wait to book at the Bellagio or Venetian again, where I've never been disappointed and would rate them over and above the Wynn any day.  

I'll be definitely writing to management about this experience.Steak special is good and the beer is great. The steak will be not the best cut but for $7.99 who can complain. The beer is why we go here. 22oz for $1.75 made in the on site brewery. Plenty of entertainment at the center bar. The clientele is shady so always fun to watch.Ellis Island has a small cafe that had great steak specials.   The only problems are that there usually is a wait and the service is slower than molasses but I still come here. 

Food: steak and eggs for 5.99? Sure!  This isn't any angus beef rated steak but for the amount of money, why not eat it?  If you like your steak a little rare inside or even medium rare, ask for rare.  Why?  They cook it two ways, well done or rare.  The rare is a little pink inside and the medium rare is where their well done starts.  Not because they don't know how to cook, just because the steak is so thin.   The Sides it comes with is usually pretty decent too.

Service:  The service is SLOW.  I mean SUPER SLOW.  If you were waiting for your steak to cook on the sidewalk outside during the hottest day of summer in Vegas, you'd probably have a steak sooner than in this place.  They wait staff has a lot of tables to serve and they're also under staffed.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing.  This place is great to chill with friends while waiting for your cheap food.  It's just a thing to note if you're in a rush.

Overall, great prices for decent food and slow service.  It's vegas and it's off the strip, what do you want?  

I'd go back.I've stayed here twice.  I got great deals both times.  Once was for a convention held here, which is why I picked it (along with the price). The other was for a ski trip.  (yes Vegas has small ski resorts 1to2 hours away.). The casino itself sucks and is small.  The only good place to eat is at Queen Victoria Pub.  The other places are bad.  It Is 3to5 minute walk to the Encore / Wynn which is where I ate and hung out at night when I stayed here. Don't take your wife or girlfriend here, but not a bad place to stay if you are on a budget.I enjoyed my stay here and really enjoyed the Desert Passage shopping as well.  No problem getting a late checkout (key when you don't get to your room until 6am).  Clean room but the bathroom had NO water pressure which is awful.  There's a lot to do without having to leave the casino proper and quite a few clubs to frequent as well.  It also was relatively inexpensive given that there were a few of us staying in the room together.  It's not the best hotel I've ever stayed in but it's certainly not the worst.My friends and I were walking along the strip when we overheard some guys talking about Fatburger. One of the guys mentioned a fried egg that they on your burger, so we were determined to try it at that moment! When we finally arrived at Fatburger, we were hesitant about entering cause it looked kinda shady, but we finally built up the courage. 

Their menu doesn't really offer much to choose from. The only unique option that they have is the fried egg. I had the medium burger with skinny fries. I opted out of the fried egg since it didn't seem appealing to me anymore. The burger wasn't bad, but it seemed like a poor In-N-Out imitation. The skinny fries were crispy even though we walked all the way back to our hotel room before gorging. Overall, it was decent and cheap. I'd definitely choose Fatburger over the McDonalds next door though.Im not into paying that much for a cup just because it has a red m&m pic on it, sorry, but it is a must see store of the strip IMO.. it has 4 floors of ALL M&M, and on 1 floor theres even a mini attraction (go see)This place is hard to review. The prices are really high, and even if you just go in to buy the candy itself (skipping all of the souvenirs and the like), you'll likely end up paying somewhere in the neighborhood of $12.99 for a single pound (depending on whether or not you choose to fill your own bag, or purchase a pre-wrapped option).

Still, there are TONS of items here for the M&M fanatic - penny crushing machines on almost every floor (I'm a nut for these things, and they only cost $0.51) and some items are technically on clearance, bringing their prices down into the fairly reasonable range.

However, for all of the variety in the store, the prices are simply outrageous. $8 for a plastic keychain with glued on gemstones that had already fallen off some of the ones hanging on the rack? Really disappointing.

I'm a huge fan of little trinkets - keychains, magnets, anything that lights up or has moving parts (very easily amused in that way). This place has a lot of stuff that fits the bill, even if you're just into stuff that's really colorful, but you'll need to be prepared to pay at least $20 if you want something worthwhile (that's $20 for one item - and that's a low guesstimate). Unfortunately, I walked out with just a couple of squished pennies.Yes, this is a very cool place.  Lots to choose from if you are a chocoholic.  There was some construction going on inside when we arrived and they blocked off one of the floors.
Service is excellent.  They are very quick to assist you and help you find anything.  And they usually have the M&M person dressed up upon entry to greet you or dance with you.
Only issue, as with many others, is that they charge literally thirteen dollars a pound for this stuff.  And everything else is overpriced as well.  They have a ton of cute items to buy and eat, but when you realize that they are just the same M&M's you buy anywhere else, just wrapped up in fancy packages, you come to your senses and you walk out with a minimum amount.  But it is Vegas after all.
Great place.  But very easy to spend a lot, especially if you have kids.My husband chose this restaurant for my birthday, as we were also going to attend Terry Fator.  The restaurant is not exactly with the other restaurants, but off to the right of the entrance to the Mirage - maybe there is more in that direction but we did not venture that direction.   There was not many people there at our 6pm reservation and right after our server introduced herself, she was replaced by 2 others who told us she was sent home because it was slow...you order everything separate and the servers were nice to say they were big enough for two - the price sure was!!  I ordered a wedge starter and it came out split into two plates - awesome!  My husband ordered some sort of steak and they butterflied it - he likes it well and well, it looked it to me!  He said it was good, but not all that.  I got the Maine Lobster, which they did take off the shell and it was good.  We also had a side of roasted carrots that were good, too.  At the end, they brought out a birthday dessert and it looked like ice cream, but was cheesecake - it was really good.  Overall, the service was really good, but I felt like the prices were too high.  This is by far not the most expensive place we have eaten, which is why I think the food/experience fell short for the price.  I might consider coming back to order drinks and starters, as they sounded good, but not dinner.I think the food OK here.  I don't think I got a great cut on my steak.

Bone in Prime Rib Eye 22oz - $56 - Average 3/5
The prime rib was OK.  I didn't enjoy the cut of the steak.  The inside was cooked perfectly but the cut wasn't anything special.  Unfortunately the steak tasted a bit standard.  My friends steaks, on the other hand, came out much better.

NOTE - 
My friend tried this same restaurant in NY he warned us they tend to under-cook the steak.  For example, a medium will probably come out medium-rare, a medium rare will come out rare, etc.  The same incident happened here as well; 2 members in our party ordered steaks medium and medium-rare, and both were under-cooked and came out medium rare and rare, respectively.  As such, both members in my party had to have their steaks re-heated.  Not a big deal but something to keep in mind.

Old Fashioned - $14 - Decent 3.5/5
I requested the old fashioned have a scorched twist.  The old fashioned was decent; it didn't come out sweet which is how I like it.  Unfortunately, I didn't think our server knew much about the drink.  The old fashioned came w/ a straw (usually it doesn't).  When my drink came the server scorched the twist right in front of me.  I found it odd the server scorched the twist (shouldn't this have been done by the bartender??), also she didn't scorch the twist properly.  The twist is supposed to be rubbed on the rim of the drink afterward (which it wasn't).

Complimentary bread- 
Sesame bread.  Really good & soft.  Yummy 4/5.

Appetizers
Lobster Mac n Cheese -Decent 3/5.5
Mushrooms Sauted - Decent, 3.5/5
Potatoes au Gratin - Best, 4/5

TIPS:
-Corkage $50 (yikes)
- steaks have been known to come out under-cooked (which is detailed above)standard business hotel...needs more selection of clothing and shoes.Let's start off by saying that I had little to no expectations of the food quality. I was just taking my family there for my little monkey's 4th birthday dinner. I knew he would love the ambiance...turns out I was right. If you go with that in mind then you will have a great time. 

We went on a Tuesday night and luckily we were smart enough to make a reservation (I think there was about an hour wait). We were taken right in and seated next to one of the huge aquariums. My kids were in awe of the fish and the gorilla beating his chest in the corner. Our server came around and we ordered. The service was a bit on the slow side but I observed he was quadruple sat (for those of you who aren't educated in the service industry....quadruple sat means the server was sat 4 times all at once...that's tough for even the most amazing of servers)..so it was absolutely forgivable (been there...done that). Our food was just so so and overpriced (but what isn't on the Strip?)...but what made it all worth it was the screams of joy from my monkeys. We will definitely be back here for their family birthday dinners.A family member recommended Lawry's the last time we were in Vegas; we finally got to try it out this time. Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed. The food was alright. Prices were of course on the higher side bc of prime rib but still pretty reasonable. Service was a bit odd... I can't quite explain it. The decor's pretty old-fashioned. Lawry's is about 2 mi away from the Strip. 

You choose the size of prime rib & they carve it table-side, which was pretty neat. Salad, mashed potatoes, & yorkshire pudding come with your prime rib order. The prime rib was good; everything else tasted just ok.I was on the road toward Vegas, in need of a place to stay, so I did what any plan-lacking, impromptus guy would do. I stopped at the most convenient Starbuck, got on my favorite travel site (epicure.rovia.com), and located the cheapest, but nicest, hotel I could find. According to the price, the pics., and the map, the Tuscany is one I opted for.

So here's the turnout: $14.00 for two beer and $28.00 for the room.

As you drive in, there is a good impression made by the design, the overbuilt portico and the bell boy standing out front. The lobby supported the first impression, and even the bar and the pool area indicated that the rooms just might be equipped with jetted tubs and a wet bar. This was not so. The room was bigger than your standard hotel room, included a sofa, and the bed was nice, but I wasn't going to be soaking in a Jacuzzi, or sipping a Pina Colada. 

I began wondering how they stay in business when they charge only $28.00 per night. It wasn't until after I slid under the covers, my head hit the pillow, and I closed my eyes that I understood. Then commenced the rumbling of footsteps and wheeled suitcases just outside the door. Every 15 or 20 minute I was startled awake by some late-night gambler returning to his room, or a red-eye checking in for the night.

Needless to say, I was robbed of my slumber, and I regretted going cheap. Next time, I'll put my beer money toward a better room, and go without the drinks.Not my favorite Barnes & Noble. This one has a nice selection of DVD's and CD's, a big toy area, a big Starbucks area.. But not much room for the actual books, which is where the problem lies. I never find anything here. I've been several times and always leave empty handed. The scifi, manga, and general comic section are itsy bitsy, and have no selection. Since I'm nerd, this just does NOT work for me. 
However, the store is clean, the employees friendly, and if I were looking for CD's, DVD's, or toys, I'd definitely be back, so I can't really bear to give it 2 stars..This place right down the street from a relative's place so we visited this place yesterday.  

The food came quickly and the staff was friendly.  I got away with a large "Bobbie" -- THANKSGIVING in a roll.  I haven't had this in a while and it is just as good as I remember it.  The bobby has turkey, stuffing and cranberry!

I've frequented this particular location in the past, probably about 8 years ago.  Parking is a little tight at this location in my opinion.

I would still prefer to drive the little extra distance to the location by my work by the area of Tropicana and Fort Apache or by my home by the area of Town Center & Summerlin Parkway.Here is a place close to the house that we frequent more when the weather is warmer. They have a nice area outside to sit and relax. The food is decent enough but not all that special. There isn't a large menu but there is a bit of seafood or steak if that is your desire. The burgers are big and you can replace your fries with a nice chopped salad. The drinks are priced well below places like Applebee's or Chili's so enjoy one with your meal. Would I rave about this place? Clearly not but it is not like a dive bar so you can bring a lady without worry. Check it out and then come back and correct this review if you feel it is in error. You won't change my opinion but maybe someone else's and good luck  wit dat!!Once upon a time Chi-Chi's had the Seafood Enchilada, it had a creamy sherry sauce.  Well, when the better half and I stopped into Border Grill during a trip to MMS they had a Seafood Enchilada with a creamy sherry sauce.

I hoped against hope that it was the same thing.

Unfortunately it was 35 dollars. And it wasn't the same.

I grant you this is entirely my expectations vs. reality.  But because it wasn't what I wanted it to be, I didn't really care for it. So it felt like 35 dollars wasted.  The better half got the Quesadillas which WERE really good. So she was happy.

My other frustration is the Las Vegas Mexican restaurant trick of asking if you want "Fresh Guacamole". This is code for "Would you like to pay 9 more dollars?"  They rarely inform you it's an extra cost and they ask so nicely. Don't be fooled.  Fortunately I knew from a previous bad experience.

The chips and salsa were very good, and our waiter was excellent.  When I explained the Chi-Chis story he said "What's Chi-Chi's".  (Now I feel old!)

Overall, I can't say it was bad, and as long as you don't mind the somewhat high cost of the Mexican food. I would absolutely come back for the QuesadillasThis place is owned by Koreans so don't expect authentice Japanese sushi. The best option is to get the AYCE sushi. The lunch price is around 17 and 23 for dinner. You have to eat all the rice. Most of the sushi was either deep fried or was covered in sauce. They do have a large selection of rolls, although they do seem like a variation of the same thing.**** 2.5 stars ****

I feel somewhat obligated to point out right away that this place is somewhere that should be reserved primarily for locals, or more accurately those with cars here, because while you might be able to find a cabbie to bring you here getting one to take you home will likely be an ordeal, in our case about an hour wait with nothing really nearby. Yes, it is $23 for AYCE sushi for dinner, but there were multiple times throughout the meal that I found myself wondering "why am I eating this in the middle of the desert?" Freshness is definitely suspect here...

For the price alone this place obviously garners some well deserved attention. It's amazing that you can sit here for 2 hours during dinner, ordering as much as you can possibly fit in, and walk away paying about $30 after tax and tip. There are some items with restricted limits of one per customer, such as the uni, hamachi kama, and a few of the rolls, but my experience with those items was that you should probably skip them anyway. Stick to the rolls with the overt (re: corny) sexual references in the titles, since they're drowned in enough sauces to make the lack of fresh fish not so noticeable.

After waiting about 45 minutes for a table (with a brief trip to Albertson's on the corner for some 40's to sip on while we passed the time) we all began with some miso soup which was actually quite nice, and seeing as how we were about halfway into the "burned out" stage of our trip it was a refreshing interlude. Tea was served on the side in mugs so searing hot that none of my dining companions were able to lift the glasses. The little lady who dropped it off must have fingers that are numb to it at this point. We all ordered just one roll each initially, just to get an idea of the portion sizes and see what items they do best. I started with the Snow In Vegas, a spicy crab, spicy tuna, and avocado roll with red snapper, eel sauce, and sweet yam sauce on top. I ordered this based on the multiple mentions here and it was my favorite item of the evening, for sure.

The next round I was forced to play into their awkward sexual inferences and ask my waitress for a Palm Job, which unfortunately isn't as alluring as it sounds, since the spicy soft-shell crab and scallop wrapped in soy paper with a "crunch" just feels a bit grainy, and, to use their analogy, limp. The flavors were nice, but texturally it's an amateur job, certainly not high class. I went for the hamachi kama (fish collarbone) as a brief respite from the rolls, to some shock from my less adventurous onlookers. It was cooked mostly alright, but definitely a bit dry, and the dipping sauce on the side tasted almost exclusively of soy sauce. Eating really dry, flaky kama with chopsticks is quite a pain in the ass to be honest, so stay away from this item even if it's one of your favorite indulgences, as it is mine.

Even though I was nowhere near full everyone else was pretty much ready to go at this point, not quite up to the gastrointestinal challenges I regularly put myself through. So, I foolishly wrapped up the meal with what essentially equated to most of my negative impression, an order each of giant clam and uni (sea urchin). The giant clam was essentially just thin strips of rubber and the uni looked more like children's toothpaste than anything edible from the sea. My instinct told me not to consume these items, but I of course ignored it, and luckily I didn't get sick. The taste of each was awful, along with the texture, and only amplified when a few weeks later I had exemplary versions of both as part of the omakase menu at Sushi Ota in San Diego, perhaps the freshest I've ever eaten.

After wrapping up the meal we asked the hostess to call us a taxi van while we knocked out our dessert items. Nearly 45 minutes of waiting outside later I decided to just phone another cab company myself and they showed up within the next 15 minutes or so. I'm not really knocking Yama for being located where they are, since we are the ones who chose to go there, but you should be aware of the difficulty you'll have getting back if you don't have your own reliable mode of transportation.For starters, we LOVE Rumrunner. No shit, we come here at least three time a month and have for years. We even have a text code for it: My phone is riddled with texts that say "RR later?" or "at RR". I hate to think how much we've spent at RR... Thousands of dollars over the years for sure. We know the staff, the costumers and the dregulars© in the parking lot. 

RR is one of those bars that has an attached restaurant (The Badger Cafe) that servers the food to the bar customers. Think Moondoogies, Money Plays, Inn Zone and Putters. The food coming out of Badger Cafe is some of the best bar food in Las Vegas and cheap! The Burger is the star, only Dispensary Lounge and Blue Ox are better. The cheese curds, the tacos and the daily specials are also all great.

Don't expect to have a great experience EVERY time. The food service can be spotty to terrible. We have had to stop at Roberto's on the way home from time to time. 

Also RR can get pretty Ghetto on weekend nights. I guess it is a pool hall.


All in all, 90% of the time Rumrunner rules!Fun bar my local Vegas friends took me to away from the Strip. It was great to go away from the hustle, bustle and tourism and come here. I didn't hear a lick of British while I was here though. Maybe next time.

Service was unbearably slow, although my friends assured me this usually isn't the case so I'll take their word for it.

For both food and beer, the portions are giant. You definitely get your money's worth. I liked the variety of British food, but just wanted some chicken wings. Like I said, huge portion size and number. I had a good 8-9 wings. I was a little disappointed that the sauce came on the side, although it was just hot sauce (and also ranch).

The crowd was lively for a Thursday night, although the television audio wasn't on (because it was college basketball?)I was hoping Cuba Cafe would be a knock-out because it is so close to home, but it came in at just A-OK after my husband and I made a special trip here to use a Restaurant.com coupon I've been holding onto for awhile now. 

In the past I have not had a lot of experience with Cuban food save for the couple times I have been to Havana Grill (which is in Henderson). The couple times I had had it I really enjoyed it, and was hoping Cuba Cafe would produce some of those same feelings. 

Let's start with the fact that the place could use a serious face lift. When we walked in I thought we had entered an Elks Lodge dining area. Have any of you out there been in an Elks Lodge with a dining area and a bar? Do you KNOW what I'm talking about? Anyway, besides the Elks Lodge feel it is also very PURPLE... purple walls, purple table clothes, purple curtains... man, I haven't seen that much purple in a long time. So the ambiance is less than appealing. How about service?

There were two people manning the floor - what appeared to be the waitress/hostess and a busser. However, the busser handled the majority of the tables. He brought our drinks, refilled our drinks, brought our food, asked us how everything was, cleared our plates. The only thing he did not do was to take our order and deliver the check. I couldn't decide who our actual server was, but the girl waitress/hostess wasn't very congenial, except for when I asked for our fried plantains to be brought out before the other food...

Speaking of food. We ordered the fried plantains as our appetizer. My husband described them as "Tasting like an onion ring on the outside and not-ripe-enough banana on the inside". He was right. The plantains were not what I was hoping for. As for main dishes I got the bistec sandwich, which is a piece of flat steak pressed with tomato, lettuce, and little potatolings that are fried with a sauce of sorts. This was a pretty good sandwich, but I wish the steak had not been as chewy/sinewy as it was. My husband, who wasn't into the whole "Cuban food" idea ordered the chicken sandwich, which was basically exactly like my bistec.

Our other side was french fries and they are nice a fat, crispy, none of them were soggy, actually quite enjoyable.

Overall with the purple dining experience and the not-so-amazing food I have to go with 3 stars. The place isn't bad and maybe I should have ordered something else, perhaps the "ropa" meat dish everyone exclaims about, but I wasn't hungry enough for a full plate. This place is so close to home I am not going to say I won't be back, but I don't think it was good enough to have me running back for seconds right away.Excellent food and service.  The drinks are a ripoff.  Do cocktails elsewhere!!Not a bad little Thai restaurant.  Considering the area, there aren't a lot of choices here, so this one isn't a bad choice if you live in the area.  I decided to stop by here after a short visit to Khoury's.  I ordered the crab rangoon, and the green curry with beef.

I wasn't that impressed with the crab rangoon.  It was over priced, and just not that good.  I liked the cream cheese filling ok, with it's herbs.  The shell however was that store-bought, thin, almost candy like shell.  The sweet and sour was pretty standard as well.  I'd recommend skipping on this particular appetizer.

The green curry was a little better.  It was made from the typical canned stuff, along with an herb or two that made it a little unique.  It had some sweetness added to it even though I ordered it without extra sweetness (I don't know if they held back or not on the added sugar).  The dish was served with the standard bamboo, zucchini, and a red and green pepper or two.  The best part of the dish was the beef though.  It was nice and tender, and really easy to chew.  I quite enjoyed it!

They had live music on a Wednesday night, which was cool.  Just some older fellow with a guitar, but that is better than no live music!  The service was a bit slow, but they were quite busy for a Wednesday night.  There are a few interesting dishes on the menu that I wish I would have ordered instead of the curry.  I might return if I am in the area to try some different stuff.Love the food here!!! Chips and salsa with bean dip... AWESOME!!! I agree with the consensus that they have slow serving but always very friendly!!! I like that they have a person walking around doing pictures for guests... Nice touch!!! Great finish to the meal was the Pina Colada served in a fresh Pineapple!!! DELICIOUS!!!I was told there's an amazing sushi all-you-can-eat restaurant off the strip in Las Vegas and I did my first visit in Feb 2009. That was such an awesome experience. Came in around 12pm and ordered lots of half-order baked rolls and fancy sushi. The raw fish, esp. the yellowtail, was very fresh. The strawberry mochi was also very impressive as a dessert. 
Based on my previous experience, I gave it a second try last week during lunch time. However I found that there must be something different... I can tell the sushi was made differently, although all the chefs were the same. When I pick up the sushi, the rice fell apart easily. I was not sure if it's because the chef did not make the roll correctly, or the rice was not made for sushi at all. But with the price they charge, it is not supposed to happen (especially it's made by Japanese chefs!). The chef lapsed our order several times even when we were sitting at the sushi bar. Even if the raw fish was still fresh, I was feeling so different that I have to gave it only 3-start this time. 
C'mon sushi mon, you fish deserves 5-star, what happened to your sushi rice??It's a Krispy Kreme. Pretty large and only great when their doughnut light is on. When it is, you get a free doughnut! Otherwise these doughnuts are pretty terrible. But fresh they're awesome.

Place closes at 2200 and I came at 2100 on a Wednesday night and they were making new doughnuts! I was told this place is the main Krispy Kreme for Vegas so they possibly make doughnuts all night so that early morning they can get shipped out to the various stores that sell them.Not bad for if you're looking for some quick take out. Nothing good or bad to say. Just your standard strip mall take out place.It is scary when they know what you're going to order as soon as you walk in? Yes, I've been here more than a few timesOur whole party hasn't arrived yet and when we mentioned that to the hostess, she kind of just told us to go on the side. It would've been fine if she said it politely.

We finally got seated and the server seemed very flustered with taking our orders by we were a large group. The food took foreeeeever and the server was rarely at our table. Didn't understand it because it wasnt that busy at the restaurant.

The food was yummy though. I ordered the Chicken BBQ Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries.I have ate at Mark Rich's numerous times, due to the fact that I lived across the street and used to work next door. If you are eating in or picking up and planning on not traveling far before you eat, the food is great. However, there is something that doesnt work out when delivering or picking up and having a more than 3 minute drive home. If you get something breaded, it get soggy. There have been a few times where we have had pizza delivered and had to reheat it. If you chose to eat here, make sure you eat inside the first time so you dont get a bad taste afterwards and not want to go back. Aside from the food, they always have very courteous employees.Oh, BOB. Oh, I am sorry Chase.....No no no....its BOB. Yep. Sorry transplants, its BOB. Oh and the team that plays here 81 days out of the year, they used to wear purple and green.....and OH, was it glorious....just like when this place first opened. With that said, lets hit a home run and talk about BOB-er...Chase Field.

~What to Do~
Watching baseball comes to mind :-D They hold some events sparsely throughout the year, so lets look at this place objectively with this in mind. 

~The Good~
There are some highlights. The one thing that comes to mind is that a good 70% of seats here at chase are close enough to the game that you do not have to squint. They did an awesome job, the design is in line with most new stadiums, giving the fan the closest possible experience to the field. For children, they have a village-like are in the upper left side of the stadium for them to run around at. There of course is the pool, but I have yet to step foot there, the bulk of Arizonan's for that matter have never swam their. They have a number of vendor locations and you are never far away from a bathroom, which is very nice. Finally, before the bad, I must say that parking around the stadium is extremely cheap, and many many free spots are free if you are frugal like me...DO NOT fall prey to huge prices, when you simply can walk 5-10 minutes for free.

~The Bad~
Well, why do we give this hulk in central Phoenix 3 stars? I mean, you are born and raised here, you should appreciate it! Well, let me say, when you have been to IMO the mecca of sports stadiums, Camden Yards (home of my beloved Orioles), you have a different view on all other stadiums. First, the stadium is simply here to service games, there really is no extracurricular activities available in the stadium. You go to the game, sit down, then get up and leave. They used to have a sports exhibit in Center field, that closed down. So, there really is no extra-special experience. The stadium design itself, although impressive, reminds you of a steel entrapment. The roof opening is cool, yes, but other stadiums worldwide have it too, it is no longer exclusive to us. There are no beautiful views, its completely enclosed. This makes the stadium just average. It is mechanically a sound strong stadium, without any specific factor which gives it pizazz. 

~The Down Low~
I am born and raised here. I grew up with the stadium. She will be here for many years, she's been built amazingly well. Issue is, there really is no exciting factor about the stadium. No views like Camden Yards, no extra-special old-time feel like Camden Yards...No extra curricular activities to peruse like Camden Yards....You get the point. We are stuck with an average stadium that serves its purpose. It doesn't detract from the game, is suitable for its specified purpose, and is a sound park to watch a game. If you are in town, go to a game, it will be fun....but do not expect to be wowed if you have been to one of the classic parks country-wide.Ok.  Let me start by saying that even though I'm a pretty confident guy, I don't consider myself to be "cool" or "hip" in any way.  I wear far too much plaid for that to be the case.  I was looking for a place in the area for a nice chai latte before heading to rehearsals, and this place had the highest / most reviews, figured I had to give it a shot.  I actually went in three different businesses looking for this one, so right off the bat I feel like an idiot.  I ordered my chai, even though I wasn't sure they had it - because there really is no menu displaying what your options are (I'm certain this is in an effort to be cool).  The beverage was ok, nothing special, but ended up costing me almost six bucks.  I will give them this - the ambiance is pretty amazing.  There are many places to sit and chill, lots of nooks and funky chairs, including a pretty cool back patio.  Outside of that, I just felt out of place and uncomfortable - despite the great soundtrack and pretty people.  So - I'm sure if I were cooler, or younger, I'd dig this joint, but it's just not my cup o' tea.Great place to gamble and eat/play at the top of the tower, but bad place to stay at a hotel.Walked down for a break and to see what kind of shape the place was in as stayed here in the past. Looks like it could use another facelift. Service at the bar was very slow and looked like the bartender could care less. Gambled for a short while but the place never gave me a very good feel so we just moved on.This is three stars. I ordered the Mount Fuji dinner and was disappointed. But there is context to this disappointment. I am comparing them against Geisha Japanese Steakhouse on DI and Sandhill.

When asked what came with the Fuji as far as appetizers, I was told soup, salad, two shrimp appetizers, and vegetables. I made the mistake of assuming it was tempura shrimp and vegetables like Geisha. What I got was soup, a pretty good salad, and them I got two pieces of 31-40 shrimp that were cooked on the grill. The vegetables actually came at the end of it all. In between I got the fried rice($3.50!) additional charge. It was egg, rice, and soy sauce?!?!?  Then came the chicken, the three small pieces of lobster and the steak. In fairness the steak portion was pretty good, but the steak was more "Meh" than anything.  With the fried rice the food was almost $47.50!

For contrast, at Geisha you get the soup and salad. You get to choose an appetizer from their appetizer menu, which I normally get shrimp and vegi tempura. Then you get vegetable fried rice(no up charge), 3-5 pieces of shrimp, chicken, lobster, steak, and stir fried vegetables. On top of that you get soda or sake, or possibly another drink. I believe they are charging $35.95 for this, which is called the Geisha special. 

In this context, this Osaka meal should get a 2, but I am giving it a 3, because price aside it really is deserving of a three. If you go to their website via the yelp app, there is a coupon for $20 off over $100, and a couple of others. 

Geisha is the benchmark, and while it is on the other side of town, it is worth the drive. It also looks like a hole in the wall and it is. Some of the best food comes from places described as a hole in the wall. 

I do however still like this Osaka for their lunch bento boxes.Our waiter was creepy. But otherwise, this was a satisfying experience albeit overpriced. 

We came here for brunch. To start, we had the "fondue" and soup special of the day. Fondue is a misnomer for this dish. It was more like crackers with an avocado relish and a cheese dip. But it was completely delicious; I scarfed down every last crumb.

For the main dish, I ordered the mixed seafood dish and my boyfriend got the steak sandwich. The seafood dish was almost like a paella -- fish mixed with shrimp and clams and mussels in a risotto-like rice. Thankfully, the flavors weren't overwhelmingly fishy. The steak sandwich is served cold with a warm au jus accompaniment. It was good but so are the sandwiches you get at the corner deli.

We ended our meal with the banana cream pie. When we ate at the Emeril's in New Orleans several years ago, the pie stood out in my mind so I had to order it again to see if it deserved the pedestal I had placed it on. It did. It was a massive piece of pie with a ton of fresh bananas. THE BEST banana cream pie I have ever had. 

If you're willing to drop some dough on a meal, this is a good option. I  might come back just for the pie.For a place that is supposed to specialize in seafood, the steaks are better choice than the seafood. My sea bass was as plain as can be, you would think it was Tilapia. The gumbo was pretty by the books, nothing special, even a bit under seasoned. Skip the overly priced lobster salad, not much lobster at all. I recommend the rib eye and a side of mash potatoes. Whoever made the french fries here needs to go back to cooking school.
Pretty decent desserts, but all familiar fare, nothing mind blowing.Can't go wrong with meat, buns and any topping you can imagine.  Also, open for late night dining when everything in the Mandalay stops serving food.My hubby suggested that we go to Mesa Grill for lunch since he ate at the restaurant for dinner last year. Apparently, there is a dress code for men for the dining area. No tank tops. Boo. My hubby and I were disappointed that we couldn't have the full dining experience, since we ate at the bar.

I love the appetizer breads. My favorite is the corn muffin. Yum! Since we didn't have breakfast, I was practically full from eating bread. 

I had the Grilled Mahi Mahi with the roasted pineapple chile sauce, carmelized pineapple - green onion salsa and green chile rice ($24). The mahi mahi was overcooked, so I didn't like the dish too much. In addition, the fish wasn't that large. Way overpriced for lunch. At least the sauces were good. 

My hubby ordered the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash with the poached egg and green chile hollaindaise ($18). Yum! This is a very savory dish due to the sweet potato hash. There is some spice to the chicken. I love the presentation of this dish. The texture is a bit mushy due to the shredded chicken and sweet potato. It is like eating baby food. However, the dish is tasty! 

I would try this place again for dinner. Hopefully the portions are larger at dinner.Let me start this review by saying...I'm not a big Tex-Mex fan. So, it obviously wasn't my choice to come here although I'm glad we did. 
My cactus pear margarita was the perfect balance of sweet and booze. 
Apparently, their pisco is amazing too. 
For an appetizer, we went with goat cheese queso fundido. I love cheese so this was fantastic & the goat cheese gave it an extra kick. 
I ordered tuna for my entree. It was alright. The thing to get here is definitely the spice rubbed pork tenderloin. Holy deliciousness! It's spicy so beware. The tamale that came with the pork was cold. Boo.
Our server was great! 
I was satisfied overall (i'm usually satisfied after stuffing my face) but I don't know if I'd come back. Probably only if someone else REALLY wanted to go.Dotty's is a college-y burger place that's right off of state street. This would be a good place to take your parents if they're visiting from out of town.  It's an actual restaurant where you sit down, are waited on, get cutlery and dishes (although it might be just baskets).  Dress is very causal, but you won't stick out if you're not wearing college kid clothes too bad.  

As far the menu, it's like slightly fancy burgers and fries.  

Fancy = more than just ketchup for sauces.  

Burger and fries = lots of burger variations and stuff from the deep fryer.Keep in mind that I'vd been living in New Mexico for the past five and a half years...

Valet parking, a limo pick-up spot and really flippin' fancy schmancy stores. SFS is great if:

a) you're broke but need a little kick in the ass to motivate you to go out and make more money
b) you've been kicked in the ass enough that you're finally making more money and want to show it off
c) you've never had to worry about money because you've got rich parents/relatives etc.

If nothing else, it's worth going to check out all the fancy sports cars zipping around the neighborhood or to watch urban princesses bicker over some triffle to remind you that your own problems really are real and that there are children somewhere out there in the world who don't have any couture at all!Well, it definitely is a shopping mecca! It has unbelievable stores, it's clean, pristine but... almost a little too much. This mall seems sterile, cold and in the 3x I have shopped it over the years, it is never busy. And when you walk down a hallway in a major mall and you are the only person; well, it's creepy and unsettling. 

Do I love all the fabulous, fashionable high end stores? Oh so much! The huge department stores? Definitely. And the large, lovely H&M's, Forever 21's and the like? Amazing! Will I be back? You better believe it! I just hope it grows some ambiance.I had a great time at this hotel!  I stayed here from last Friday to Monday and it was a blast!  Casino is great!  The food is pretty good.  I'd just stay away from the buffet.  It was horrible!  I think it was the worst buffet I've ever had!  One star off for that and another for my last attempt at gambling.  I had already checked out and wanted to throw down a couple hundred on the tables before I left.  But I only had 15 mins before we had to leave.  So I asked a dealer if I could have someone check my bags while I played a couple of hands.  She told me I had to go over there myself and check them in, which would have taken the 15 mins I had to gamble!  Other casinos would have done this, so I'm not sure why the Palms didn't.  Oh well, their loss right?  I probably would lost the money anywayz!  LOL!*************** All that glitters is not gold ************* 

You pass by the fountain watching its spender, wander through the casino, the "O" theater, the retail shops, it all just feels so great. So the lodging experience has to be even better right? 

Nope, keep walking. When do you realize this? It all starts with the check in experience. High brow hotel? High brow service? Nope, get in one of the random lines and pray you will get checked in. No one to direct you to an attendant, no one to organize the guests, just kinda figure out if you are in the "right line". In my opinion, not a good start, but I was still looking forward to relaxing in the room. 

From there, while the room was nicely appointed, once you look past the glitter, it is just a basic room. Mine came with a slow running sink and well used towels. Not my idea of a 5 star hotel. 

Clearly the big plus is the location, but that has a bit of a downside too. I found getting in and out of the hotel parking area was problematic because of the foot traffic on the Blvd. Big glitter, big hotel and I would stop at big disappointment, but clearly a disappointment.Beautiful hotel and super cool water show!If you're going to spending alot of time at the Las Vegas Convention Center, you can't beat the location here. The last thing I waned to do after spending a long day on the show floor was get in a cab. Instead, I had a short 5 min walk back to the hotel.

The room was decent. There was a flat screen tv, but analog service, so the quality was kinda crappy. Other cons -- Internet is $14 a day in the room (but its free in the lobby) and the gym costs extra. However, there is a "jogging path" that goes around the perimeter of the hotel.

The Star Trek bar is amusing -- it was nice that it was always mostly empty since there was always a big group of us. The cabaret show, so so so bad. 

I'd stay here again for Convention related stuff, but for fun I'm going to the strip next time.Spacious rooms, off the strip, you get what you pay for. No frills, bells or whistles. Stayed here for my 30th birthday and we pretty much were out all night and the only time we spent in our hotel room was to nap, basically. Just imagine 5 people crashin' in one room with double beds. 

Party weekend..need I say more?

I'd stay here again.Stayed at the Monte Carlo during EDC 2013. I ended up splitting the room with two friends. The room had two beds, and an extra roll-away bed would cost something like $35-40/night. Something to consider if you're going to need one.

Anyway, the hotel and casino are decent. It's not the fanciest place on the strip, but it definitely isn't a bad place to stay. Everything in the room was clean and functional. Cellular signal was pretty bad in the room, as it is on most of the strip, and WiFi was either not working or not offered. I wasn't the person who booked it, so I can't say for sure.

There's a food court in the restaurant, which is decent if you need something quick and cheap to eat. The Blue Man Group also performs here.

Overall, my stay at the Monte Carlo was pretty enjoyable. If you can book it for a good price, go for it. It's currently undergoing renovation, though it seems like only the entrance from the strip will be improved.ehhh, Monte Carlo is just whatever. The room itself was nice and had a good view but the bathroom needs some updating, especially the fixtures. We stayed here because of the price and location on the strip but thats about all it had going for it. Wish there were better restaurants there as well. Only real issue I had was with the room keys. I had to get new keys 4 times over a 2 day span since they kept on deactivating. That got pretty annoying but I didn't feel like complaining and all that. Wont stay here again unless it is by far the cheapest out of the all the rest of the hotels.I've been dying to see Cirque de Soleil for the longest time, and finally got a chance to. I think I was leaning towards O, but this sounded like an interesting one as well. I cannot say that I was disappointed, because it was great, just not as great as I was expecting O to be. It was about an hour and a half, and there was many scenes, some I liked more than others. My favorite was definitely the rocker dude hanging and swinging by his neck - IT WAS FREAKIN AWESOME! These guys will really pull you up on stage and have you participate. I still question whether some of that stuff is planned ahead of time, but regardless, good show.Circus sex. The purgatory between acrobatics and a sensual topless show. If you like things mixed up crazy and topped off with awkward audience participation then this is your best bet when searching for the Cirque du Soleil show that fits your needs. But, if you are like me and want an adventure that makes you "Ooh and Aww" or (not and) a display that leaves you craving for physical satisfaction then look elsewhere. 

Zumanity just left me feeling confused. 

There are great performances, don't get me wrong.. but each time I felt myself captivated by either the a challenging stunt or a sexual display I was jerked into the opposite direction. It left me unsettled and left me wondering why I couldn't just be left alone! Either give me more extremely awesome hula hooping mid-air or  give me more faux-orgasm aerial silk, but do not give me both!! 

I'm not mad I saw this show, despite the $70 minimum ticket, but I would not ask for a repeat. I recommend watching the trailers for each of the Cirque du Soleil shows available in Vegas and picking which ones seem to suit your personality. I know I pushed my limits with this one and that is exactly what was delivered. If you do like sexy and adventure but not combined, perhaps try another acrobatic show and then follow it up with a purely topless venture. ;)Stayed at the Mirage for a boys weekend and had a really mixed experience. We were in a Tower Suite, apparently one of their biggest/nicest. The room itself did not disappoint. A semi-private elevator, awesome floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the strip and the volcano, a wet bar, cool/contemporary furnishings, a massive master bath & dressing area, and a killer sound system. 

My issues come with the overall level of service. We waited awkwardly for 10 minutes in the valet area for a bellman to get around to checking our bags, which wasn't a great start. Next, even in the "VIP" check in line, we had a 30 minute wait (at 11 AM? Really?), and although we were early and asked to be called when the room was ready, it wasn't until I called several hours later that I was informed we could get into the room. Once we were checked in, things were much better, but we had another long wait at checkout. I guess this is the difference between a 4 & 5 star hotel.

The hotel itself was great. Pro's include a center-strip location and a huge tropical-themed pool with servers to bring you all the tropical frozen drinks your heart desires--though I'd recommend it more for the family set than young & singles. The casino was always lively, the dealers friendly, and while a little slow at times, the dining options were at least available at all price ranges. 

We also spent a full Saturday at the Bare pool/lounge. Check out my separate review, but in a word: awesome.

All in all, if you can survive the lines at check-in/check-out, not a bad place to Stay in Vegas.My last trip to Vegas (July 2013) I got a super discount through M Life for a week at The Mirage (entire 6-day stay was under $400 including the annoying resort fee). I had a slightly better time at the hotel for this trip than I did for my previous trip at TI next door. The casino was much more lively and kinder to me and I fell in love with the NY style deli by the casino entrance. Ate there almost every lunch and a few dinners. Did not fool with the Beatles-themed Cirque show as I had already seen O at the Bellagio and Zumanity at NYNY. Did drink WAY too much one night while playing Let it Ride though LOL. My room was nicer this trip and housekeeping was good to me once again. Food choices were not bad. The Mirage is older and you can tell that when you walk in. It's really taken a beating over the years and the smoke smell in the casino is almost as bad as the MGM's casino. But it's still a good value and still a nice hotel. I'd probably stay there again if the price was right.(Jan/ 2006)

Tuna tartare-- take a back seat (for now), "where's the beef? We shared the steak tartare appetizer and it was good. 

Not remembering that we had dined at Emeril's in Orlando, I ordered Gumbo. And as it turns out, it is the exact same Gumbo that I had at Emeril's restaurant in Florida. Go figure. We also had some fish sitting on a bed of what looked like, well, vomit. BUT nevertheless, the dish was good and the stringy fried potatoes on top were crunchy and tasty.I stayed at the MGM grand for a recent conference, and after hearing a coworker state how much she absolutely hated the MGM Grand, I expected the worst. 

The hotel was booked for the weekend, and I arrived late the night before the conference, so only smoking rooms were available. The smoking room was disgusting and since you can't open windows in Vegas, there was nothing I could do but suffer through the night. I felt awful the next morning. 

However, I went and checked the next morning, and they had a non-smoking room available, so I was able to switch that day. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. I didn't spend much time in the room, so that's really all I needed. The internet access was reliable and though we did lose water for about 5 hours one day due to the ongoing renovation, we were notified in a timely manner, so it wasn't an issue. 

The casino floor was great. As a newbie, I didn't feel too intimidated walking around, and the waitresses were quick to take care of us.

There were tons of dining options (reviewed separately), access to the Monorail and plenty to do.

The conference space was a bit of a pain. It's not really set up for that many attendees (one escalator up and one down for 7000 people with no regular stair options is a bit ridiculous), but the sound and presentation devices were fine. 

I would stay at the MGM Grand again if I were guaranteed a non-smoking room again, though I may wait until the renovation is complete.My friend was staying here over the weekend. I met up with him on sunday and he had me wait in the VIP check-in room while he dropped something off in his room. They had cookies, chocolate covered strawberries, water, soda, beer, and liquor for their VIP guests. I helped myself to a chocolate covered strawberry and a Perrier.

Next we hit up the poker room for a 7pm tourney. They have $50 tournaments @ 11am, 2pm, 7pm, and 10pm. Re-buys during the first hour. 

It was about 10:30pm when my friend won the tourney so we walked over to the 24 hour cafe. We got some egg rolls to start off, which were ok. I had been craving fish tacos but they were not that good.Treasure Island is one of the hotels on the strip that won't exactly "wow" you, but it's still pretty decent and at a great location at a decent price. It's been around for a long time compared to the Venetian and Wynn, and it always features their free pirate shows that play hourly outside. 

Stayed at a standard room. Good view, everything was clean, comfortable bed, and minimalistic modern decor.so my dad had points and he invited me out for a guys night - not bad for free room..

the beds are actually SUPER comfy for a basic two queen room. ..nothing really wrong about the room- your normal wear and tare but pretty well kept. 

yes- it is true what people have said about the credit card- my dad ended up with a 24$ tab and was trying to pay cash and it was automatically charged... we checked out @ the front desk and there wasnt even an option to pay differently so thats the only down side..

the hotel isnt super busy and theres the theatre for special shows, an amazing mexican/tropical themed restaurant and an italian and some shops. pretty nice to stay at and is pretty close to all the other hotels!!Things needed from a hotel in Vegas:
-Bed
-Shower
-Door
-Iron
-Ice machine
Imperial Palace offered all of these things, and for $200 a week to be smack dab in the middle of the strip I find myself liking this place.

That said, there are two issues that really hurt this place - uncomfortable beds and the worst elevators in which I've ever had the pleasure of being consistently froddaged on every excruciatingly long ride. I don't expect much when I'm not paying a ton of money, but I feel that there are basics that every hotel needs to offer.

Will I stay again? Probably, but not if Harrah's or Casino Royale ends up being a cheaper option.Location- Awesome, middle-ish of strip
Price- Amazing for location on the strip, can't find anything in this price range for it.
Staff- The maids were actually pretty awesome, but the staff seemed to just tell you what you wanted to hear without coming through with what they said.
Cleanliness- fare... but the room we got kinda disturbed me.. toilet had red speckles on it and the mirrors were not clean, other then that everything was fine but I had to mention that. (nothing a call to room service wont fix, but little ridiculous.)

More about the staff is when I was checking in we asked for a room facing the strip.. which of course we can't expect to be given just for asking. But the guy working it said yes actually we do but it would have to be the 14th floor in tower 5, which wasn't a problem at all for us.. Though he said it was pointed directly at the strip and warned us their would be a band playing until 3 am every morning.. which wouldn't be a problem with us neither.. But the moment we got to your room we were definitely not facing the strip and were totally faced at Harrah's. Which overall I enjoyed the view of the pool, the Mirage at a odd angle and what was visible of the Venetian. But my main issue is he couldn't just say that it wasn't a strip room... but oh well..Ill just have to be a bit more aggressive our upcoming stay that we have had planned since before we stayed over last week.

Overall: I would stay here again asides from having a room already booked, we had some bs go on, but can't really complain for the location and price... If your looking for fancy this isn't the place...Oh Imperial Palace... cheap place to stay (think model style rooms), great location (center strip), and a casino with relatively low minimums. It excels at its purpose, if that makes any sense. Don't expect a 5 star hotel experience here folks. Your room will be clean, your elevator ride will be slow, and the smell of pot will be everywhere. If you are just looking for a place to crash and don't want to spend big $$$ at the other joints on the strip, IP is a good bet if its under $60 bucks - if over $60 bucks, i would have a hard time justifying paying that amount of money for a room here. 

The casino is old school Vegas - unpretentious, relaxed, and well, fun... Something missing from the big, new fancy megaresorts around the strip. They've got "Dealertainers" - dealers who are also celebrity impersonators - who not only deal the cards, but sing and dance too. Good, fun free entertainment.Knowing exactly what this place is - will help manage your expectations.  It's good, with a very crowded and nice bustling atmosphere.  Very good service and generous wine pours however the food is as expected for a large, strip showcasing restaurant.  We found it  typical chain restaurant fair.    A $45 (or $54, I can't remember) Bone in Rib Eye - was totally sub-par.  Cooked correctly but without aged beef flavor and texture. Lacked serious substance a good steak should have.  Accompanying Bearnaise was light and tasty.  Mussels had great flavor but were teeny tiny and many of the shells were empty.  

Bread was served nicely and was tasty as was the butter.  Pomme Frites were delish and just salty enough.  

As I said, if you manage your expectations, this place will not disappoint.  Fun and touristy but lacking real foodie substance.This is a cute little place located in Paris. You definitely want to take advantage sitting in the patio on a nice, sunny day. It might be a little wait though. We had to wait around 30 minutes. Totally worth it.

The food here is typically priced from around $10-25. I ordered the french onion soup. It was a decent size. My soup had a nice cheesy crust over the top. And they were definitely generous with the cheese. Cheese = happiness. I like that bit a lot. The bread that was under the cheese was a bit too oversaturated with the soup and mushy. It's a personal preference kind of thing, but i really do not like mushy, slimy things. Overall the soup was decent, a bit pricey for a French Onion Soup though, $10. For $10 it could have been better. 

My friend got steak au poivre. I think she ordered it rare, but when I taste tested her food, it seemed more medium rare to medium. I thought the meat was on the tough side. But my friend had no complaints. She moreso loved the flavor of the meat and sauce. The steak was huge too. So i guess she did get her money's worth for a dish that cost $25.95. 

Another friend i was with got the Big Skinny lemon pancakes, or something of the sort. They were thin pancakes, a bit thicker than crepes, slathered with lemon butter and syrup (i think). I had a small bite. It was pretty good. My friend seemed to like it just fine. He still ate all of it despite this being his second meal in the morning. 

Overall, I think this is a cute place to stop buy and have a nice brunch on a pretty, sunny day with friends. The food was okay, in my taste. I wouldn't go so far as to say it was an unforgettable experience. I was not wowwed or anything but It was cute! if sitting on the patio under the sun is your thang, then do your thang at Mon Ami Gabi.The bread was good, warm.  My hubby had the onion soup and I had the scallops which did not look like the photo.  The scallops were cooked well but the veggies were over cooked and they mushed peas to a mash potato consistency (was kind of gross).  One of the waiters poured the water dropping ice all over the place.  Again is was alright.Tried this restaurant for the first time. Service was okay although we did get a little attitude from the hostess who seated us when we did not like the location she led us to.  She then asked if we had a reservation and we said no.  She then proceeded to guide is to a different table which we liked. Food was okay, nothing too special. I ordered a summer tomato salad which never came. I had the classique steak which was delicious and prepared to my liking. We also started with the chicken liver mousse pate which was also delicous. My partner ordered the beef wellington which had to be sent back because he asked for it to be cooked to medium and it was still red so he sent it back. It came out again to his satisfaction. All in all for me it was a been there done that experience.my boyfriend & i went here because we saw it on Anthony Bourdain.  though, i noticed it several times when in vegas.  

we tried:
Tomato Stack (mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, balsamic reduction)
Southern Fried Steak (comes with mashed potatoes & steamed veggies)
Burger with bacon & onion rings

everything was pretty good.  i'd probably stop here again after a late night at a strip club.  they're open 24 hours.After being rejected by the cafe in our hotel, our group came here for some late night grub. The first thing that hits you is the neon lights EVERYWHERE. Purple lights up the ceiling, walls, some of the tables, everywhere. I know it's to play up on the whole Vegas theme, but it can be a bit much. There's some fake flowered trees in between a lot of the tables that overhangs some of the walk ways which was a nice touch, and the bathrooms were roomy and clean.

I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon and fries along with a Blue Hawaiian, and rather than getting an alcoholic drink, it tasted like blue fruit juice (yes, blue is a flavor). Disappointing, but at least the burger was well done. The waiters were a bit difficult to flag down, but they were running around the whole dining floor, so it wasn't a big deal. The only things we needed to ask for was the check - food comas can hit pretty hard after a filling meal when the sun is coming up.

Overall I'd say it's nicer than Denny's and wouldn't mind going back, but it's not a place I'd jump out of my seat to go to. Unless it was 4am and Denny's was the only other option.I don't really understand the hype of this place. The interior is dark and dingy (borderline tacky) and the food isn't all that great.

Usually when you are slightly intoxicated everything tastes GREATTTT, however when I took a bite into my steak it was just meh.

I really don't know what else to say other then I didn't find the food or atmosphere all that special.Keep it simple with your order and be cool to the staff lol

3.5 for the fireplace but not nearly as nice as I remembered but sold place to get your late night or pre-game grub on.

Heck I should just give them 5 stars cuz the fireplace closes the deal every time!!!! Luck be a lady tonight ;)"OK" hotel if you want to stay at a place that is cheap on the strip.I decided to stay at the Luxor a couple of years back. After visiting the property's casino many times on past visits, I decided to try the rooms out, as I usually stay and gamble on the Boulder Highway side of town. As some of the other reviewers have mentioned here, I thought it would be very unique to stay in a Pyramid room, so I gave it a try.  Keep in mind that this property has really done away with a lot of the Egyptian theming and artwork over the past few years, and is moving towards a more modern, hip look.  I kind of liked it better when it was Egyptian.

I'm a member of the players club, but got a much better rate directly on the Luxor's website utilizing one of their offers, which gives anywhere from 5-15% off the going room rate depending on what time you book it. I booked a Pyramid Deluxe Room at a rate of $116 per night, which was not bad for a weekend. Utilizing the offer meant paying for the room in advance, which was no problem.

I arrived at the Front Desk at around 11:30 pm. There was no check-in line whatsoever, but I'm guessing that it was due to the fact that it was almost midnight. The front desk clerk had no problem locating my reservation. However, I had paid for the room in full in advance but she kept saying that my debit card was not charged yet, and it declined when she tried to charge it for the full amount of the room. A couple of minutes later, she arrived with a manager saying there was a mix-up somewhere and that the room had indeed already been paid for. I didn't really appreciate the time she wasted in doing all that.

I was given a room on the second floor, and after locating the elevators, I realized that they had placed me in a East Tower Deluxe room instead of the Pyramid Deluxe room I had booked online. I'm aware that the room types and preferences are not guaranteed when booking on their website, and they classify the Tower rooms as being nicer and bigger than the Pyramid rooms (they actually classified the Tower room as a free upgrade,) but I decided to stay here specifically for the novelty of staying in the Pyramid. Point blank, if I would've known this was going to happen, I probably wouldn't have bothered staying here.

The East Tower room, #2333, although it wasn't what I originally reserved, was very nice. I didn't have any issues with cleanliness, maid service, wear and tear or anything else some of the other reviewers have pointed out. The one thing I did take note of was that I could hear the plumbing from other rooms and it was pretty loud. Whether someone was taking a shower or flushing the toilet, you could definitely hear it - almost louder than being directly in the room it was coming from.

I opted for the high-speed internet connection both nights and it worked flawlessly, along with the entertainment center and all the other amenities the room had to offer. The bathroom contained a separate deep-soaking tub and a glassed in shower stall. Water pressure was very good.

The casino is huge with a large variety of slots and tables. I actually won some money here, which is unusual for being on the Strip, period! Cocktail/beverage service was very rapid.

The only restaurants I visited were LIttle Caesars Pizza and Nathan's Hot Dogs which are both located in the Food Court. Although they've always been great, I did notice they tended to be a bit pricier here than at their standalone stores, but hey, it's Vegas right?

Check-out was flawless, and I received a full refund on the cash incidental deposit I left with them, minus the charges for high-speed internet. They did ask me how everything was, but really didn't have too much to say when I explained that I didn't receive the room type I had originally booked. I did happen to notice that the check-in line was packed, slow moving and almost going out the front door at this time, so I can definitely agree with some other reviewers that it seems to stay very long during peak periods.

Overall, it was an okay stay, and other than the fact that I didn't get the Pyramid Deluxe room and the issue the desk clerk had with billing at check-in, the place was flawless and I'd definitely be back. I've heard that if you book through the Player's Club, you can use the North Entrance to check in, which is probably a big time saver, and also might have a better change of getting the room type you desire. I'll have to look into that on my next trip.  

Just a quick heads up - the spa suites in the Pyramid no longer have spas that are working.  I guess they are too old, and the property decided to discontinue the upkeep.  Some friends recently visited and mentioned that they're now just like regular tubs without jets.  Something to consider, because these rooms were always high-dollar, even when the spas were working!bad service

we reserved two tables (10/8) only to discover when we got there that they had been split up into four. not ideal.
everything came out sooo slow. we had to ask for more bread three times just to stave off the hunger demons that were eating us alive.
we ordered two cheese plates and were served (and charged for) four. boo.

but the food is great. their signature chicken kicks ass, the goat cheese salad and salmon baguette are both predictably delicious. the fries are divine.truly i'd give this a 3.5

definitely not worth the high prices.

food was decent but not very much above average

our table of two ordered steak frites and the trout. we both agreed the trout tasted a bit "fishy". not fresh but fishy.

the steak was better than the fish, but not above average.

ordered an anchor steam beer on draft for only 4.75, but it was only like a 6 or 8 oz glass!Had lunch on a Saturday afternoon at Olives and wasn't impressed.  It's not that the food and drinks was bad, it was just too pricey for what you got.  Make sure you avoid Mojitos here, because at $14 a piece, they were more expensive than each of our lunch entrees.

Perhaps dinner would be better?So and so not as spectacular as the review! My husband thinks the food was good. We had the tasting menu and the Kobe beef charged additionally. I think this place is over priced. For this type of food, I personally prefer Lake House.This reveiw is from Christmas 2012. I came here with daughter, son in law and my dad and stepmom. My Dad and stepmom are not gourmet food lovers at all. My Dad is only happy with steak and baked potato but they were willing to try all the places we had scheduled for this Christmas trip. We had reservations at Gordon Ramsey steak, Le Cirque, Cut, Picasso,  la l'atelier de Joel Robouchon, and Carnevino. 
I don't remember much about the food at this place which is why I am making a real effort to do my reviews  the day of the meal. But it also says the food here wasn't that great because I can remember other places were good. I do remember server was mad when I asked to split the check for my Dad and stepmom on one ticket and us on the other. 
Beautiful place.New look, nicely laid out, easy to navigate.  

There's lots of stores to browse, but I really didn't see a lot of true bargains.  Most merchandise was discounted the same amount as you would find in a regular (non-outlet) shopping mall.  

The weather was great when I went, but I can imagine how miserable a person would be walking around this place in the middle of July.OK... as a frequent hotel guest, I eat here often.  The food is always great, in fact I don't think I've ever been disappointed.  The service however is a very different animal and that's why only 3 stars from me.  One time, you'll get someone who is happy to see you and makes it a good visit, but the next time you get total indifference and sometimes even rude treatment for no apparent reason.

I've eaten here 35-40 times and it's always like that... really good food always, hit or miss service.  In fact, I've decided that the next visit, if I get one of the crappy servers, I'm just going to politiely ask for someone else.

I'm done with the 50% satisfaction rate in the service dept.  I like to eat to someone who's pleasant.  I'm not demanding in any way, just expect a smile. I like to tip well too and it angers me when I get someone who isn't at least friendly.  

I love the Hard Rock Hotel in general.... fun place to unwind!This place has cheap late night eats... but its just okay, nothing special. I think you can get better late night cheap eats at other places. They have a 7-7-7 special that cost $7.77 and it's a piece of steak with a shrimp skewer, mashed potatoes and salad. The salad was DRENCHED in dressing... so the point of disgusting. I could not even eat it!! Literally half the salad plate was dressing, it was like salad tossed in soup. Ask for the dressing on the side!!! I'm warning you!! The steak was cooked properly, the way I wanted it. Shrimp was nothing special and the mashed potatoes tasted like real potatoes. I'm glad I tried it, because now I can see that all the hype is just a hype. I would not go out of my way to eat here.late night dining on a warm winter night is always fun. can't pass a whole lot of judgement as we came closer to closing time. 
i order chicken wings pretty much any chance i can and also had a burger there with jalapeno and guacamole. 

chicken wings wasn't anything above and beyond - but the burger was pretty on point. i like how they flash fry the avocado so that when u bite down it doesn't go sliding out the back end of your burger. nifty little trick.
and aside from the hair in my ketchup - pretty nice place and everything was fairly priced.If you're looking for sake nigiri or teri chicken right here and go eat somewhere else (try the regular dining place a few doors down).  If you're looking for something out of the norm then this is it.  
They have Some dishes really made me go 'wow' while others only got a an 'eh', hence the 3-star rating.  Toro tartare was 'wow'.  Hamachi Wasabi... 'eh'.  The oysters on the day's sampling dish were perfect.  I think we ordered 5 cold plates, 1 hot, and 2 rolls.  While the kabuto roll sounded really yummy it actually was just okay.  The braised kobe beef shortrib was the 2nd best braised shortrib I've had so far (1st being Charlie Palmer's).  The sauce was perfectly salty/sweet/savory.got in free before 12am one wkend - the club is smaller than i expected like the dancefloor which is weird & crowded at times and hot lol theres other VIP rooms but the decor is niceSo I was in New York, New York looking for dinner and my tummy was asking me to feed him Italian. Perfect! New York replica hotel/casino...it's got to have some good Italian spots!? Right!?

Well, I saw this place almost immediately, but wanted to keep looking around to cherish all the options. When I rounded back to this place, there was a long line and a full house! Must be good! So wifey and I jumped in the "hurry up and wait" line. Was it worth the wait? UmMMmM...??? Maybe.

After about 20 mins of tummy rumblings, we were finally seated. First off, the house bread wasn't impressive at all. I ordered the Pennoni Alla Vodka w/ a Crown and Ginger Ale to wash it down. They returned w/ a small almost shot cup sized mixed drink cup ($9.99!?) and a plate of pasta that looks like I could whip it up as a teen home alone on a hungry night. Seriously, if the cups were dogs, my mixed drink cup would have been a miniature pinscher. The pasta actually turned out to be pretty good because the apple smoked bacon and the vodka sauce saved it. Wifey went health nut on me for a change and ordered a "Insalata cesarina"...sounds fancy huh!? Yeah...they could have just put Caesar salad on the dang menu, but I guess they had to spruce it up for the genuine Italian feel. Well, it was a big disappointment...so I ended up sharing my plate w/ her. 

As I mentioned earlier, that this place tries to live up to the Italian feel...well I did here a couple speaking to the waiter and tell him that the food tasted exactly like what is served in Italy! I knew he was legit Italian because the waiter had to have a translator decipher his Italian. I would give this place 2-stars, but being that it satisfied a "real" Italian couple and that many of the other things looked good (as I scanned others' plates while waiting for my food)...I upgraded it to 3-stars. The pizza seemed good because many people ordered it.I was desperate.  It was 6am, I was alone...with no eggs in my fridge and a fierce rumble in the Bronx.

After reading my fellow yelpers glowing reviews, i popped over to Tiffany's to score some breakfast.  Tip:  enter the door closest to the strip...otherwise you're walking through the pharmacy looking lost, desperate and hungry.

Thanks for the heads up on cash-only, yelpers...that would have been awkward.

Service was a-ok, friendly and genuine....and fast.  Food was typical diner food.  I sat at the bar to watch them cook, and didn't see anything horrifying...even if everything is really, REALLY dated.

To my right, a 50-year old woman who would NOT stop staring at me (-1 star for weird patrons), to my left...a booth full of retired Old Vegas mobsters (+ 1 star for awesome patrons).

This place will do in a pinch if you're hungry:  with solid food, good prices, and interesting characters to keep you company.A little disappointed - went for dinner on a Wednesday night and waited about 5 min in line before being seated.  I ate about 4 plates of food and here is what I think:

ENTREE
- kobe sirloin is a bit dry even though it was cooked to medium
- leg of lamb was pretty good and juicy, except the mint jelly was on the counter by the heat lamp so it was more like mint soup
- prime rib (got 2 servings cuz the first cut was rare and the second cut was medium well) -- where is the medium rare cut?
- crab legs - had both king crab and snow crab, nicely cut but a little bit on the salty side - can't complain about crab legs (and it's hard to mess up crab legs sitting on ice)
- had two different fish (one was sea bass) - it was decent
- ahi and salmon poke had good flavor but the fish tasted a bit mushy
- sauteed bakchoy was delicious (i actually ate about 6 or 7 stalks of it) - cooked just right, not too raw and not over cooked, salted just right

sad to say the rest of the entrees didn't really interest me and I skipped the salads

DESSERT
one thing i enjoy most about buffets are their dessert because they come in bite-size portions and a wide variety of selection but nothing I had today was 'to-die-for' - meaning I wouldn't care for seconds.  Don't get me wrong, the stuff was good: creme brulee, flan, little creamed filled waffle cones, mille feuille, ice cream, cookies, fruit tart.  I had them all :)

The last time I came to Bellagio's buffet was back in 2003 on a weekend and it left a lasting memory.  So maybe it was my mind playing tricks on me after 8 years, but it wasn't as good as I had remembered.So much variety here.  Yes, some of the items are low quality "filler" food for buffet but I've found that the carving station and the "medditteranean" station with the kabobs are really good.  The lamb, chicken and beef were delicious.  The seafood station is ok.  The king crab legs were really salty and not really that big.  

Be aware that if you have a party of 6 or larger they automatically charge you gratuity.  We had a large group of 10 so we split 5 and 5 to avoid an additional $50 in gratuity (it was the hostess's suggestion that we did that).First off, let me start by saying that this is the FOURTEENTH, yes, 14th Cirque Du Soleil show that I have seen! I am a HUGE cirque du soleil fan and try to see a different production every chance I get. 

If you are a cirque novice, then I'd say it's a 4 star show... however, after seeing as many productions as I've seen, this one doesn't quite compare to the other ones out there, especially to the other ones in Vegas. The stunts are pretty good, but doesn't have quite the "wow" factor as the others that I have seen. The stunt that was most unique to this production was the sticks where they did the balancing and at one part, jumped from one stick to the other. Another one that really impressed me were the 2 guys that balanced off each other. That takes a lot of skill, coordination, and unbelievable strength!! I also really liked that guy with the cube because it looked so pretty with the light reflecting. 

One thing I did not like about the show was the giant baby... a bit disturbing... and I wasn't quite sure how he fit...

In the end, a good show overall... but not the best. I suggest sitting a little further back because if you sit too close, you will have to lean back to see the tricks in the air. They always offer discounts for this show... so look for them before you buy tickets!! I got mine for only $55, half normal price with cirque promotions. I think many times if you are staying at Treasure Island, the room price can include show tickets as well, but check what promotions are being offered as they change all the time. 

This was the first Cirque show in Vegas, and I'm glad I finally got to see it! The only cirque show I have left to see in Vegas will be the brand new Michael Jackson ONE. 

In my opinion, in Vegas, the best would probably have to be "O" or "Ka". However, since one of the girl performers in Ka fell and died during a performance, I read that the big vertical fight scene was taken out. I have not seen it since they took it out, so I'm not sure how it effects the show now. I thought the tricks they did in Zarkana were more impressive than in Mystere.Mixed emotions.  The first time we went to The Old Fashioned was on a Saturday morning in the Summer.  We enjoyed a bite at one of the tables on the street.  Nice.  My other experience was on a weekday.  We went to get a beer and talk for a bit.  We sat at the bar and waited for 15 minutes with no one acknowledging us.  And it was not dead nor was it really busy.  What made it worse was that there were at least three bartenders and one of them got drinks for a waitress right in front of us!  I do not think that we will return.We have to wait for 20 minutes even though we already made reservations cause the place is super FULL. Their advertisement says "Spiritual Dining" and I don't see anything spiritual about it, in fact, it contradicts to the definition of spiritual. The music is too loud and you have to shout to one another inside the restaurant and you can barely hear the waiter do their recommendation. The food was excellent though, we ordered the 6 different types of seaweed and the Prime Rib with Misoyaki Sauce, both of which is perfect. The decor was okay, it's just a replica of the Tao in New York (and I do prefer the one in NYC). The bathroom is interesting, the ladies go to the Yin bathroom and the gentlemen go to the Yang bathroom, however, the place where you wash your hands and look in the mirror...they are connected and empty on the lower side of the mirror. And they do supply with tons of different types of gums, sweets, moisturizers, toothpicks...etc. I love their chocolate fortune cookies, all the messages inside are exotic...Damn you Jamie mutherffing Foxx!  Your record release party along with PDiddy packed the club to scary fire hazard capacity.  I imagine Vegas does not have any fire codes anywhere because this place surely would have broke all of them.  

First off if you come here, it helps to go with a group of chicks as the 5 girls I was with and I got in pretty damn quick considering there was a line similar to a homeless soup chicken during the depression era.  
Because of the night we went the crowd with Jamie Foxx, the crowd was pretty mixed.  I swear there were a ton of NFL players in the crowd with their entourages and body guards around.  

The clubs two dance floors are nice, except unless you have a VIP area you will surely be bowled over by the girlfriend crews who use the larger one to bowl there way into a *strike* right in the middle of the dance floor by clearing a path.  Apparently from the rest of the reviews from this place, it is always packed to capacity, which means IF YOU CAN'T DANCE, COME HERE, because all you have space to do is Vogue in place.  

The girls going to town on each other in the bathtub and the massage table at the entrance are both nice touches and by touches I mean something for the single guys to oogle with the nonsingle guys something to get the their eyes gouged out for staring.  By the way, I'm not sure how much there were paying those girls because I swear they were pouring ICE into the bathtub in the middle of December and the girls massaging each were REALLY ENJOYING themselves.  I guess when you drop the monetary equivalent to a 1995 Honda Civic on drinks, they can pay the girls a little than the minimum wage.MM, I'll have to go with a "Meh" with a side of A-OK. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either. We were on the guestlist, had tons of trouble getting the boys in for free even though we had an even ratio of guys to girls, finally got in and we couldn't even move through the crowd. I thought Pure was crowded, but dang, Pure's got nothing on Tao. The only dancing I did here was from the swaying and pushing from everyone around me. We stayed less than 2 hours before calling it quits. I want to dance dammit! Not be a human tissue paper for everyone's nasty sweat! Watch the people around you carefully if you don't want to get drinks spilled on you. I don't get people and their "drink-over-the-head" thing. Hey, I'm right here, I know I'm short, but I know you can see me!

On the plus side, I do like the decor of the place, layout's kinda funny, but open bar for ladies before 10pm is always nice and if you decide you want a breath of fresh O2, you can always nudge the bouncer to open up the velvet rope for you to let you dance on the platform. They'll gladly oblige.We got tickets for Dash Berlin and were super excited to check out Tao. We never been to both Tao and Lavo in NYC so this was definitely something we were a little reluctant to do since there are many other nightclubs in the area....

So let's start off from the beginning, the moment we got down from our suites, there was huge lines at 10.30pm!! Luckily the bouncers put us on some VIP lines (maybe he saw us holding our printouts), so we got in in about less than 10minutes. 

The place is really cool, gives you the wow factor. Few bathtubs on your way in, into the the dinner area, there is a huge buddha... and up the stairs, more lounges areas and buddhas.... into the club, that's where the party starts!!

The have a big bar area near the dance area, very CROWDED even at 10.30pm!! Drinks are similar to NY price, so i wasn't surprised. Crowd was weird, i know it's vegas, so most people are wasted when we got there..... and yes i know it's vegas, but does every man needs to hit on you the second your man walked off to the men's room (and vice versa)?? creepy!!! 

Anyways, we were here for Dash Berlin, and he came on around 12:30am-1am.. His entrance was accompanied by a showgirl dancing over the top of the dance floor (yes she was FLYING from one corner to another!!) pretty fun for the drunk crowd! They also give you glow in the dark sticks or something that you can use to hit people who are on your way! Nice touch to the party

Lastly, they have lots of douche bags bouncers, who would not let you take pictures or limit you to 1 picture... lame ass... and the best part of the night is we got our way all the way to the front of the DJ booth and got a superb view of Dash Berlin the rest of the night.... Key word for this place. CROWDED!!!The Hotel is very nice, but as far as great hotels go, this one is good.  I have stayed here twice now and both stays were about the same.

The rooms are spacious, and nice.  I love having the living room, bedroom and extra powder room.  The beds were comfortable, the bathroom is amazing (love the huge tub and shower).

It would have been 4 stars except for the quirkiness!  First stay, the shower didn't drain the first morning and filled up to the top and almost flooded the bathroom, the room safe was already locked when we arrived in the room and we had to call to have it unlocked by the locksmith.  The mini-bar is the old fashioned, need a key style, which we didn't get our key when we checked in (I have a mini-bar thing!), we called, someone brought one up (very nice!)...and the next morning housekeeping took it.  Hmmm.

Second stay, 1/2 of the lights in our room didn't work.  Except for the one's in the closets...which we had to slam the doors shut a few times to get them to go off.

One thing I will say is that I completely understand that hotels have issues and guests will have problems.  However, it's how the hotel deals with the issues that makes all the difference.  They did a great job of that.  The service makes me go back and forth between 3 and 4 stars - but I'm settling on 3 because I think they could do just a little better on the room maintenance/upkeep.I came here memorial weekend with my girlfriend.  I was not too impressed.  I don't know.  Maybe my expectations for the Wynn signature steakhouse were too high.  

First of all, i told them I was vegan when i originally made the reservation, which was a week in advance. I was there a week before but had drinks at Parasol Up/Down and it looked fantastic.  The hostess said that they get a lot of vegan diners all the time and that the kitchen would have no problem accomodating me. 

So we get there and we are nicely seated.  Our server, whom i had to tell i was vegan, had no idea what to serve me.  He kept asking me "what do i want"?  What do you mean what do i want, i was thinking?  He did have the chef come out and talk to me.  He decided to make me a vegan rissotto with peas and carrots with a grilled veggie plate.  

OMG.  This was horrible.  I barely touched the rissotto.  And i LOVE rissotto.  It was just bland, had no flavor and was awful.  The grilled veggies were that.  Grilled veggies.  Not marinated.  Not seasoned.  It was veggies that I coulda bought and held over a gas oven myself.  
The only thing that saved my meal was the Strawberry Funnel Cake.  This was delicious.  Which is the only reason why i gave a review of 3 stars versus 2.  

I know i know.. you're probably thinking, why the hell would my vegan ass go to a steakhouse?  (1) HOT GUYS go to steakhouses and (2) the hostess ranted and raved that they could accomodate me and that they accomodate vegans all the time.  

Um, Yeah... Thanks Steve Wynn, but no thanks!3 1/2 star review. Honestly, I'm disappointed in SW. I was expecting a five-star meal, at a five-star price, and didn't get the meal (but I did get the price).

The biggest complaint is that the steaks and sides seemed overseasoned. Everything was salty. It's too bad, because the quality of the meat was outstanding. And I'm not going to lie, I finished my ribeye as it was tender and good, but the salty taste kind of ruined it for me. My wife did not finish her filet and all of our sides had leftovers. 

I also thought that the service was good but a little overwhelming. Our server kept trying to upsell us on wine and would come around almost too frequently to check on us. He bordered on annoying. 

Combine all that with what was a nearly $500 check for four people (with wine) and I left feeling a little underwhelmed. 

I will say that the ambience at SW is five stars. Just an amazing experience sitting outside on the Lake of Dreams and watching all of the shows that Wynn puts on. If you do decide to dine at SW, ask to sit on the patio.

Also, the bread they serve before dinner is really great. I might walk down there and slip someone a 5 for some of those bacon cheese rolls and pretzel bread. 

Just not sure if I'll have that bread before dinner there again anytime soon.Decent Mexican cuisine with a great looking restaurant. It is located inside the MGM Grand and when we went on a Monday night had no wait, even though it was Memorial day. We ordered the fresh guacamole and a gentleman came to our table and made it right in front of us with ingredients that we wanted. The food was good, but nothing amazing. Would go again if at the MGM.We were pretty excited about seeing O especially after have already see Mystere and Ka.  We had pretty high expectations for this show, and it just didn't live up to them.  We both left the show with a "wasn't nearly as good as we thought it would be" feeling.  This cirque show has a lot more emphasis on water, and of course the staging was done beautifully, however the acrobats were not as good as we expected when comparing to others, like Mystere or Ka.  It seems that most yelpers prefer O to other shows, but we saw Mystere at half the price and would prefer it to O any day of the week!After hearing such  great reviews from everyone and their momma I was expecting awesomeness. Unfortunately I began dozing off  through the show even though I had a raspberry slush to keep me awake. I thought the show was going to be filled with water works with water fountain dancing. Ya not that kind of show at all. Highlights were the clowns and the fire show. At least I get to say I finally got to watch O.The ambiance was outstanding. There were lots of humor in this show, which I really like. I love that the characters get the audience to be involved. The effects were pretty good as well. Tickets were about $160 each. I would look for a bargain.. (coke Bottle) if you want to see this show. I don't want to spoil the show, so I won't comment on the story line. The story line was so-so and to be honest I felt like it was not worth the money I had paid for. I walked out of there feeling ripped off. The action was not as great as I imagined. i guess I went in with higher expectations. Especially when people were hyping it up. tisk tisk... that should be a sin!After reading about Picasso, I was super excited to book this place for my bf's birthday & our two year anniversary while visiting Las Vegas. I've been to many high end restaurants including many with michelin stars and was hoping for the best service & food here. 

Upon arrival we were greeted and seated outdoors so we can view the water show while having dinner. It was romantic, but it was so cold and they did not have gas/oil to turn on the outdoor lamps. When asked, they just said they couldn't turn them on since they were out of fuel. I was disappointed because I wore a nice dress here and wanted to enjoy the view while having a nice meal. Minus 1 star!

Based on the menu, I was hoping for declious dishes! My boyfriend & I ordered a variety of dishes, but the food wasn't consistent. Some came out cold, others warm. The warm dishes were tasty, but food left out cold, just doesn't taste well after a period of time. I remember the scallop being cold and chewy. Minus 1 more star!

I give this place 3 stars because their food wasn't all bad, the drinks were good, and the service was okay. For the amount we paid for our meal, we could've had a better meal. I probably will not come back here.Tabu, what can I say about 'choo? :P  We had Pure AND XS guess lists set up for our choosing pleasure but alas, our early morning flight made us change our minds to do something not too crazy on our last night in Vegas.  

Since we stayed at the MGM, we found the guy who was giving away wristbands for ladies.  It was to our advantage to go here because the guys would be able to get in free with their room cards.  The only restriction the guy gave to us was that girls would get open bar from 10-11pm but that was it.

With that in mind, we headed back to our room for some much needed naps.  4 nights in a row of heavy dancing and drinking will do that to you :P  After getting ready, we decided to drink and wander the casino a bit.  It was great to catch up and just talk while sipping our drinks.  

Not sure exactly what time we headed over to Tabu Lounge but I do remember that since the guy had put us on the guest list, we were able to walk in right away.  That's not saying much because there wasn't a line anyway.  Haha.

We were ready to boogie on the dance floor, unfortunately, the girl at the front told us that the "girls get in free with a wristband" and the "guests of MGM get in free with a room card" promotions ended at midnight.  Bullshit.  There was no mention of this at any time when we talked to the guy who hooked us up.  

I was pretty annoyed so I sweet talked her out of my (girl) friend and I having to pay.  Unfortunately for my friend's boyfriend, they slapped him with a $20 cover charge.  Luckily, we still had room credit to burn before our flight out so it actually worked out well.

Since I was planning for a chill night, I was actually happy that there weren't that many people because it meant I had more room to get down and dirty.  I'm half kidding.  I love dancing and I hate when there are people rubbing up against me, invading my dancing bubble.  How am I supposed to bust out my best moves if there's some chick just standing in the middle of the floor sipping her drink?

Even though it wasn't very crowded, there were lots of guys on the prowl, that's for sure.  Many came my way and I blatantly danced away.  Haha.  Sorry boys, maybe next time try talking to me first before you try to rub your dick all over me.
I'm not exactly sure how much drinks were because we charged those to the room too but I think it was like thirty-something dollars for 2 drinks, that's a bit steep in my opinion but hey, it's Vegas so I didn't think much of it.

The DJ was kind of shitty because she kept playing her remixed songs for waaay too long.  At least play the whole damn song for 3 minutes instead of playing your version for that amount of time that just freaking repeats.  Regardless, I was still able to dance my heart out so I was happy.

We left around 2am to grab some grub.  If I wanted to have a "quiet" night of dancing and just hanging out with friends, I would go here only if I stayed at the MGM.  Otherwise, definitely not worth it.  But check it out if you have nothing better to do.  Make sure to get on that guest list though!We stayed at theHotel this time around in Vegas.  Even though we had ordered room service for a late-night dinner using our $100 room credit, we still found ourselves hungry when it was time to check out.  Most of the eateries in Mandalay Bay were still closed, so we weren't very picky.  Seeing that Red, White, and Blue was open - it was our final destination for food before heading out.  

There was four of us, and they seated us at a very comfortable spacious booth that I dare say was probably the best seat in the place.  Thumbs up! Our party of four soon became a party of six and then a party of nine!  Our server was super patient, nice, and accommodating!  

The food here was decent.  The BF had the Ultimate Breakfast which included NY steak, 3 eggs, bacon, toast, hash browns, and fruit.  I had the French Toast with their vanilla creamy yumminess.  Their vanilla cream was so sweet and delicious that I would substitute it for maple syrup anyday!  It suited my French Toast perfectly!  I added their berries (extra $4), but was disappointed to see that the berries were not fresh.  My friends had their clam chowder in a bread bowl, fried chicken, buffalo wings, Denver omelet, and a couple also had the Ultimate Breakfast.  Overall, I think that my French Toast was the best thing on our table, and I would recommend it over everything else that I've listed!  Shhhh! =D  The food was definitely better than what I had anticipated. 

My biggest boos about this place are the price and the wait.  It was quite pricey for decent typical "American" food.  The wait between the time that we ordered and when the food came out was unacceptable when some of my friends wanted to put their heads down from the hunger of the wait.  Good thing we weren't in a hurry.  But what can I say?  We paid for the convenience.In comparison, you might as well come here cause the food court next door is only a couple bucks cheaper but you get substantially more here.

Plus you get a nice sit down, and friendly servers.

Their bread is a little hard though so if you're getting a sandwich, think twice!I have only been to house of blues for concerts, not to eat here (no vegan options!).  

The venue is OK, I think it's decent for concerts, it's small, has a General admission and seating section.  Full Bar down stairs and decent bathrooms.  The staff has always been decent when I have been there.  

The drink prices are about as good as you would expect, especially for vegas.  Not sure what else people expect to find.  My suggestion is to hit up the bar across from HOB and get a huge freezy drink for $9 with an extra shot.  It will save you money (unless you want water).

I would come back here again, and I love Mandalay Bay too!Tryst has totally been outdone by XS but at least both are owned by the same dude so it's not like they're losing money.

Came here because XS was way too crowded and found this place to be just short of what everyone loves about XS.  Place is small (you wouldn't have said that unless you've seen the massive size of XS) and music is the same crappy house/trance stuff (they probably have the same DJs).  I used to put Tryst at the top of my Vegas club list with Tao but you've been topped!last nites nightmare just confirms my dining out on a Saturday  is for the very patient . some friends are in town and they wanted to go here for dinner ,mind you the setting is quaint and the food is good (not killer) but good we showed up right at prime dining time ...well at least east valley dining time 630 ish and the place was packed ..we decided to go for it only because our guests were wanting to eat here ..fine i have no problem i decided to go with the flow after a hard day of working and a bitchy wife ragging in my ear . i gave the very nice young lady our name and she says ...it will be a 45 minute wait.....i NEVER wait more than 5 minutes ,45 minutes  OK I'm going with the flow as we stood there for 20 minutes i asked one of the employs if we could get some chips and salsa while we waited  ..he says   I DON'T KNOW...??? i said can you check he walked away and  then when he returned he 
said yes its 3 dollars ...i said is that the same chips and salsa you get for free at the table ???yes he said hmmmm never mind its not the 3 dollars its the principle. we were finally seated after some more confusion on what table we were to be seated at ,we were brought water and that FREE bowl of chips and two small ramicans of salsa  and then we sat for another 10/15 minutes before our server got to take our order ,she says look s like your ready to order ....YOU THINK! as we sat there for another 30 minutes waiting for our food i was bound and determined to get my fill of those free chips and salsa although it looked like they were starting to ration the salsa since i had to ask 3 times for more salsa. The table next to us were seated before us and we got our food first they were starting to get a little pissy ,they asked for somthing to hold them over and the wait person said the only way to get ??? was to order ???  the women said just forget it and asked for the manager .the manager came to there table and said were serving over 700 dinners tonite like it was those damn customers fault this table had not got there food and told them there was 4 tickets in front of theres but there food should be up in the next 15 minutes .....wow really maybe bring this table the bean dip or whatever it was as a justure of CUSTOMER SERVICE....CHIPS SALSA RING A BELL ... ok i cant be to harsh on them it was a zoo but i really think they need to work on there customer service a little moreOk here goes.  I'll start with the bad and finish positive.  As far as Pizza goes, which is what we went for, I was not that impressed.  I must say I'm more of a NY style, by the slice pizza kind of guy.  So the pizza did not hit the spot.  Maybe a little too fancy for my palette. (You can take a boy out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of the boy, so for me simple food is always better.)  Obviously, there are enough people who like gourmet pizza as this place has amazing reviews, so I'm just one simple man.

The obnoxious fat chick sitting right behind me proclaimed to her friend, "I'm no longer investing time in men who aren't available!"  Put down the pizza and grab a dry salad and shut up!!  That's not really the restaurants fault though but I did have to endure that convo through the duration of my meal.

Our server was very nice however seemed very rushed and at times we had to wait for refills on water and for the check.  The atmosphere is very romantic outside with light trees and live music.  They even turned on one of the heaters on the patio for the lil lady.  We has the Crepe with Nutella chocolate powdered sugar and ice cream and it was very very good.  

Bottom line.  I'd be willing to come here again and try something other than pizza.After all the hype, I just had to go try FEZ out for myself. 

On Monday I took my mom out to a late lunch around 2. Considering the time, I wasn't surprised to walk into an empty restaurant with only two other tables occupied. The decor was fun, but I'm definitely going to have to check it out at a busier time as I'm sure the atmosphere has got to be better with more people around. 

I did my homework before coming, so I knew they had 2 for 1 margaritas on Mondays. The waitress didn't know that. Haha. Good thing I was there to remind her. Although perhaps she was just thrown by two women ordering margaritas at 2 on a Monday afternoon. C'est la vie! My mom ordered the apricot margarita and I got the orange margarita. Both were tasty, strong and healthy portions. 

Having never been, I wanted to try a few different things. We ended up ordering the lettuce wraps, the rosemary chicken sandwich and a basket of the sweet potato fries to share. When everything arrived, I couldn't believe how much food there was. It would have been nice if the waitress had advised us on the portion size and told us ahead of time that there was a $1 charge for splitting a meal. (I can understand charging that if 2 people order just one entree to share, but technically we ordered two and a side. If I'd known, I could have just ordered one thing and she the other and we could have divided them up ourselves. It's not a big deal but just one of those strange little avoidable surprises at the end of a meal.)

As for the food, the sweet potato fries were amazing. I've had them many places and I have to say, these are the best by far. That dipping sauce is so perfect and the cinnamon sugar on the fries makes you feel like you're eating dessert (in a good way)! The lettuce wraps were pretty tasty, although I didn't expect them to be cold. They are served with romaine lettuce, rather than iceberg and that was a refreshing change. I don't know if I'll order them with the fries again because there was just too much sweetness going on for one meal. The rosemary chicken sandwich was really yummy. I couldn't believe how much chicken was on it! The best part was the subtle hint of feta. I'm a fan of the cheese, but only in small quantities and they had the perfect proportion. 

All in all it was a solid experience. I'll be coming back at least two more times - one with some friends during happy hour and another time for brunch as I've just got to try their eggs Benedict.We ate there this past weekend and I the food was top notch.  The value for the dollar seems to be a bit lacking.  $10 for hummus was about 1/2 what it could/should have been.  It tasted wonderful but $10 was too steep.  The lamb shanks my wife ordered were $23 and again, great taste but quite expensive for what you got.  Apple Martini was $10 and a Stella Artois on tap was about the same.

The one thing I really didn't like was the very loud music.  Seemed to 80's and kind of affected the mood.  I almost felt I was shouting over the music.  The service was good and the food was very savory.  

If you are looking for something unique, this is definitely worth a consideration.It's a cheap place (compared to other establishments in Vegas) to take a time out from whatever it is that we do in Vegas.  Head upstairs, there is a first come first serve dinning deck upstairs and even the occasional live music.  It's touristy, chessy, but what isn't chessy and touristy on the strip in Vegas??

After food and drinks for the 6 of us, it came out to around $150 per with tip.  We took a shot or two... or three.

But hey, that is like a round of blackjack at the tables.We had the second floor as part of a dinner a client was throwing. They were generous with the liquor and considering this client I was grateful for that.

The appetizers were good and the pulled pork was delicious but it was CRAZY LOUD.

It was scream across the table and barely be understood kind of loud.

It was "I wish they'd turn it from from building shaking to just ear splitting" kind of loud.

It was just give up and write notes on a napkin kind of loud.

If you're deaf and have been looking for a place where everyone else is just like you....You just found it.My family and I enjoyed this location even though it was different that we expected. First note: it is about a mile off the strip -so cabbing it is the best choice. 
This is not a 'museum' style place as we interpreted the description. It is a large building filled with machines from every era. Many of them have a description including the history - which was pretty cool. The cost is free to enter and the games range from .25 to 2.00 depending on the age. 
Obviously, these are originals and functioning. It was fun to see the history and timeline of pinball machines! Of course, we had a blast playing all of them too!We stayed at the Aria and this was convenient for breakfast.  The pastries are worth the money but they should invest into better coffee.  Here's my list of breakfast pastries and I've listed the better tasting ones first.

1)  breakfast panini
2)  sugar brioche
3)  chocolate croissant
4)  Cinnamon rollWhen you paid 40 per person and has to dressed in business casual you expect the buffet to be mind-blowing and magnificent right? Well, the buffet in Wynn is not even close to great. I know it has countless crab legs and amazing steak and maybe good dessert? People, don't listen to the tourist's review and ask locals. They will tell you Caesar palace and Aria's buffet are so much better. Seriously, I expected to have more choices than a mid-size room full of smartly-cooked-for-rip off level food. I spent 40 dollars to have 500 entrees at bellagio, real king crab legs at aria and top-notch grill at Bacchanal. If you are too hungry to move or just want to admire the "legend", don't held your expectation too high or you will be disappointed.I think Tex Tubbs does veggie tacos better than the meat tacos. I had the 2 taco plate today with the Hot Mama (Fried chicken soaked in house made buffalo sauce,
with fresh lettuce, julienned celery, pico de gallo, and sour cream in a handmade corn tortilla) and the Grilled Portabella Mushroom taco (Fresh spinach, roma tomatoes, crumbled goat cheese, toasted pumpkin seeds, and roasted poblano 
sour cream in a handmade corn tortilla.) The Hot Mama was very disappointing. If you love buffalo chicken you should not get this taco. I didn't get any of that hot buffalo flavor at all, mostly celery. And the fried chicken was just so sad. KFC has better fried chicken. This chicken had no flavor at all. I also got a side of the jicama slaw which had very little jicama in it, a couple of slices of mango, but lots of mayo and cabbage. Bland city. Put some caraway seeds in there or something. 

The one thing they did do right was the Portabella taco. The mushroom was marinated and sliced into strips and the goat cheese was tangy and perfect. 

Service was really slow. I walked in by myself around noon today and waited around for five minutes to be seated because no one was watching the front. Also, my server dropped my check off while I was in the middle of eating. Kind of presumptuous and rude. 

In summary, stick with the veggie tacos and stay away from their jicama slaw.I ate here for Halloween- it was pretty pleasant.  The wait staff was very entertained when we came in our costumes!  We had made reservations and we were seated underneath the gigantic crystal dragon.  The decor was very oriental yet contemporary.

Let me start of with a disclaimer though- you cannot compare this place to Wing Lei, as other reviewers have done.  Not only is Red 8 in the casual dining tier versus Wing Lei's fine dining classification, but Red 8 is meant to cater to a different crowd.  Tourists, yes, but a different type of tourist.  One who doesn't want to splurge on food, just wants something quick to eat, or wants a Pan-Asian meal because essentially, that is what Red 8 serves.

A reviewer earlier described this place pretty accurately- a Panda Express on steroids.  Just throw in some Indonesian, Thai, and Cantonese dishes in there and you're all set.

The food was pretty good- nothing stunning, but something worth its money.  I had the pineapple fried rice, which was very nice since I don't know of any other restaurant that makes that.  And actually, we were all mooching off of each others' dishes, so I can't remember everything I ate!  All I know is that I would go to Red 8 again- not too often, but if there's a small occasion to celebrate.

I'm giving this place 3 stars because of the food.  Noodles Restaurant and other casual dining restaurants that are similar to Red 8 deliver much better in terms of food.  I can't fault the service- it was flawless.  They were vibrant and worth going back just for to see them again.  Sadly, I can't say the same for the food.Wanting to try something different then just the Cirque shows in Vegas we decided to give the Blue Man Show a try.  Being that www.travelzoo.com had tickets for the same night for roughly $55/ person we couldn't turn it down.  Great bargain considering we paid $100/person for 'O' the previous night.

I have to say I really was surprised by the show.  I knew the show had some humor in it but I really wasn't expecting this much humor.  The first hour consisted of them doing many comedic acts along with pulling out a crowd member to participate.  Besides the opening act, I was disappointed that the first hour just consisted of pure comedy.  I mean don't get me wrong, they did a pretty good job of it but I was really here to see them play their instruments not stand around and stare at the crowd.

When the 2nd act did role around they did pick it up and they started to play some awesome music.  Overall, I was entertained but I just wish they showed off more of their drumming abilities.  Still debating if I really liked or disliked the show....The 1st time I saw this show was way back in the day... like way way back! I didn't like it much then... i thought it was dumb... i recently saw it again... i thought it was ok this time... it was pretty funny... kinda kool... but still dumb. Not really much to say about this show. I took my son and nephews - age range 12-18 yrs old - and they liked it. 

btw, the bottled water is way over priced... these places that overprice on things should really get busted for doin that... they are really rippn ppl off! a Dasani bottled water - just the regular size was $5. I bought 6 waters - total $30 -  WTF!!!!! Do you know how many bottled waters I coulda gotten with $30 if i went to Costco?!!!! DAMNNN!!!! so a big EFF U for over pricing on damn water!!!!!Having been here twice, I could've sworn the food was better the first time around. We were in semi-health-kick mode (read: "want burger, let's balance it with a salad.") The mini Kobe burgers with caramelized onions drained us $15 for 3 -- great flavor though. Salads are huge and can easily feed 2 people, but are plus-minus in content: The flank steak salad was tasty but chintzy with the beef. They also used cheaper iceberg lettuce; c'mon this is the WYNN! There should've been some nice greens in the salad, I would've paid more $$ for that. The higher quality, dark leafy greens -- all 4 sprigs of 'em -- were sitting as optional toppings on the edge of our Kobe burger plate.

Upsides: Beautiful, fresh decor; open 24 hours; great selection and presentations; the perfect example of upscale casual dining.
Downsides: Above-average prices; tends to get crowdedWe came here a couple of times during our stay and I think it's a solid choice if you don't want to drop the cash for a fancy place like Daniel Boulud. Still a bit expensive, like everything at the Wynn, but we enjoyed everything we ate, the portions were large, and it's open 24 hours. 

Food (4 stars):

I was a bit leery of the Teriyaki chicken sandwich--I mean don't all those "teriyaki" sandwiches taste pretty much the same? But this one was good! The chicken was tender, the sauce wasn't sickly sweet or overpowering, and the bun was hearty. It was a good sandwich. I usually only eat half a sandwich when they are big, but it was so good I couldn't stop eating it. And it came with onion rings. Yea!

Other things we tried: 

Spaghetti bolognese with garlic bread was really heavy on the meat but tasty. Salad (mixed greens or something simple like that) came with a flavorful vinaigrette. Grilled veggie pita with couscous was really good. Manhattan clam chowder was pretty good but a little salty. A cup was just enough. And the coffee was good.

Service (1 star):

I just have to say that the service we experienced in Las Vegas was pretty much across the board bad (or on the bad side of the spectrum). I thought Las Vegas was supposed to be a service-oriented town, but it's the worst service I've ever experienced. And I'm a pretty patient and undemanding person when it comes to service. 

The times we went to the Terrace Pointe Cafe, service was slooow (even when not busy; slooooower when it was), the waiters would disappear after serving your food and you couldn't even spy one across the room to wave them down for a bit of ketchup or your bill. Personality-wise the waiters we got were courteous but either overworked/indifferent or somewhat snooty.

My advice: 1) Be prepared in advance for anything you might possibly need for your meal and ask for it all at once. 2) Keep an eye out for your waiter and when you are close to 3/4 done with your meal, flag him down for your check and any take-home boxes you might need even if you plan to stay a bit longer over dessert and coffee. 

Laugh now, thank me later...The meal was pretty good but for the price ($200 each with drinks and appetizers), I expected just a little more.  I had the ribeye which was impressive but not the best I've ever had.  It had decent flavor and was actually quite tender.  My friends each had the filet. They seemed satisfied but not blown away.  They had three different sauces to go with the steaks.  This isn't really my style as most good steakhouses let the meat speak for itself.  Also, I found it odd that even though we ordered different cuts of meet, we got the same sauces to go on our meet.  Shouldn't a world class chef be more creative?  Also, the server was unable to tell  which sauces were better for each cut.  

Their wine list was impressive and had all of the Napa wines you would expect to see and most other good Caliornia wines.  We went for a bottle of Justin Isosceles.  It was a very good bordeaux blend that paired well with our steaks.  

The server was friendly but might have been more appropriate for casual dining than a fine steakhouse.  He joked with us that our table was typically one of the worst in the restaurant because it was one of the only tables without a view of the Bellagio fountains.  We were a group of successful 20-somethings so I'm used to not getting the best service but to make it blatant that the hostess gave us the worst table in the restaurant sort of ruined the meal.  Honestly, we hadn't even realized the other tables had a view until he said this and never would have even realized it was a bad table but once he said something, we were left wondering why we were given a bad table.This Maggiano's, like all the others, is what it is....but a little bit better given the excellent viewpoint from the fashion show mall out onto the strip.  Went here with 12 people and had wonderful time despite the mediocre food.  Like all chains, the menu is formulaic and there are hits and misses.  

Hits include the super garlicy Shrimp Oreganata, Garlic Shrimp Linguine, and Lobster Ravioli.  Needless to say, they do garlic right.  The tiramisu was also quite tasty and enormous (not that this matters much since Maggiano's is all you can eat)

Misses included a mediocre (actually pretty bad) gnocchi, oily and limp Eggplant Parmesan, and cheesecake that was heavy and flavorless.

I last went t this Maggiano's back in 2005 and can't say I'd recommend it for 'fine dining,' but in terms of bang-for-your-buck in Las Vegas it is certainly a valid option.

2 Stars for the food, 4 for a good time atomsphere with a big group.  Its closer to a 2.5 than a 3, but I'll round up for good memories.Waiter suggested special - chicken lasagna- Alfredo sauce almost non existent but dish still good. Ordered the second special ravioli with lemon "cream" sauce - it arrived and the sauce was like warm milk - very watered down - sent it back and split the lasagne.This buffet distinguishes itself from the rest of the Vegas buffet with its incredible variety and its spaced out fairly well. Service has been very friendly each time I've visited, however, the prices have skyrocketed from $15 to nearly $25 for dinner time which one might question when eating the endless varieties of pastas, tacos, and other relatively inexpensive food items. The food is not as good after 8:30 it seems since they're less likely to replace and cook more fresh items. Best recommended for dining between 5-7 PM.I guess I'll keep this one short and sweet as I know future follow-ups will be posted.  With all the new hotels and buffet places sprouting on and off the strip, I feel as if Rio's have lost some of it's touch!  It's my 4th time coming here this year and will probaby be back on Labor Day weekend, that's if we don't go to that one letter initial buffet/hotel place off the strip :-)

Some Highlights:

- Selection: Italian, breakfast, Mexican, all the mainstream Asian food, and seafood
- Crablegs galore: My bf is in heaven!
- Great staff service: Even though all they do is serve drinks, all my experiences have been quite pleasant and friendly.  This past weekend, one gave me his contact for club promoter hookups.

- DESSERT:  This is my favorite part of the this buffet!  My bf and I come to this place solely for the all you can eat gelato and cannolis (sp?).  Yes, we have a sweet tooth indeed!  There are variety of flavors and I introduced it to one of my gfs this weekend and she it was to die for!!!  I've must've died several times and gone to gelato heaven!!!

Overall...
Okay, enough about my gelato and canolli (sp?) obssessions!  I can't really say anything extremely bad about this place.  Ten years ago, I would've rated it with 5 stars.  But for the food selection, quality, service, and the length of time waiting in line (less than 20 min on not-so-busy time), Rio is your average Vegas buffet with the not-so average gelato and canolli selections!  

BF's review:  Crablegs are the bomb!

ShoeFreak adds:  5 inches or taller - it's a Vegas requirement!  Must rock some stylish spiked heels!The food is still great.... but the locals discount has been cut back, we wont be commin back nearly as much now. Bad move on the Rio !Food is average but the ambiance is worth the trip. Very cool place to have a drink and check out the sights.Not a buffet lover but decided since that's Vegas I needed to try one. The Le Village Buffet was rated the best in Vegas and I can see why. The food was delicious and there was plenty of it. I can't imagine anyone making it through all the selections available. Please save room for dessert, I should have started here. I had the lunch buffet and the price is on the high end for Vegas buffets (but you are at the Paris) but worth the extra dollars to make sure you get good food. Very little wait but we were there on a weekday. As you pay for your meal you are asked if you want to add an additional amount for drinks. Do this if you are going to be drinking alcohol as more than one glass can pay for it. Dress was casual for lunch.We were in line for the Paris Buffet for about 10 minutes, but guess what?  We weren't.  We got seated for this joint.

I had a cobb salad.  Standard stuff.  The Bachelore had chicken fingers.  Eh.  My other bud had breakfast food.  He got served pancakes instead of the french toast he ordered.  Bonus.

The waiter was a nice guy in a ho hum place.  

Bottom line:  Walk all the way to the back of the hallway for the buffet line.I fit the stereotype of an Asian.  I like my noodles, especially in a big Asian bowl.  This place, inside the luxurious Bellagio, doesn't specialize in one region but many Asian countries are represented here.  It makes the decision hard to pick just one.  I opted for the Udon noodle soup since it's something you don't see too much since Ramen seems to be the more popular soup in Japan.  Soup was good, not great and I enjoyed it.  Because of other Asian noodle shops in Vegas, I probably have my list that I must go to every time I'm in Vegas.  This is not one of those.  On the other hand, if I were walking by and I was hungry or someone wanted to go in, you won't have to twist my arm.I think you need to be drunk here.

A big group of us went here for one of my girlfriend's birthday (she loves all that is Hawaiian).  We all had fruity, crazy drinks including the birthday gal who had some crazy blue drink in punch bowl which was smoking and had sparklers in it.  We all had pretty basic, unmemorable food which probably all had some sort of "island" twist to it.

The more we drank, the more fun it became.  So, we drank a lot.  That's what I would suggest you do if you find yourself here.I ordered soooooooooooooo much food!

The meatball - delicious with the greens!
Popcorn - couldn't really taste the spice, but it was all eaten
Chicken - very tender, although some may say its a bit dry, not to me
Tarte flambee - i usually don't eat bread, but this is nicely cooked, crispy and delicious
Tuna taco - a bit disappointing as I thought it would have more sauce, more on the dry side..
Duck - was pretty fair, although not the best..it was fair


I had a restaurant.com so $50 off the bill was nice. It's great if you want to try out the place.

I think service could of been better, and maybe if they wouldn't blast the AC, would of been better. It's more of a tapas type of place, so be prepare to eat a lot or order a lot because of the portion size.Ehhh Its ok. I liked it before they remade it over. The deals were better before then too. The food court is still the same. And people in the kiosks are pushing stuff on you, that you clearly dont need. But as with everything look hard enough and you will find a deal hiding somewhere. Also if you dont want the food in the court. Good restaurants in the surrounding parking lot arent in short supply either.Service is okay and the beer selection is cool as well.

The food is meh. I have tried a few different items, but will stick with liquid meals at this establishment haha.

The service is so-so as well. It's slow and they can be rude.If you are going to have breakfast in Mandalay Bay this is your best bet. Huge portions and good quality. The pancakes and huevos rancheros were both very good.
Friendly, quick service.This place is okay for late night eats as it's pretty much the only thing open after midnight (which is LAME in Vegas!). We enjoyed the food we had at 2 in the morning but that was if course after a full night of drinks and dancing.  Cannot recommend choosing Raffles for a nice evening out.Pretty good dancing music. Very crowed though with a long line. If you are with just girls you can try to cut the line. We did and got in for free. I couldn't of imaged waiting! Not very many places to chill unless you get a VIP table.I love their food - but I am torn, I can't give them four stars because there service REALLY needs to improve!  I just go there to practice being Zen-like!  No matter how bad the service is I just smile!  In addition, I only sit outside because it is really loud inside which is far from enjoyable.Ehhh.  If you're coming from the Bay Area or LA, this place can't compare to some of the dim sum establishments there.  Place serves dim sum all day, but there wasn't much variety going around the carts when we were there.  We really wanted some Shanghai Dumplings and was told it was coming each time we asked.  Finally, we flagged down one of the waitresses to ask about it and she told us it would be 15-20 minutes for them to make it.  It was never really coming at all!

Shiu Mai, har gow, bean curd skin, chow fun, baked buns, steamed buns, gai lan, etc.  were all decent though a bit small compared to standard.  Not a bad place overall.  It's a bit away from the strip.Given the location and the lack of good food options in this hotel, I'll have to give the food 4 stars, but the service gets 2 stars. I've eaten 3 meals here throughout the day and the service is always a problem. They have multiple people caring for your table, normally one guy is solid, and the other 2 are clueless (low cost). 

The food is decent overall, but the service is really bad. 

Brunch was probably the best meal, but they have some good salad options as well. The pastas and red sauce they make is pretty bad, I would avoid the marinara.Convenience was what got this one 3 stars. The food was good, the prices were outrageous for anywhere else in the western hemisphere but down right cheap for Vegas, and it was convenient and open at all G*d awful hours that we were awake.I've been to other Original Pancake House locations, but for some reason the one inside the Green Valley Ranch Casino was better.  Maybe it was the excitement of the casino and family from out of town, but we had a great experience.  The service was great, and my family now say it's going to be a tradition to go there for breakfast, when ever they come to visit me in town.  

The Blueberry Crepes is a must order...Delish!!!The only reason they get a 3 star and not 4 is because because i was expecting them to be as good as there counterpart egg works. Unfortunately not so. It was good, better than Ihop but not that stellar amazing flavor Im used to from these chains. Anyway the service was quick and the waitress was very personable so ya if Im in the neighborhood I will go againSlowest
coffeehouse
service
ever

Do *not* go here if you are in any sort of a hurry, day or night.

Food is okay.I have heard all the hype and the negative.  I am involved with the cabinet/furniture industry so I am pretty critical.  I went in with low expectations and was pretty much in agreement with those expectations.  They have some inexpensive stuff that I thought was cheap and some pretty good stuff that was expensive.  I did spot some gems for the price but they were hard to find.  To say it was an experience would be an understatement.  You are guided by a walkway with few options to shortcut.  The place was full of people.  If you intend to buy any furniture items you need to be prepared with a pad of paper or one of their handy shopping sheets so you can pick up your stuff from the self service warehouse at the end of the loop using the item numbers you have recorded.  This isn't apparent before your first tour.  I did not get to try the meatballs because of other eating commitments.

A tip for those trying to check in: The metal roof makes GPS unusable so you have to go outside.This was the very First buffet I ever went to in Vegas. and back then it was Great!!!! now as time has passed I hate to say it they have slipped in the ranking. Dont get me wrong the food is still good but not what it once was. The prices though have staied high but the food is not up to par anymore. Even the  Roundtable Buffet is a little bettter now.I'm usually very picky about buffets because I prefer quality over quantity but MGM's buffet was alright and I was surprised. Everything tasted fresh and was pretty appetizing. However, I had a little over an hour wait...but it's Las Vegas, so what do you expect?Sensi is hit and miss. The food was mostly very good. The atmosphere was excellent. The service was middling.

First, the food. The naan bread was good but the yogurt/ cucumber dip was a flat miss. The ham and avocado on brioche was excellent. The oysters were really good. They had four different kinds. If I could have understood the fellow who brought them, it would have been helpful. Both salads were good. My wife's scallops were really tasty. My "special" 18 oz. bone-in ribeye was 10 ounces of fatty, unevenly cooked steak and 8 ounces of bone. The fact that it was $75 was just preposterous. Only in Vegas!

The service was middling. A little off, a little slow, a little unintelligible. It was a large ticket and I hated giving my waiter a large tip because he just wasn't that good.

Atmosphere was cool and romantic. That was about the only thing that what universally appealing.

I'd go back but I wouldn't order the "special" and I would hope to get a better waiter.

Smiley face.Dim sum here is pretty good for a Vegas joint. However, I did not like the service! When my friend and I first got here (around 1130), we had to wait about 10-15 min before we could get some tea or even water to drink! It wasn't even that busy yet, and we were seated right away! Usually, at many dim sum places, it is automatic to get tea or water right away! Also, the carts did not come to our side very often, so we had to make sure to get plenty of things before we started really eating! (Especially the dessert cart! Geez! That one took forever to come by!).

The place is also pretty small. We can barely get into or out of our seats, since they were so close together (so I just stayed in mine the whole time without moving it heheh!). 

The only thing that I tried here that was not as common as other dim sum places was their soft tofu dessert with sugar/ginger syrup. It tasted like a Filipino dessert called Ta-ho (except Ta-ho is sweeter and not ginger-tasting). That was pretty good. They also had a seaweed salad, (which looked very good but didn't come until we were waiting for our check), and we couldn't try it! Other than those two, just your typical dim sum place with a limited quantity of items!

I probably would not go back here, especially if I ever have to wait! Geez...wait for a table...and then WAIT for a drink...and then WAIT for the dim sum...and even WAIT for our check/to go boxes! 

Unless you're with a big party, this place would probably be decent to have dim sum. Be ready to FLAG those cart people! Expect a wait on the weekends starting around 12 (We went on a Sunday). 

Btw, the price for most of the dim sum is about $3 a piece, so it could add up if you want to try lots of things...(They also charge for tea!)I'm a little iffy about my true feelings for Oreganos, so as of right now they get three stars. I plan to give them another shot and dine in, since the order i got was to-go. Anywho, stopped in here and we checked out the menu ordered an order of the golden wings ( I believe they are called) hot/sweet flavor... these were very good. Also some on the meatiest wings I have ever had to be honest, hormone injected wings up in this joint is what you will get and they are very tasty. the boyfriend ordered the lasagna and the girl told us it would take 45 min alone for the lasagna..luckily we had a few errands to run so it was cool to come back and get our food but i  think that would have sucked if we had been eating there and having to wait ( especially if you were starving). Then again it's nice to know its cooked fresh. I had the Pesto pasta which came in a nice scooped out bread bowl with my choice of meat.. I got the Italian sausage. 

Everything was o.k, I went with high expectations and was let down a little, will try one of their pizzas next maybe that's the winner dish to have here..

p.s staff is very helpful/friendly and it is a nice atmosphere inside and out on the patio as well.I know the chef de cuisine was awarded the James beard award but I thought the food was just okay. Perhaps I'm a good snob given the volume of fantastic restaurants in NYC but for the price and all the hyped reviews, I thought the food was underwhelming. 

Starter: tres ceviches
-consisted of three different types of seafood ceviches that took longer to compose than it did for me to consume. It was worth the wait as anything doused with lime juice is a win for me. My favorite of the trio was the lobster escabeche with avocado tempura. Flavor notes were reminiscent of nachos lol. The tuna third of the app was great, served with a coconut milk sauce. There was a weird popcorn garnish that I thought was completely unnecessary.  

Main: I had the special of the night which was zucchini wrapped scallops with skirt steak
-scallops weren't seared as well as they could've been. No real crust and wrapping then in zucchini only made them mushy. However I have to respect the quality of the actual ingredient and they were a pair of meaty and juicy scallops!  The steak it was served with was smothered in this weird, cloyingly sweet sauce that was completely off putting. It was served over a bed of sautéed mushrooms that was also drenched in this sugary gloop. I was really sad that I wasn't able to clean my plate as I generally try to do everywhere I eat (think of the starving children in the world) but the sauce ruined things for me. I did my best to wipe it off the meat but even then I was chewing and swallowing with my breath held and mentally clenched teeth. 

Overall: service was great and liked my app but the entree depressed me. Maybe the standard menu options would've been better but if you're looking to try something new, avoid the special!Yelp Rating: High; Expectations: High; Reality: So-so. I ordered what the server recommended (Carne Adovada), but there just wasn't a lot of flavor (a rare fluke?). I think I'm going to have to go back to make sure I'm not missing something.I had the grilled shrimp, the enchiladas, and the sliders. Nothing really blew me away and although I asked for spicy, it wasn't. The shrimp was the best. 

It was also really hard to find and was not on the corner like the directions said.They do have a large selection of boots and this where my cowboy friend bought his boots a few years ago.  We had heard that there was a January clearance sale going on but when we went inside we didn't really find anything on sale.  We only ended up getting one T-shirt that cost around $25.00.  Nothing is cheap in here so be prepared to shell out big bucks for your country wares!  I actually prefer the stores in Norco and Torrance (California) than this one.I thought this place was so bomb but now that I think about it, it was okay. Located at the Imperial Palace Hotel, I came here with a group of friends before leaving home to Cali. 

I ordered their famous chicken and waffle tower. That thing is freaking huge so good thing I shared. The chicken was a little dry and stiff. The waffle tasted like a waffle. I did like the caramelized shredded green onions they had with it though. Meh, it was ok. The food definitely looks appetizing though but for me, it wasn't the best. We ordered the Kiwi Watermelon drink. It tasted weird to me. Well actually, it was good until I mixed it. I don't know what it was but it was weird. 

The service here incredible. Our waiter was so attentive to us even when he was clearly very busy. He was pretty cute too along with his other coworkers :P anyways, I wouldn't come back here if I was in Vegas, Maybe in San Diego though.So I got a $200 gift card from a very nice catering manager at Tao after we had a successful company party that we threw during CES 2009. My bf and I decided to dine here during my stay in Vegas for CES 2010. We had to wait for our table even though we had made reservations, so we went to the bar and I had a mojito while we sat in that crowded area. We were seated in 15 minutes. The place is very asian and sexy...but kinda crowded. We had lobster crab cakes & wontons as appetizers. For our main course we had this huge spicy lobster, prawns and scallops in black bean sauce. Food was decent, service was okay as well. I probably wouldn't go back here unless it was for someone's birthday or something.My co-workers and I enjoy going to the Triple 7 Microbrewery for lunch.  It is a hidden gem in downtown Las Vegas, located at Main St Station.

The food is bar food...pizzas, sandwiches, appetizers, etc.

Some of my favorite dishes are:

- Focaccia vegetable sandwich.
- Chicken Philly Sandwich
- Pizza
- Burgers

The beer is really good too.  Can't remember the names of the ones I enjoy...will try to next time.

Will I go back?  Absolutely.  Why only 3 Stars?  Because of the location...if it wasn't downtown, I'd give it 4 Stars.It's a typical casino cafe with typical casino cafe food. 

They do have a sushi bar, but it didn't look like something I wanted to try. I did buy a jug of beer from there and that was pretty good.beer.. sausage.. pork patties.. potatoes.. pickled cabbage.
mmm then nap time.

anytime i find a german bier garden I try my hardest to get to it and considering i was only in AZ for a couple days i thought it was a good chance to try haus murphy's.. 

from the looks of things from pictures from other yelpers it looked promising.. 
figured i'd get some good beer and brats.

so by the time i made it out there i was starving and we still had to wait for 2 more people to show... this could have added to my crankiness because i think we waited for 30 minutes watching every car drive by.

it would have probably made me feel better to get a beer first but i didn't want to go in by myself considering the kitchen staff came out to stare while i was doing a walk through to check out what we were dealing with.

so most of the patrons had white/silver hair.. and it looked like they were celebrating life.

it's more homestyle than i thought it would be but when you hear beer garden and lounge.. you think it should be more happening but it was a thursday night in glendale and the place closes at 9.. i should have put it all together.

the place is huge.. it's actually the restaurant for the first half of the building then the backside is the lounge.. then alongside the entire building is the beer garden.

it was a nice nite out so we decided to stay outside in the beer garden.

the service is nice and helpful.. it's too bad the food didn't cut it.
their brats were spongy.. weisswurt had a different spice in it i couldn't put my finger on and the only sausage on the baunerplatte that was decent was knack wurst.. but that's just like a regular hot dog.

their mustard was just the generic haines spicy brown mustard... i think they could have made it much more authentic or gone with something with more flavor.. 

the schniztel was good.. but nothing more than a breaded cutlet.. which is what it is.. and i'd rather get it with donkatsu sauce at a japanese place.. the kossler kotelett.. is explained as a boiled pork chop.. which if you really think about it.. it's a slice of ham..  which it was.. and nothing too spectacular..

all the meats were pilled on top of either sauerkraut or pickled red cabbage and then on the sides of the plate were fried potatoes and the german potato salad.. nothing more than diner style fried potatoes.. but i did not get to try the potato salad because my non food adventurous friends got to it first.

the highlight is the atmosphere.. it's very welcoming and you have different sections to sit in depending on what you want to make of your night..

they have an awesome beer selection.. i wanted the spaten oktoberfest but they ran out and got me a different oktoberfest edition beer..
but the one that took the cake was the warstener dunkle.. 
it's a brown ale.. but it's so light and crisp you'd think it was a blonde.. 
it's absolutely delicious.. i was so jealous i didn't get it.. and even more so when my friend was billed $5 for his 32 oz and i had a 16 oz of the oktoberfest.. sheesh.. 
the other item i can vouch for is the soup of the day which was potato soup.. i didn't think i would care for it because we had the mount of potatoes and pickled cabbage.. but the soup was my favorite.. it was perfectly seasoned.. and pureed... and dipping their prebought buns into the soup was delicious.. it's a shame both the bread and the soup were the smallest in portion out of everything.

i still prefer red lion tavern in LA or hofbrauhaus in vegas...

but haus murphy's food did do the sleep trick.. i went back to my friends place and took a nap.. i don't know.. something about the beer and sausage mix that just makes me want to sleep right after.. it's worse than turkey dinners!

i forgot to mention they now serve absinthe..Hm....this place is no different from Corleone's on Mill.....except its in Old Town Scottsdale.  Food here is on par with Corleone's.  And of course, same as Corleone's in the fact that they charge for everything, and you'll end up spending $10-14 for a cheesesteak, fries, and a drink.  Now if I had a choice between the 2 places?  Tough call, I can't say that I could really differentiate the 2.Food was ok.  We had a group of 5 and the orders were as follows: 

2 orders of fish tacos
1 tortilla soup and house salad
Taco salad
Shrimp fajitas

Great portions and reasonable prices for them.  Service was slow though.It's the DMV.  But I have always found that going Mid week. Mid month is best time to go .. very short wait - Relatively speaking and its too early for the staff to start  taking their 4 hour, union mandated breaks and three hour lunches. .

The west flamingo office is great.  Large waiting area and security keeps the riff raff outside. it has a snack bar and plenty of parkingi now have been to Vincitorios 2 times.  once for dinner several months ago, and back today for lunch.  overall it's a fine place, the garlic bread is warm and flavourful, the staff were extra friendly and on top of our station...tho it should be noted that we were the only table seated in the place.  it was Memorial day after all, and by the time we left, less than an hour later there were another 12 people seated and happy to be waited on. months ago i had the chicken fettuccine alfredo with asparagus, and it was excellent.  i had leftovers to spare, the cannoli was for dessert and i remember it being extra dolled up w/ choc. chips and raspberries, and thought we would get 2 for the $6 price tag.  we did not.  there, was however  an accordion player mixing in james taylor and U2 songs to keep it "authentic."  
today a friend of mine was told to check the place out for their "philly cheese steak" so we both go and order one each.  i said hold the onions but give me the marinarra.  my friend did the exact opposite.  it was fast, the home-made chips were awesome, the cheese steak was really good.  i didn't finish mine so i could eat it again tonight for dinner.  i will be happy to do so... our bill was 20 bucks for the both of us so it's really well priced!! and the place was relaxed and groovy.... so before you check out a cheap movie or just after the movie lets out @ tempe cinema, check out vincitorios.  i might make it more of a staple.This is a cute little cafe right in the same shopping center as Lalibela Cafe. When we went in, there were a bunch of families having a cute little brunch. I just got a strawberries and cream macaroon, a vanilla bean and rum macaroon, and two coffees. They were decently good. I especially liked the strawberries and cream macaroon which had some strawberry jam in the middle. mmmmm! In the vanilla bean and rum macaroon, you could definitely taste that hint of rum which was yummy!

I'll have to come back and try the food. It looked yummy!We walked in and no one greeted us for at least 10 minutes of standing their awkwardly.

I had 2/2 pancake & egg (scrambled) w/sausage patti.
Husband had same (over easy) w/hashbrowns.

Sausage patties were too salty, pancakes were ok but a little overlooked on one side making me work to cut into them. Eggs were great.

If the service was better we may have given a better rating.This is the first place I went to when I got into Phoenix for vacation, my cousin who lives in phoenix with his wife brought myself, and a friend of theirs to this fine little place in their neighborhood.  I liked the decor, it added an old west flavor to Italian style cooking.  We sat near the bar.  I order the Scampi fra diavalo.  It was bigger than I had expected.  And as expected did not finish it, however, ate all the shrimps with it.  Before that, we had hot bread with oil dressing, which was very good.  The service was friendly and I really enjoyed it.  Definitely worth making another trip someday, but will ask for what might be smaller to eat.  As for drinks, I had a blue moon and with everything, the prices were reasonable.This was a tricky review to write. I REALLY wanted to like this place, it came so highly recommended, but my experience was less than ideal. We went on a Thursday for their $25 couples menu. 

I'll start at the beginning... 

The hostess seated us. That was it. No menus, nothing. Just seated us. Ok. Fine. I assumed that meant that the server would be along shortly, after all she was at the table right next to us. We waited over 10 minutes just to be acknowledged. We didn't even get a "Hi guys, I'll be with you in one sec" which I would have been fine with. Eventually the server came over and asked if we wanted anything to drink. Still no menus at this point. Luckily, we didn't want anything fancy, since we had no idea what they had in terms of drinks. 

Another few minutes passed and she brought us menus, and within 5 minutes came back sans drinks and asked if we were ready to order. Yeah, no. She was more concerned about the 6 top of college kids than the 2 lesbians by the window. 

We'd been there almost half an hour before getting our drinks and our bread (which was good). I just wasn't impressed.

Our food, however, was excellent. Unfortunately, because I procrastinated  in writing this review, I can no longer find what we ordered on their menu, so I can't even recommend it. I think I had the penne pastore, which had incredible flavours, and my partner had something with farfale. But since Harley's has since removed their date night menu from their website I can't tell you exactly what. The portion sizes were perfect, and $25 per couple for an appetiser, 2 small entrees and dessert, the price was definitely right. 

I do remember getting the calimari as an appetiser, and it was ok, but I've definitely had better. The pieces were thin, and it was kind of greasy. There tended to be more breading than squid, which I hate. If you're a fan of good calamari, I'd say try the bruschetta. 

Dessert was amazing, though! We got the chocolate lava cake and shared between the two of us it was just enough sweet and a great way to end the meal. 

Looking at the other reviews, I don't think my service issues were a fluke. It seems to be a recurring theme here. You'd think they'd get the hint and start trying to fix it. The food was good at least, but there's nothing that can put a damper on a date night faster than awful service. Bring the service up to par with the food, and this could easily be a 4-5 star restaurant, between the food and the ambiance. 

But seriously.... if I was rating on service alone it'd be a 1 star... if that.Love love love the red velvet chocolate chip cake. The cake was so moist and packed with flavor. Also, if you love frosting, man oh man, they have cream cheese frosting for days. I found that the cake wasn't too sweet which was exactly what I like in my baked goods. Often time, the sweetness is overpowering and way to much for someone to handle. 

I would say, that their mini, individual cakes are the perfect size to share amongst a couple people. This way you can buy several (reasonably priced) cakes and try and assortment of flavors.

I was very happy that they also had a gluten free cake which is a definitely win win for me. The staff was very helpful and assisted us right away. I can't wait to check out the location here in LA.This was definitely one of my favorite buffets in Vegas...5 years ago.  I feel like the variety is slowly dwindling every single time I come back though.

I like how everything is easy to find and it's not an overwhelming amount of food.  I also like the selection that there still is there but I feel like everything quality wise is slowly going down as well.  I like the chinese food station cause they have one of my favorites, won ton noodle soup.  You just have to ask the sully looking dude standing behind the station to make it.

The gelato is also good too, however you need to flag down someone to serve it to you.Went there for lunch.  Cost was $19.99.

Now lets see ... service was good.  Everything was very clean.  There was a pasta station which is a must for me.  Though it wasn't as big as the one @ the Bellagio.  The pizza was fresh and tasty.  The meats were all pretty dry which was typical.  

These was a seafood bouillabaisse that was really good.  Fried butterflied shrimp good as well.  A variety of cold seafood including ceviche and octupus and shrimp.  

For dessert I had a fruit tart which was great as well.

I don't know how good this place is for dinner but it was A-OK for lunch.  Didn't blow me out of the water buffet wise but it was pretty cheap.

I would go there again if I was on this side of the strip.I used to go to Beauty Bar 6 years ago and before they used to have live gigs all the time. Now its change but thats okay the place is still rocking if you love house music! There only one bar so it can be a wait for a drink, dance floor decent depending on what day of the week you go. Bouncer are real nice and with the right group of people you can really have a good time here.As usual, the food and service is very good here but can you please refinish the floor? It's really showing it age. Worn and discolored, it takes away from the overall experience. The ottomans in the lounge area also need cleaning or even better, reupholstered. 

The place is looking rundown and that's really a shame for a high end, Summerlin dining spot.This was the closes place where my friends and I could come to for a light quick meal, but it doesn't come cheap, but that shouldn't surprise anyone staying or visiting the Wynn/Encore resorts. You order like any other restaurant here, at the counter, they give you a number, you find a seat and they bring it to you. I tried two different things here on my stay in Vegas, first was the Chicken Noodle Soup, the bowl isn't exactly big, almost the size of a campbells or progresso can. The soup is no different than a can soup, salty, but it was piping hot, not bad, but at $5.99, might be best to look somewhere else.
I ordered a cobb salad...lol ya a freaking salad, but it had chicken and bacon, so meh, it was pretty good, expensive for a salad, but like I stated earlier, everything is expensive at the Wynn.I've been meaning to go to the Vig for ages.  i finally got to go on Friday, for a friend's birthday.  We ate elsewhere, then headed over to The Vig for drinks.  It's a beautiful place; atmosphere-wise it's got a great date ambiance.  It was close to 10 when we got there, so it was already pretty crowded, but we headed to the patio that was fairly empty due to the cold.  

It's even more lovely outside.  We huddled around a heater, and I was really absurdly impressed when a waitress came around and offered us blankets.  Very soft, puffy, lovey blankets that I wanted to steal.   Our waitress was pretty rude, though, and had an "I'm way too cool for you" attitude.  I typically don't blame the establishment for that, unless it's ongoing and constant every time I go.   So since it's my first visit, I won't take a star away just yet.

I had been told they had a wicked chocolate martini, so I ordered that.  It was frankly pretty grody.  But that's just a matter of personal taste, and I just won't order it again.  

The problem?  The crowd was soooo not my crowd.  It was all the shiny people from Scottsdale.  I really, really wanted to like it.  I still do.  I will give it a couple more tries, and I am curious how the food is.  

For a night out drinking, final destination-type place?  I'm just not feeling it.  But I bet it's ideal for a lazy day of day-drinking on the patio, once we get our lovely early spring weather.When I came here when I was a kid ten years ago, I thought this was the coolest place. Basically, I was a coke fiend and by that, I mean I was addicted to soda, especially cola. I drank those giant two-liter bottles in one day. The first time I visited, everything was dispensed by fountains. They gave a big tour and explained a lot of the sodas and all the floors were open. At the end of the tour, they let you roam free and try all the different types of sodas from around the world. It was also all you can drink. Knowing this and being the frugal Asians that we are, my dad emptied all our water bottles and we drank until we were full and then loaded up a few bottles of soda in those water bottles. We avoided the nasty soda and loaded up on the ones we liked. 

Oh how things have changed. I came here last spring and now everything is different. The tour is gone and the third floor is completely closed off. They no longer have the soda fountains for all you can drink. Instead, they offer a tastes of the world soda sampler with either 8 or 16 different drinks. Some of the drinks are really disgusting. I'll let you figure out which one it is. Don't try to do the 16 sample challenge on your own. In fact, don't even try it with two people - split it with at least four people. I guess they still have pretty cool Coca-Cola souvenirs and replica vintage items for sale, but like everything else in Vegas, prepare to overpay.We came looking for some leftover fresh natural turkey. I didn't do a Thanksgiving feast and family wanted steaks but I'll be damned if I don't get turkey so I at least wanted to go grab a breast. 

So I got my large turkey breast. 

Veggies didn't look good- organic or conventional.

I gotta go elsewhere (whole foods) for veggies to accompany the meal. This isn't the first time recently where I passed on a veggie, but this time I couldn't find one thing I was happy with. 

I wanted kale and they had 5 kinds, but they were wilting. Green beans- none. Broccoli- no bueno. Cauliflower- meh. 

If I'm in that area and need a few small groceries, then maybe I'll drop on in for things like the sausages or the beauty products but I don't think I'll be making a drive down here to try to do a full menu anymore.I enjoyed my food along with the 50% off from the coupon offered from tix4tonight.  The service was nice, the decor was nice as well.  I'd give this place a 4 if it weren't for the puddle of mush that was my chocolate soufle.  So gross.Clean rooms
Very nice customer service
main pool is beautiful
shuttle service is limited to one stop
rooms looked better in the pictures but were still nice
and hands down most comfortable bed i have ever slept on in a hotel room
 over all it was nice and affordable.Not a big fan... the bar is fairly large with several rooms, though all are pretty dumpy (not so much in the old school "good-dive" kinda way). The crowd is somewhat interesting. Drinks are pretty strong, but smallish. Prices are fair. No smoking patio here - go outside the front door and wave at cars on McDowell while you puff.

I have yet to dine here.

I did see a band play here recently, and that was pretty decent. Without a band - no thanks...Good place as any to go see a movie. The only complaint is that regardless of how many times they say not to use your phone, someone in the audience does not think it applies to them.  

Also one more thing if the movie stars at a certain time start it, we don't need to see full previews that give the entire story line. I felt I saw more than one movie.We like Greek food. This is the best in the area though it is not as good as some in other cities. We came for lunch. My wife had the souvlaki plate which had pork and beef souvlaki, I think as well as some sides on the plate. I had Athenian pasta which was noodles with different cheeses including mithra which I like.  This was very rich and I remembered it later through indigestion. I paid extra for a Greek side salad. It was not well put together compared to others I have had being a lot of lettuce, about 1/8 of a tomato in cubes and one kalamata olive in a place of honor. There may have been some cucumber slices too. Retsina wine is my drink of choice at Greek restaurants. It was ok here. Service was not good.  We waited several minutes to be noticed once seated. The waitress was nice but I hate the excuse of being short staffed as a reason for bad service. I did correct the bill which otherwise would have undercharged us. We will be back though not immediately.Spinning like a grazed bowling pin, I walk, ninety-percent inebriated, over to Mickie Finnz with my girlfriend in tow. After feeling like someone took a cream pie to my soul, I decide to go order the most conspicuously bombastic drink ever. 

A cocktail in a fish bowl.

We decide to order the most fizzy, neon, gut-bleaching drink on the menu. The stuff is mostly comprised of rum and some nondescript energy drink. The server pleads with me to not order the stuff. 

"Um. Don't do this to yourself," she says with biblical conviction. 

"I have to! I have no choice!" I exclaim, the collar of my shirt drunkenly crooked and sticking up like ruffled feathers on a limping pigeon. 

"Whatever, man," I hear from the now indifferent lips of the once concerned server.

The concoction of well spirits, the juicy innards of a popped open can of energy drink, and the distilled hatred of a thousand future memories is swelling in the witch's cauldron of this gigantic fish bowl. My eyes light up; not from excitement but because the color of this drink is so bright. It looks like the green ooze from those Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies.

My girlfriend and I spend the next thirty minutes passing this monstrous thing back and fourth like it was a medicine ball. After we finish the fish bowl we spend the next three days feeling like someone took an ice pick to our frontal lobes. That said, I would definitely recommend playing Russian roulette at Mickie Finnz - but only if someone is with you who will share the agony and regret with good humor.It's not the greatest sushi in the world, but they get points for the extensive menu of specialty rolls. They have an all-you-can-eat option now, and I say take it; you can try a few of the specialty rolls and easily save some money in the process.

You want to sit at the bar when the bald guy is the sushi chef. He's a lot of fun to drink with!Sam's is definitely cheaper compared to Costco and Sam's is more conveniently located as well (Even though I have to admit Costco is nicer). I have been coming here for years and some of the staff recognize me from time to time. Especially Miss Nancy who takes care of the fuel area which I frequent quite a bit. There have been times where the wait to check out has been crazy as they would only have may three lanes open and the lines backed up. So make sure you bring your patience here as people can get a little testy when the lines get long.Sun Asian has an eclectic decor that makes me think of what would happen if a foreign tourist had dinner once in a PF Changs, then tried to re-create it from memory a decade later. It attempts to be trendy but ends up looking like a loft apartment that was well-decorated, then occupied by someone's grandmother who didn't have the best taste. It is at least open and airy, though.

It is a semi-regular lunch spot for me and my co-workers, since it is really easy to get tired of going to Chipotle over and over on the corner of 24th and Baseline, and I refuse to go to Ono Hawaiian Grill. Yuck.

The staff is generally friendly and chipper, if a bit too informal. On a couple of occasions I have had to wait a while to be greeted at my table, but 90% of the time it is a quick in and out lunch.

The food is average-to-decent chinese fare with average sushi and a couple of other asian cuisines thrown in. It is nothing earth-shattering, but it is reliably decent.

I always order the veggies in garlic sauce, but substitute crispy fried tofu. The fried tofu is always well-seasoned and cooked just right. The rice is, let's be honest, mediocre shopping center chinese restaurant rice, but it is perfectly acceptable.

It is a great place to grab lunch for 7 or 8 bucks.I'm not much of a casino guy.  Call me crazy, but I'm not a big gambler...maybe its because I like math and the odds tell me that I might as well flush my money down the toilet (I do bet on football though, but the Giants are easier to pick than putting $100 bucks on 28).  
The casino floor is pretty though, and I'm not one to turn down a free drink so when my step-dad & brother hit the tables; I park myself at a bar, feed one of the video machines the occasional dollar and drink Maker's to my heart's content.  
They've also got a couple decent restaurants...decent, not great, but hey, when you're in the desert, you take what you can get.This one is hard for me since I really like the Takamatsu in Chandler and had a great experience in both Chandler and Tucson.  

I have been to the Dunlap location at least 3 times, simply because it was close and my hubby doesn't eat a lot of sushi.  So, what we usually do is I order sushi and he orders the teriyaki.

The sushi I do have to admit it, is not worth the money at all.  I ordered sushi from the place mat menu and since it doesn't list prices, I thought it would be more reasonable than $12.00 for the small amount of fish that was in my sushi.  I was ok with this place until I went there with a friend who was familiar with their Korean menu.

We wanted to cook the pork ribs ourselves, but the lady said that we had to order two orders, so we didn't.  I had such a great experience doing to cooking at the Chandler Takamatsu that I thought it would be fun again, but oh well.

The ribs came out and it was chewy and the portion for the one order was a lot smaller than the Chandler location.  Even the Tucson Takamatsu had better sushi and food.

I just don't get it about this location?pretty good food especially the green chili(usually) but I can't eat in a dirty place and the floor had food everywhere the last few times we were there. I thought it was just real busy but when it happened over and over even after calling to complain we had to take this place off of our list and we haven't been back in nearly 2 years. The one in Awatukee was the worst for filth. It made me wonder what their kitchens looked like and how many critters were crawling around on the foodWe got a Pain au Raisin and Banana Nut Muffin with 2 coffees.  They were good, but given the expensive price tags, it's only 3stars worthy.  Honestly I've had better pastries.

BTW, you can't charge it to the room because they are not associated with the hotel!  Lame!I found myself in Mesa at the Landmark Restaurant on Saturday for a sorority luncheon. I chose the salad room as my lunch option and it was a great choice on my part. The salad room is a salad lover's idea of heaven...lots of options to pick from ranging from seafood salad to potato salad to pasta salad to mixed greens with tons of toppings. I also saw about five or six soups to choose from as well. The only odd part about the salad room - there was a jar of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies! Here I was trying to be healthy by having the salad room and then they tempt me with cookies?? Agghhhhh! And of course, they got me! The chocolate cake slice that I had for dessert was really good - I'm really not a huge fan of chocolate in general, but this cake slice was not too rich at all and was very moist. Being a good wife, I had the rest of the cake slice boxed up to share with my husband this week.

The decor is dated...I don't think I've seen that much concentration of wallpaper in one place in many many years. Service for our group of 15 was very good - Troy was our waiter and he did a magnificant job. I don't think the Landmark is really a restaurant I would just go dine at, but for the right group, it's a fine choice.Jimmy John's is one of my favorite places around UNLV to grab some food.  They rank on the top of my "fast food sandwich" category, way above Subway, Quizno's, Togo's, or any other mediocre sandwich place.  Their sandwiches are around $5 for an 8" sandwich, which is a great price for a good sandwich.  The service is extremely fast, and the service is friendly, which always makes it easier to come back.  

The sandwiches are what really bring me back, though.  My favorite sandwich is The Vito.  The Vito is a classic Italian grinder, and is one of the most popular things at Jimmy Johns.  I always get the hot peppers, too, which makes the sandwich that much better.  I also really like the BLT, and the Roast Beef and Provolone.  I can't remember what these are called, but the menu's not too confusing to figure out.  

The sandwiches are all made to order, and come out VERY fast.  Usually your sandwich is done by the time you finish getting your fountain drink.  Which brings up another great thing about Jimmy Johns, their fountain drinks.  I usually don't mention fountain drinks as being great, but they have Cherry Coke.  I always like to give props to any restaurant that has Cherry Coke, as it is a rarity, yet is one of the best sodas on the market.  

Definitely go to Jimmy Johns if you love sandwiches, you will love it!Visiting from San Diego and wanted chicken & veggies.   Counter was very disorganized- at least 15 people waiting for food to come out. Finally got to order. Waited 10 min for my food. From where I was sitting could NOT hear them call my order. Food was fresh but cold. Not sure if anyone here knows or cares about customer service.3.5- cheap price and  big portions make you want to come back

It's late (or early depending on how you want to look at it), and my crew and I are fiending for some food.  I'm a big breakfast fan, so I suggest Terrible's.  Since I'm the only one capable of driving, that's exactly where we ended up.

This place isn't too much of a secret.  When we went there, the place was pretty busy, and we had about a 10 minute wait.  Even after we had been seated, it was another 10 minutes or so until we even saw our server.  Once our server was tending to us though, she was super friendly.

The food itself is probably nothing to write home about, but when you're drunk or starving, it really hits the spot.  From 11pm-7am, they have graveyard specials.  My wife and I split the country fried steak and eggs (4.99), while other people in our party got the steak and eggs (5.99), corned beef hash (4.99) and spaghetti with meatballs (under $8).

The portions were more than anyone person can handle (hence the sharing between my wife and I), and for about $30 + tip, I was able to feed 5 people.

If you're not too picky about your food, and want to get your grub on, check this place out.  Oh yeah, this place really isn't too close to the strip, so if you're going to head out here, drive (if you can) or catch a cab.  Cheap good eats, I'm definitely 'bout it.The Pub has, hands down, the best beer selection in Las Vegas.  That said, I am giving it four stars relative to Vegas bars and under the pretenses that I am a big craft beer fan.  Truth be told, most of the staff, save for one man, knew a lick about all the craft beers they had.  And while local stuff like Joseph James drafts were reasonably priced (which was good because that's what I was really looking for), their stock of nicer domestic and imported brews (from things like Chimay to The Bruery) as INSANELY overpriced.  Now, The Pub IS in Vegas, the land of extravagance and entropy but there were a few bottles there that were priced above $100.  As far as I'm concerned, unless it's a bottle of Sam Adams Utopias, it is not worth $100.  And these were like...fairly common Belgian beers we're talking about here.

But, like I said, their local and run-of-the-mill drafts were very affordable and fresh, and there are a lot of those to choose from.

It's tucked way, way in the back of the Monte Carlo, so it was never too busy when we stopped in.  The atmosphere is very pleasant and I imagine it's a great place to watch a sporting event.  There's some reasonably priced pizza fare available, but we didn't really eat much so I can't speak to the full array of food.

So, all in all, it's a really nice bar.  It's quieter and has a great selection if that's what you're looking for.  Which I understand is pretty much not what anyone is looking for in Vegas.  But it's a nice diversion from the ubiquitous chaos on the strip if you're just looking to mellow out for a while.The worst service ever!! Only reason I still come here is because the sushi is so good. But the service pisses me off every time. They forget to bring out wasabi every time. Slow to check up on us. I'd give it a single star but the sushi is the only thing saving it.It's tempting to go to the McDonald's right next to Zoe's but I know my heart thanks me for the missed opportunities.

Zoe's is great to grab a quick healthy lunch. A variety of sandwich options and hot plate options, you'll find something to like. My faves are the egg salad and grilled chicken hot plate. I'm more in love with the rice pilaf than anything else.

The food is not extraordinary. It's just what you expect grilled chicken, greek salad and sandwiches to taste like, except if you order anything with feta, ask for it with LIGHT feta. I have to scoop off the feta when I forget. 

Some say its pricey for lunch and I think its just about right. $8-$12 for lunch is about right. So if you're looking for a healthier alternative, check Zoe's out some time and swing by McDonald's for a soft-served ice cream cone at least.My food was good but my gf ordered an egg salad sandwich w pasta salad and was delivered a tuna salad sandwich with fresh fruit. When they fixed the mistake, there was eggshell in her sandwich. No bueno.Before, I get you annoyed with my "long" blog about this place, lets get to business: 

1) Uncomfortable (the rooms are small including their suits. and the hotel is an out door, making it really hard to navigate on a hot day)  
2) Food & Services is also bad (the room services is slow, and very unpleasant, meaning your meal will taste, look, and feel like Hospital food. your better off ordering pizza. 
3) Customer services is Awesome, sweet, and super friendly. the lady was extremely helpful, professional, and helpful at the Check-in. 


Alright so, we were here for a graduation party (mine) at the University of Phoenix. We decided to stay "30 mins" away from the graduation stadium so we can enjoy the resort. Well, we (4 adults, and 3 kids) had a really bad experience due to its services and the hotel. The place is an out door hotel, it looks and feels like a "Motel" and not so much like a luxury resort HILTON hotel. We've had better experience with Hilton but this place is Pointe Hilton? not sure what that means but it seem like its part division of the Hilton family. 

Anyways, we stayed here for 2 nights and 3 days. They have a coffee inside the hotel which is sponsored by Starbucks. Its not Starbucks, but they use Starbucks coffee. The lady seem always in a Robot mood. Which is not a bad or good thing. 

We also got a Cabana ($80) and enjoyed it. The pools are dirty, harsh to walk and swim in. Their bar experiences and drinks are fast, but tasteless. I was better off making my own drink in my room. Nothing special about their drinks nor worth the money.

Wow alright enough, I really really hate leaving bad reviews, but a place as professional and big like Hilton its a shame to be served and accept this type of experience especially when you are dropping $700 for a 2 day stay.I've really tried to hate this place, can you blame me, I've never seen so many gold diggers with there game face on and dousch bags trying there hardest to rub up on you...but I can't, I always have fun. The drinks  are good, the music is always what it should be and there is a lot to look at.Went for a quick lunch with family last week. The place is always clean and busy. I don't love places like this because they usually only have what feels like a limited menu and quick prep on the items they offer. What they do serve, they do pretty well - albeit a bit on the pricey side. As for the food, I had a big kid grilled cheese with Bacon and Tomato soup. The chocolate chip cookie is a nice touch too. I'd go here again!When it comes to pizza, I'm all about the sauce.  

Boston's has GREAT sauce.

The decor, it's kinda generic.i took my niece ther today for lunch be prepared to part with some cash .I had the antipasta plate which was good,but i have had more creative antipasto elsewhere $16.00 came with olives,caper berries, marinated califlower, 2 meats and a cheese and several slices of toasted foccica  also had a bowl of butternut squash soup which was good $ 9.00 my niece had the muffolatta which look good as well. I also had a glass of wine our server was very pleasant but with a total of 6 people in the place 2 of those were us and i had to wait to get a second glass of wine even though she noticed my glass was empty as she walked by.MEH. 

That's how I felt when I left AZ Wine. 

WOW.

That's what I thought when I entered.

So, what happened once inside? Allow me to explain. 

It was nearly 20 minutes browsing the aisles before somebody popped their head over and said, "You finding everything, Miss?" My reply, "Yes. The difficulty is deciding what to get." Perfect opportunity to strike me up for a convo, no? Perhaps try and sell me the more expensive suggestion, no? Well, he simply said, "Okay." Then he disappeared. Granted, he was setting up for a private affair at the bar area that started in about 45 minutes. But still... Was there nobody else around? Oh well.  I really did want some assistance. After all, it was my 1st time here and there were so, so, so many chioces.

So, I perused the aisles. I wanted to find my fave brands and wine styles to see how much they charged here. That's when I saw some inconsistencies. Example: Row Eleven (Pinot Noir) showed up in 4 different places with 4 different price tags. I looked closely. Same bottle. Strange. This happened more than once, so I was, of course, befuddled. 

I did like how they organized the aisles, even having a Pinot Noir section devoted to California and Oregon wines. They also had a Red Blends aisles and and aisle devoted to Eclectic Whites, including blends, whites you may never heard of, or those you consider new favorites - like Viogners. 

So two thumbs up for how they organize their rows!

I found a bottle of wine I wanted, but it had no price tag. Not even on the shelf. Instead of bother the one-and-only guy working, I just opted not to get it. Sad, huh? 

In comparing prices, I think they are reasonable to most wine stores and less expensive than your upscale markets, like AJ's and Safeway. You can get an Oregon red here for $17 that would cost you $25 elsewhere. Yet, don't be fooled. They do have some really pricey wines - even some topping $100. 

They sell half-bottles. But, if you look at the price, you may decide it's just better to splurge for the entire bottle. 

Plus, they sell wine accessories, even gift bags and stoppers. I liked that, though I didn't need anything except wine. 

I left there with 3 bottles of wine for under $50. Not bad! (Especially considering I tend to buy wines I like that average $20-30 per bottle.) 

If only the service and pricing consistency had been better... 

Yet, since this place is convenient and easy-to-find, I will most likely be back. I'm sort of a DIY wine-chooser anyhow. Plus, I found a couple wines I've only had once that I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to sip and enjoy again - including a Gagliardo. 

Side note: The bar area looked cool. I love the idea of having a wine tasting in the actual wine store. I overheard the guy working saying that if anyone liked the wine, they had them in-stock to sell, and that they would offer discounts, depending on how many bottles you decided to snatch up. 

In the end, though, my WOW turned to a simple MEH. I think it all boiled down to not being acknowledged when I came in and not being engaged in even a short conversation. C'mon, I think wine stores should make the extra effort to talk to customers, since many customers want to explore their options and learn a thing or two while they browse. (Example: "Oh, really? This is what I should serve with my seafood fondue? Awesome.") 

Plus, it makes me 500% more likely to buy more than one bottle when I'm there and 500% more likely to make that store my first-choice store for my wine needs.

MEH. Their loss.I am not entirely certain what went wrong here, but something did.  The lighting was a bit too dark.  The wait staff was a bit too rigid.  The smoke wafting in from the casino was a bit too distracting.

I really wanted to like B&B, but the situation conspired against me.  Granted, I ate what may be the best pork chop of my life there (a bone-in number with a quintz accompanyment), but I didn't walk out happy.  It's as if the restaurant started off on the wrong foot and could never entirely correct itself.  B&B won't crack any Top Ten lists for food on the Strip.  You can find countless other places offering impressive Italian fare for a more reasonable price and in more comfortable surroundings.We came here for dinner last week & had a good time. 

My husband & I split the caprese salad and the beef cheek ravioli. The salad was delicious with some of the best mozzarella I've ever had. The ravioli was also great, but I thought the portion was pretty small. 

Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable at recommending what dishes go well with what wines. 

Music is a bit odd...listened to the entire Doors album during our meal. 

We had good food and excellent service; I just wasn't blown away by anything.No as good as Cleo's in San Bruno, CA - and the salad bar is nothing to rave about, but I've done the tickets for tonight thing, and gotten a decent deal for dinner here.

It's fun - it's not  the best thing ever - but it's fun, and I'm a huge meat eater if I know I have a night of drinking ahead of me - so its an excellent place, if you need that same prospective.

The service was friendly - I will give them that. 

If others want to go on my next trip down in 2 weeks, I'm game.  

mmmmm beef.  lamb. pork.  meat..First timer here and to be honest with you it's just for the sake of a Groupon despite all those 2-3 star reviews.  First of all, the manager Terry (or Terri) was super nice, she even told me how groupon worked from merchants' side and let use use it a day before its "official" valid date (so keep in mind, you'll need to wait for a day after your groupon purchase to use it per rule).  Anyway, we opted for 19.99 Brazilian bbq lunch for two.  The menu said lunch had 7 meat selection, and dinner would have 10.  Let me count the 7 for you in order of our favorite from most to least: Pork loin; spicy chicken leg, non-spicy chicken leg; beef steak (way too raw); sausage; ham; turkey breast bacon roll.  We saw grilled pineapple too.  

Now you can tell how limited the meat selections really are at least for lunch.  I've been to other Brazilian grilles before and always been amazed by how many different stuff we can try, but for this restaurant it's certainly not the case.  The pork loin was tender enough but lack of seasoning in my personal view, the majority of beef chunk should be rated as rare-medium rare at most, I got a bloody plate after having two slices. However you can certainly ask the food servers for more cooked region (very small region though), they are friendly too.  As for the chicken (they did count non-spicy and spicy as TWO selections of meat), well you normally can't go wrong with bbq chicken, and it's just too common/ordinary to judge.

In general, friendly people, nice environment, but mediocre Brazilian grill food, can't say anything about their other menu entrees though.We returned to try lunch again.. with our groupon.  I can say that we had a lovely young lady  Thais as our server and she was great.. like night and day from our first visit.  After the meal I did tell her we had been there before and the service was awful and on this visit we enjoyed our lunch and service.  The drinks were filled without asking and the servers came around a lot and I do mean a lot with the meat offering.
We did order desert, the cheesecake... it was very good and normally we don't get a desert... but again it went back to the great service Thais provided.
We would not go back again though, unless maybe a groupon ( a big maybe).  There are far better Churrascaria in the Las Vegas area than to go on the strip for this one.  Personally I don't think this one will survive.I thought that this place was ok. Nothing amazing as you would think from the amount of people flocking to the restaurant, but its reasonably priced and pretty good. I had the smoked salmon scramble and it was just ok. There were chunks of cream that didnt really get incorporated into the scramble and overall it was just okay. Definitely not something better than I could make at home. 

I guess that overall it is a solid place to grab some breakfast.I went to see the Warhol exhibit, they had a limited amount of pieces.  I'm not sure if they were real or reproductions.  Which puzzled me.  I kept looking close and the numbers next to the name said 2 of 32, so I'm guessing they were special limited repos.  I'm not an art expert or anything I just wanted to see Warhol's work in person.Visiting the Playboy Club courtesy of our visit from Moon, we had heard a lot about this place...how you have to pay cover to gamble here, etc.  

Coming down the escalator and through the first bar, you enter the gambling pit.  Blackjack tables with a minimum of $200 were the first things we spotted on the left.  (Don't worry, there's an ATM right by the pit to help you out should you run out of cash!)  It wasn't that crowded for a Saturday night, a few guys on each table and a couple of tables with no players.  (I felt sorry for these bunnies with no one for them to deal to!)  On the right are more tables and a roulette table with a $25 minimum.  Walking down the center, you get to this area with booths and VIP groups I guess.  And along the back are slot machines(!) and another bar.  On one side of the wall are old movies/videos running of the Playboy enterprise throughout the years.  There's some decent music playing, but you're probably spend more time checking out the bunnies than anyone else.  Of course, it's a sausage fest in here with a few random girls here and there.  

At least I can say I've been to the Playboy Club at the Palms.Went to this restaurant for dinner with the hubby - loved the food but the service could have been better.

 I ordered the sampler of beer which was fun. I always love getting the sampler at Yardhouse and was happy to see they had one here as well. As an appetizer I started with the Ahi poke bowl - it was perfectly dressed and the tuna was super fresh. I always order this dish  anywhere it is on the menu and I can say this was the best I have ever had. I had the mini caprese salad next also fantastic - they used a very creamy mozzarella and it was the perfect portion for a midcourse. For my entree I had the buffalo chicken pizza -super thick crust and a nice drizzle of ranch on top. Not only did it look like a work of art but it tasted fantastic too. 

Now my husband was not as happy with the meal as I was.Ffirst the waitress convinced him not to order the beer battered shrimp that he wanted and talked him into a pulled pork sandwich which he didn't really enjoy. The biggest issue however was the timing of the food delivery. Or salads were brought out before the appetizers were even half way finished and the entrees came out not even 3 minutes later. We were sitting there with 6 plates of food on the table. W e enjoy going out once a week for a "date night" and like to take our time and enjoy our meal. We definitely felt like we were being rushed.

Overall the great food way outweighed the lack of basic service and I would go back again. Next time I'll request to space out the courses.I've got mixed feelings about Seafood City.

What I like: They've got Magnolia Coconut Ice Cream Bars. Sure other Asian stores have them, but their are always in stock and reasonably priced. They usually have a goodly amount of steamed cheesecake onhand. I love this little Japanese dessert because it is nice and light and not too sweet. I don't have to make a separate purchase at Red Ribbon cause they have the mamon sponge cake in store as well. And lastly my mom usually finds all her beloved Filipino ingredients.

What I dislike: It's crowded. Ugh. The store is always packed. I don't think I have ever been there at a time when it wasn't filled with people. If I wanted to willingly subject myself to agoraphobia I'd just go to Walmart on a Saturday at 10 a.m.  And the parking lot is crowded as well. Sometimes I feel sorry for those people who just want to go to Jason's Deli. And of course the smell. Sometimes I can ignore it or it's not too bad, but other times the fish smell is overwhelming.

All in all, this is a great place if you are shopping for Filipino foodstuffs. I usually only get over to it if I am on a shopping trip with my mom. I think one of the biggest draws for me is visiting Chow King for a mango shake - but that is an entirely different review.The first time I came here it was the perfect cure for the morning hangover and portions were perfect. Recently, I returned hoping for the same great experience and it was extremely disappointing. I didn't try the sandwiches but the pho was less than satisfying. I got the combo special and felt like the portions were literally cut in half and I didn't see any tripe. I was lucky enough to get half a meatball! I would come back but next time I'm gonna pay 7 bucks for the large bowl. Shrimp rolls were bomb though.I have to agree with Hiro 100%, this place smelt very funny definitely a cigeratte smell probably from the bar two doors down. But the smell alone will make this my second and last visit here.

But I still think they deserve three stars because the food was fairly good. Had a order of fresh spring rolls and pho both very tasty, but I can't get over to smell to find it in me to come back.I was a few minutes late to be picked up by Sunrise Cab and taken to Sky Harbor on a recent Friday morning otherwise this would be a solid five star review.

As others have mentioned these old-school 1980s cabs can be seen roaming the Central Phoenix streets and avenues -- but you don't see them much in other parts of town although they serve the entire Valley.

Regardless, the cabbie was nice, a little rough looking, told me about his sexual conquest the night before with some barflys at Philthy Phils.  Taxicab Confessions, anyone?

He also explained that Sunrise is much cheaper than Discount, Yellow and AAA, much better to work for than they are - and that they are the preferred cab service of Phoenix's gay bars.  

Friendly cabbie, not so prompt service, a typical $20 cab ride that was $13.  3.5 stars for Sunrise.There clothing is a 5. However, at this location the service was horrible. I couldn't find someone to help me get something down, no one asked if we needed anything, the two girls were behind the counter and too busy talking to themselves and ignoring the customers. Usually this chain has great service. I was very disappointed in this location.I just had to up this Starbucks one more star because the surly dude who works there isn't half as bad as I previously described him.  He is just who he is... a little curt, but also kind of funny in a Joe Pesci-kind-of-way. And, I am thrilled to say that I L-O-V-E their seasonal Carmel Apple Spice drink! It is delicious! 

But, in all honesty, I still can't give any Starbucks more than three stars. Yes, I go there for an occasional mocha or seasonal drink, but they are soooo overpriced, and their coffee is just not that great. The hype of Starbucks bothers me, but I'm a sucker for branding, so I guess I'm a hypocrite. Oh well.Nice Gym, friendly staff.The food here is so so. It bar food, cant be *too* picky about it.

Lots of TVs- awesome.

My only real complaint is that, who I can only assume was one of the managers, was walking around w/ a halter dress on that showed way too much cleavage (not to mention the pen she had sitting in it). Theres a time and a place for outfits like that. That time and place is *never* a place that has a kids menu IMO.Water's Edge is an upscale restaurant in the bottom floor of a non-descript office building just off the main drag in Fountain Hills, Arizona.  The restaurant enjoys a very pleasant view of the famous fountain and lake.  The interior was dimly lit and in keeping with what you would expect from a restaurant serving contemporary American cuisine.

Menu offierings weren't especially innovative - but they had all the basics.  I ordered the pear salad, which was disappointing.  Most of the salad's components were chopped so fine that there was little concentration of flavor.  I usually stay away from seafood when in desert locales, but I ordered the scallops, which were perfectly cooked and served over a risotto, which had a nice, mild flavor.  The bread (always the mark of a truly fine restaurant) was also disappointing and may even have been a frozen, bake and serve roll.  The service was friendly, but uneven and, it seemed, not especially well trained - which is surprising since I was attending a business dinner there with the restaurant's owner.  

Overall, I was pleased with my experience (probably because the scallops were so good) - it is clearly the finest restaurant in Fountain Hills.  With a little fine tuning, attention to detail and some creativity, it could be a whole lot better.Wanted a quick sandwich to split with my wife. We had just been shopping in the strip mall and saw this restaurant. With the tinted windows, couldn't really tell if it was  open.
Ordered the Southwestern Club which was made with fresh bread. My wife enjoyed it, but for me I really didn't care for the raspberry honey mustard. It just didn't knock my socks off. My wife enjoyed it, so we'll be back to try something different.I've been to several ZIPP locations.  ZIPPS has great food.   This restaurant is lacking consistency. Soggy fries and onion rings. A kids hamburger that looked like it was chunks of left over meat.  3 stars because I know what they can do, just hope they overcome the problems they have had at this location.I tried the lobster burrito it was good not great, The beans not too good , next time I will just get the burrito. Kinda pricey 32$ for 3 people.A great little sports bar with cheap drinks and a very nice patio. Free pool although the tables are a bit beat up but playable. The food is ok but stay away from the big game day specials... there is a reason the hot dog is 75 cents.

Spuds used to have more entertainment such as Big Buck Hunter and arcade bowling. Sadly all there is now is Golden Tee.

I would give Spuds a four because I like small sports bars, have been a patron for years and the staff is very good but with the recent loss of the arcade entertainment and the fact that if you want to hear something other than yourself you have to put $$$ in the juke box it gets knocked down one.People say Wingstop is so great, but I went to this one, and I'd have to say I don't get it.  Neat decor with the oldschool flight theme, and cozier less terribly noisy environment than BWW.  Wings were large and meaty.  But sauces just weren't very interesting.My fiance stumbled upon this lil place this weekend, and we are all about mom/pop shops, so thought this was a must. All I can say is it was decent.

We were there around 9:30ish on a Sat morning, and while it was definitely packed (it's a tiny place afterall) we still only had to wait like 5 minutes, so not bad at all. We sat outside and the atmosphere was great. Cool weather, shade, good smells, birds, definitely enjoyable. 

Our waitress was nice, but could tell she was really busy. Took her while to even get to us. The other servers seemed to be helping out everyones tables, since we had 3 different waitresses refill our coffee. Didn't bother me at all though, I'd rather have multiple people helping than one that's not.

This is where my review gets so-so - the food, which for a restaurant, is not a good thing. I ordered the Eggs Benedict (one of my faves anywhere I go) and my fiance got the Country Fried Steak (one of his faves). 

Mine was alright, but for almost $10, nothing to write home about. The servings were a bit small (hardly any hashbrowns), again, dissapointing for the money. There was something off with the taste. I know they make their Hollandais sauce themselves, so maybe this was it. Also, most Eggs Benedict I get usually have a runny yolk when you cut into it, this one was more solid.

My fiance's Country Fried Steak was also lacking. Normally the gravy will have a spicy sausage in it, however they use sweet sausage. It wasn't terrible, but just tasted different and again not really memorable.

So all in all, cool quaint atmosphere, friendly service, so-so food, average/above average prices.Hot wing sauce hot and suicide are hot. It will affect your bowel movements if you aren't use to it. Suicide is sour, lots of black char in the sauce, and spicy. Hot is hot and with good flavor. Prefer hot over suicide any day. I usually ask for a side of the sauce.
The side salad is a pretty good size.
The pizza is described as thin and crispy. It was thin, but no crispy. Was not pleased.
Service, a little slow and when you need someone they are no where to be found.Southwest has been my go to for flying any ware. I just have one issue,  give us some more roasted peanuts!!!  ^_^


-Cheers-.FREE PIE!!! The siren call of all seniors within a 50-mile radius. Avoid Wednesdays, which are FREE PIE days! That said, the dinner was just okay, like someone else said, "Denny's". So this is the place for you if you like excessively salted food. The good thing is that they give you big glasses of water and plenty of it. In all fairness it's clean and the service was great. Just not five-star, or even four-star dining.The best turkey burger ever. The food is always good here a wonderful verity of burgers and of course bottomless fries if that is your thing.
I would not recommand going durning busy times the place is a little crazy.The K BBQ here I've found to be quite tasty but the service has been pretty hit-or-miss. I think I've been 4 times and 2 of those times the service was pretty darn rude. 

The last time my date and I just ordered one thing because in the past we totally over ordered. Our server gave us that snide look that implied, "That's *all* you're getting?" That's how both of us interpreted it anyway and she didn't pay us much attention the rest of our meal, even though there was only 2 other tables of people in the entire restaurant. 

Also, our meat has burned on 2 occasions because the waitress waited too long to come and flip the meat. I wish I would have just flipped it myself so I didn't get those little badly charred bits in my Korean BBQ. The food is pretty good but I don't think I'll be back.Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):
7 Food
7 Service
8 Atmosphere
6 Value

The atmosphere could have had an extra boost to a 9 if the storefront was more accessible to pedestrians and if they hadn't for some unknown reason had the garagedoor-style wall raised on a warm and very humid day on my last visit, making it uncomfortable on the inside.

Otherwise I find the interior to be pretty special.

And other-otherwise, I find this place vastly overrated by all my friends, but still worthy of a solid but not special 3-stars.  The food is good but doesn't blow me away (for the prices and hype).  There are a few (7) very unique and pretty tasty cocktails (e.g. almond margarita, Aperol Spritz) but I'd like to see a few more on there because I feel like they have what it takes to make a really interesting cocktail menu, even if it probably wouldn't be my favorite.  This hypothetical expanded cocktail menu could then become the draw for me.

Light-Railable: Yes
Pedestrian Friendly: NoNot a big fan of the Boba Tea House by Lee Lee. I like their decor, very hip. However, their milk tea mix was not that great. It felt like basic sugared water. I've had better ones over in Lollicup or Quickly in LA. It's a pretty busy location as it is next to Lee Lee's, but unfortunately they definitely aren't quite there yet with the competition.good service, but food was just mediocre. tried the seafood tofu soup, the yook gae jjang, and the dol sot bi bim bap. all were decent, but just nothing extraordinary. the "extra spicy" tofu soup was not spicy enough and the bi bim bap lacked in some of the traditional ingredients. side dishes were good, but once at this place was enough for me.Pretty good stuff.  Get the #1-the original and don't forget the onions and the whiz!  Employees were personable.  Food was fast and hot.  Nice, casual setting.Do yourself a favor and have your pizza delivered. The location is sketchy at best, but they have decent pizza and excellent prices.  Barro's doesn't skimp on sauce or toppings.  The cheese bread sticks are awesome, as are the dessert bread sticks....so I have been told. ;)  Delivery is quick and they get the order right.  That makes Barro's A-OK with me!Pizza was reasonably priced and okay tasting.  It is nice to try somewhere exclusive to AZ.  The restaurant itself is nothing to look at but I'd likely go here again.For a local place, not too far from home, Nicks Italian works. I love their salads, especially for lunch. Pizza deal is great too. I have to be honest though, the past few times we called for "to go" orders, they never say THANK YOU and or a GOODBYE just the phone hanging up on us. I mean, come on! We're spending OUR money at your business and you can't even treat us with some gratitude when we place an order to go, especially when there are other restaurants competing for business???

O.k., there is my rant.

I'll come back for lunch but I am saying goodbye to "orders to go" only because you all are not very pleasant on the phone.

I really do hope a manager reads this and fixes this problem, STAT.Nello's is an excellent place to just kick back and relax especially on Art Walk night or in the midst of similar activities in old town Scottsdale, they also offer the lure of live music on Tuesday and Saturday nights. 

My favorite appetizer pizza combo thus far is the eggplant bruschetta and the pizza rustica with a small river of Kilt Lifter steadily flowing to my table. The pizza is thoughtfully done, always tasty, and the ingredients always seem to be very fresh. 

While I've been pleased with their desserts I would rather walk to the Sugar Bowl next door and hazard 10,000 ankle biters to get a good old fashioned ice cream sundae or banana split.

Event calendar for music:
http://www.nellosscottsdale.com/wine_dinners_group_events/It was our last evening in Scottsdale and we were sick of the turrible Mexican food.  We stumbled across this place in old town Scottsdale and it was everything we were looking for - reasonable prices, no wait, and food you can't go wrong with.  We ordered the pan pizza with a few toppings, side salad, and 2 beers.  Our total came out to about $30!  
I don't remember our waitresses name but she was super sweet, friendly, and fast.  
You can't go wrong here.Good Morning Y'all!  It's breakfast time!  Wake up sleepy head and let's go to the Farm at South Mountain for some Morning Glory, ie good breakfast.  

Morning Glory is one of 3 restaurants on the Farm at South Mountain.  As you may have guessed, this is the restaurant that serves breakfast.  I bring all my out of town guests here that like to get up and have a nice breakfast.  The atmosphere can't be beat.  All the seating is outdoor/patio seating.  When you are sitting back there, you completely forget that you are sitting in a farm in the middle of Phoenix!

I usually order lite breakfast items like a couple eggs and a toast, but I've tried the French bread there and I enjoyed it.  My friends have all enjoyed their meals as well.  I also enjoy their coffee.  

For the novice, you will find Morning Glory all the way at the end of the drive onto the Farm.  I would recommend parking in the spaces at the end of the drive instead of using the parking lot just east of 32nd St.  You can take a walking tour around the section of the organic farm adjacent to Morning Glory.  There's a chicken coop right there and you can see some of the produce.  The green house to the east of the chicken coop.  And you might find that the artist's studio is open that day, it would be west of the chicken coop.

The patio seating is friendly to dogs, but don't take your dog beyond the perimeter of the restaurants.  Maya's farm is an organic farm and you can't take dogs in the area where the plants are growing!  Watch out for the signs that warn you if you bring your pooch to b'fast with you.

Morning Glory is a solid option for breakfast.  I especially like to invite visitors there for breakfast.  You will like it too.  Trust me.Always solidWe ordered half Hawaiian half Chix bacon ranch. The guy taking the order over the phone had some trouble. We asked for no BBQ sauce but it came with. The pizza was large, bursting with flavor and tasted fresh. I wouldn't call this true NY pizza however.. The crust was pretty doughy and not traditional thin and crispy. The prices were decent. A good value right off the strip.I like Homegoods for the knick knack stuff and some homeware but both times I've visited I get overwhelmed by the clutter... I try really hard to find something to buy because it seems like a great deal, but I've been unsuccessful. 

I would go back only if I knew exactly what I need. This is not a place to browse because you would buy a lot of stuff and come home with things that don't work with your decor at home, unless your home looks like Homegoods, Ross or Marshalls.Writing an update for Freed's Bakery. The owner Max has been very responsive after my bad experience on 5/3/13. He has gone leaps and bounds to help me get the cake I need for my son's party. I will write another update after the party on how the cake was................................that's if anybody see's it. Seems like my original review was blocked since it no longer shows up when I look for it. Had to actually go under my profile to find it. Very interesting Yelp.I went there for lunch during my last trip to LV.  The environment is pretty nice, and the decoration is modern, but the service is kind of slow even though there weren't too many customers when we were there.  We ordered the lunch combo from their lunch menu.  The food is just ok.  Everything is just on the average level, but I was expecting it would be better given the price they charge.  So overall, this is not really a place you must try in Vegas.Eh, it had it's good and bad qualities. In the mist of my bar hopping I came across this place. Keep in mind that I've actually never eaten crab before. Oh yes, this gets stupid.

When I first walked in I wasn't given a greeting, I'm assuming cause they probably thought I was some middle school kid that wandered in lost. The spiderman backpack I had probably didn't help. Oh well, my problem. 

I pop a squat up at the bar, away from some obnoxious other patrons. That's right, I knew they were obnoxious the first 5 seconds I walked in. Kinda sat their awkwardly for four minutes. The other two bartenders ignored me. Thought I was waiting for mommy to finish her beer perhaps? Most likely. Could have asked though, you big jerks!

 Finally a young lady came out and greeted me with a menu, I already had my ID ready (good job following the law!) and after a few minutes I ordered a beer and the crab bucket with a mix of the two types. One, cause I don't know the difference and decided if I'm going to fuck this up, I'm going to completely 100% fuck everything up!

They brought me out all the wrecking tools used to annihilate the crab legs, and I had no idea what to do. I played creeper and watched the guy a few seats down from me work his magic and then just tried to copy him. Could have I asked the waitress? Don't boddle me with your logic!

While it was good, I must say crab is not my thing. I'm one lazy ass bitch and sitting there for half an hour to get a handful of meat is not on my to-do list, but might be a good way to starve off the fat bastards we have on our planet. Seafood for everyone!I really want to like this place, it has so much going for it. The ventilation needs to be increased to reduce the significant amount of smoke insideI am usually very generous with my ratings but I had a horrible first experience with this practice. I had set up a prenatal appointment with Dr Carey and the soonest they had was about 2 weeks out, so I scheduled it, got the confirmation message the day before reminding me of my appointment, and then I show up at the office and the girl at the front says, oh we left you a message yesterday and this morning to reschedule because Dr. Carey won't be in today. I informed her that I did not receive any such message, and she speaks to her co-worker and turns out the associate that was supposed to call and reschedule me didn't do it. I understand things happen, and especially at a pediatric practice but she didn't really even apologize or try to find a solution. Instead she just says "well I don't know Dr. Carey's schedule for the next two weeks so I'll have to call you to reschedule". This is absolutely ridiculous. First off, I am due any day so the whole point of me waiting that 2 weeks to get in to see her and establish her as my doctor was so that this would be taken care of before I have the baby. Secondly, how is this kind of customer service acceptable? I have read nothing but great things about the Dr, but unfortunately the staff is a huge representation of the physician. I have still yet to hear back from the office to reschedule my appointment, so I am instead going to find another pediatrician who's office staff is polite, professional, and treat people and their time with respect.

I updated this review due to the fact that office rescheduled me, (because I called them and reminded them they hadn't done so yet) and I just saw Dr. Carey today and she is awesome. Such a nice lady, really took her time with me and I will be coming back here when my baby is born/ The front office is something to be desired, especially at a pediatric office but Dr Carey is worth the first bad experience.We've never eaten inside and always order to go over the phone. I like it. Their spicy rolls are among my favorites, but my wife isn't into spicy at all. They have tons of different kinds of California rolls. 

Price varies from cheap to expensive depending on how many rolls you get and what kind of rolls they are.I love Ross. I buy all my kids clothes here and I like getting stuff for my home here to. There was a large vase on the top shelf in the home section that I was afraid I could not get down without some help from the store. I asked 3 employees for help and they all said its not their department. I was so frustrated I finally left. I hope the Ross up the street has the same item and better staff!This place is expensive. So expensive that I just don't go anymore. However, the food is noteworthy.

The advertised falafel sandwich is the only thing I'll get, when I feel like I have some cash burning a hole in my pocket for one of the cheapest foods to make ever. It is plainly delicious. The pita, right off the bat, is spectacular. Thick on one side, thin on the other, and it just soaks up the tahini sauce poured all over the interior perfectly. The salad tossed over the falafel and stuffed inside is also delicious. Everything is just right. It's honestly the only item worth it on the entire menu for the price... sort of.

Everything else isn't bad. Their grilled meats are tasty, but expensive. The chicken shawarma is dried out and tired, and expensive. The service is acceptable, if you can call it service. Location is convenient if you're in that part of town. I mean, really, why else would you be there?

Did I mention it's expensive?Good Place to grab lunch! 

Went here for lunch on Thursday and it was pretty empty.... we sat at the bar because I wanted to play video poker. 

We ordered chicken wings to start... good and meaty.  Would definitely order these again with a beer next time. (It was lunch time so I stuck to a soft drink.)

I had the California Wrap with the upgraded Onion Rings.  (I had asked for the mayo sauce to be on the side....but they didn't get that right... however, I wasn't going to make a stink about it.... but that's why they didn't get a 4-star review.)

The wrap was fantastic!  The chicken was warm, the avocado was ripe and creamy.... the sprouts added a nice texture and crunchiness that I totally dug... and it had bacon... and everything is better with bacon.  It was also big enough that I only ate 1/2 of it and took the other half home.

The onion rings were great too... big and not greasy.  And the breading was not over powering....meaning there was actually onions in the onion rings.

The husband had the chicken chopped salad and while I didn't get to taste it... it didn't look all that appetizing... it was really blank looking.

Since this place doesn't get slammed like other places for lunch, is reasonable and has a good menu... I know we'll be back.This Fedex Office is not really an office, it is more like a copy center in a closet. 

Fedex bought out Kinko's several years ago, and slowing started changing the name, from Kinkos, to Fedex Kinkos, and for the past year, Fedex Office. 

They clip fliers on your shipping receipt that let you know you can have Fedex pack your shipment, too. Value Added services is the name of the game, to increase revenues for these mostly 24 hour convenience business centers. 

I use Fedax a lot. Perfer them over UPS, because they still have way bills you can fill by hand and charge it to a corporate account. UPS stopped that because of too much fraud. Will Fedex be next?

This Fedex was hard to find in the big box strip mall it was in. Look hard or ask someone where is it, like I did.Prices are a bit high out here, but bartender assured me that they have restaurant quality food here. Some of the choices were unique and I ended up with the Turkey Jo. This had thin sliced roasted turkey drenched in way too much tangy BBQ sauce, but was loaded with carmelized onions and then topped with a small scoop of cole slaw. Sandwich was too soggy, despite the toasted bread. Some strange side dish which was like fried mac and cheese almost. Unusual, but not that great. Plenty of beer choices and mostly locals here make this place a decent option if your in the neighborhood.Friendly, efficient service in a local joint that serves up decent food. The upside to this place is that it's not a chain and you're not required to walk into a casino for a meal. The downside is that the menu isn't as creative as one might hope in a place that has so much potential.

You can get your standard waffles, pancakes, eggs Benedict and crab cakes too. Expect to see some gray-blue hair which goes well with the grandma-esque decor. Yes... some would argue this looks like a quaint restaurant from New England, but I'm not feelin' it. It reminds me more of a New Jersey restaurant by the side of a highway I once went to that had a coffee clache every Sunday afternoon.

On our first visit, I had the vegetarian Benedict and was unimpressed with the hollandaise sauce. It needed a little zest because it seemed rather flat to me. My BF had the biscuits and gravy and said the gravy tasted like a mix. I don't know about that but I don't think they gave us nearly enough.

Again, this place has good service and decent food. It's just going to be disappointing for someone coming from San Francisco, NYC, Boston, New Orleans, or Chicago. Y'all have many more options than we do for great breakfast/ brunch spots.We had booked a two night stay at The Venetian.  It had an offer where, as part of our stay, we could pay $30 a day and receive two passes per day to the spa, along with other discounts to its restaurants and the wax museum.  Since a regular day pass to the spa alone is $35 per person, I thought the offer was a good deal.  We received passes for three days that were good from the time the spa opened early in the morning until it closed at 10pm.  

Prior to our arrival, I perused the spa's services and schedule of fitness classes.  I'm not a huge fan of spas.  I've had different treatments at various spas as part of a girl's spa day but was never convinced that they are worth the price.  Though I enjoy an occasional facial, I thought  Canyon Ranch's treatments were much too rich for my blood.  However, after reviewing the schedule of fitness classes, I was impressed by the variety of classes Canyon Ranch offered.  So on the next morning after we arrived, I dug myself out of bed to attend a 9am mat pilates class and a 10am spin class.  

While I thought Canyon Ranch's facilities were nice, they were not as plush and palatial as I had heard and expected.  It was no different than the local Burke Williams or Glen Ivy I've patronized and I was disappointed that Canyon Ranch's showers did not have my favorite -- overhead rain showerheads.  And after taking both fitness classes, I was underwhelmed by those offerings.  I did not think either instructor was particularly good or inspiring.  The pilates instructor was late and had to be hunted down.  She only went through some basic pilates moves.  I've taken a number of spin classes at my gym and know that spinning can be only as good as your instructor.  The instructor at Canyon Ranch was downright boring.  The class was not cued to any specific music and all the instructor did was tell us when to stand or sit and when to adjust the knob.  Pretty lame.  

For what we paid, the spa was a decent deal.  But I wouldn't do it if I had to pay full price.I love middle eastern food! Love their chicken breast kabob, tabbouleh and hummus! Definitely worth the visit! Huge servings! I would have given this a 4 star rating but the service is very slow.Chuck E Cheese sure has changed from when I grew up with it as a kid in the 80's but so has everything else right? It seems many places have just gone down hill in every aspect from when we were younger.

The machines are tighter than a ticks ass in giving tickets, they eat up tokens and give you very little in return. I was smart and went to the Company website and printed out a 100 tokens for $20 coupon. 

They always have internet coupons, I never pay full price for tokens when I take my nephew there for fun. The prize selection in which you redeem the tickets for is an even bigger joke! Most of this junk is dollar store or quarter machine worthy and breaks before you step foot off of the property. They could do a lot better for the kids and get some decent prizes. I could have taken my nephew to the dollar store and given him the 20 bucks to spend and he would have walked out with 20 toys that are way better than Chuck E Cheese. Instead for 440 tickets he walked away with a flimsy straw, a plastic bracelet, and tiny plastic blow up guitar. Very lame for all of the tokens used up!

Many of the machines were broken, eating tokens and not returning anything so I had to call over employees a few times to fix machines or reimburse lost tokens.

We eat before we go, $20 bucks for a small pizza no better than frozen, I don't think so.Previous Ihop frequenter, but this particular Ihop's food was bland.  The pancakes were soggy, the hash browns were soggy, and the bacon was not as crispy as I am used to. Overall, not very appetizing. I should have ate at a casino buffet for the same price.Typical golf course fare.  Nice if you live in Summerlin.No different than a normal CPK.  Grabbed a later night pie and ate it in the room.  Went BBQ Chicken, their specialty.  Good as always.

Good service and food came out fast.  Another bonus for the Mirage.I tried this restaurant a few weeks ago and am writing from memory. That being said I went to this restaurant based on reviews. I have to admit I was let down in ways. The decor is better than I had expected, for some reason I thought it would be extremely causal aka Roberto's causal. The prices seem a bit steep for what you received. I enjoyed the variety on the menu and found it interesting that they served raw lamb.  I was disappointed when we asked for an eggplant dish after studying the menu judiciously and was told that they did not have that dish and that "eggplants were hard to come by" which is news to me. They served some sort of puffed bread which I found unusual and enjoyed. The quality of the food was good, not outstanding or even that memorable, but good enough that if I were in the neighborhood and they had a special I may come back. I believe the review I read for this restaurant recommended the baby eggplant appetizer - I tried this and it was different, which I can appreciate.This is a very pretty atmospheric place with great service.  The food was okay, nothing to  write home about but passable.  The bruschetta is a really nice appetizer, although it apparently was inconsistent from one time to the next, as my out of town relatives were disappointed that the bread seemed to be different from their previous visit. Nonetheless, it was quite tasty.  The Tiramisu dessert unfortunately really missed the mark...I've had much better and it didn't taste at all of coffee or any type of liquor, more like caramel or something.  So, that was the main downpoint.  Eggplant parmesan was okay, could have used a bit more seasoning as the eggplant flavor didn't come through in the dish itself, but hey, it was still good, a large portion (for me anyway), served hot and fresh..... and for the blend of atmosphere and very attentive service you get here, you could do worse than coming to The Grotto for dinner.  If I came back would try other things on the menu, maybe the pizza, as I'm sure there are some stand outs that are quite good.  Have fun! You won't be disappointed in this place unless you're looking for top of the line Italian...it's an enjoyable overall place to hang out, especially for out of town friends and family.  (the fish tank and waterfall/pool  area while a bit noisy is all part of the action and fun of Las Vegas!Went to see The Expendables tonight.  Line to get in moved fast. kudos to the mgr for staffing.  As expected, popcorn and a drink would have bought 2 more tkts.  The popcorn tasted bagged, burnt, with only a ration of fake butter.  Geez, if they're gonna gouge you, it could at least be tasty!  On the upside, the theater was relatively clean and free of debris.  It was a little too warm inside until the ac clicked on as the movie trailers began (so visitors, you'll be just fine wearing shorts into the movie in the summer). After watching a decent action packed movie stallone style, found the visit to the restrooms surprisingly clean and stocked with automatic soap and fans instead of paper for hand drying.  I know it's all about the big screen and seeing 1st run movies, but I can make awesome popcorn at home and enjoy it over and over on demand alot cheaper than 50 bucks.If you are in Vegas and need to find Japanese merchandises then this is the place to visit! A narrow long shop crowded with various imported items. Yes the prices reflect this but what do you expect? It's exprensive to import things. Good for all your bento supply needs, including rice molds, cut out shapes and cute little bento lunch boxes. They also have a nice selection of anime items and plush including lots of hello kitty.  If you like kawaii this is the place to be.

Oh yes and one more thing...they have real melon pan! (japanese melon bread) so if you've ever wanted to sample what Rin religiously eats in DearS, then this is the place to find it!

The hungry kitten says -  find fresh mochi and onigiri in the back fridges!Capistrami great as always. 

The service end... No friendly greeting, basically ignored for 5 minutes until they even ask if I needed to order. And no, it wasn't busy at all. The older man named James, who seemed to be in charge, rang me up while refusing to take my $3 off survey code cause it was from another store. Doesn't say anywhere on there it has to be used at the same store, and I've been allowed to do it at other stores. Guess I'll be avoiding this location. 

Also, the employees usually say thanks out loud when tipped... Either they didn't get tipped the entire time while I ate my sandwich there or they're just not appreciative of our business.Really should be 2.5 stars. The service was pretty bad, long waits for drinks, to order, for food, for the check, etc. The food was decent. I had a grilled chicken sandwich and it was pretty good, my boss had the fish and chips and hers were just ok as well. I have never watched Star Trek in my life, basically just was staying at the hotel and wanted to eat somewhere close. For people into Star Trek, I'm sure it would be much better, but they definitely need to work on their service regardless.I thought this place was okay...I was brought here with the 4-star rating, but I'll give it 
3 stars...I had the chocolate custard, which was good and creamy, but really didn't have as chocolaty a flavor as  would have liked.  It also seemed a bit too sweet compared to other custard shops.

The interior is cool...it has a cool retro feel and I really appreciate that.It was good, but a lot of oils and sauces. I really want to find raw veggies. Not cooked, greasy wanna be meat substitutes, might as well go to McDonalds.I had the Pecan French Toast and my partner had the Garden of Eden omelet.  We enjoyed the food.  The facility was well done.  The service were somewhat subpar. We waited for a while for for our drinks and the check took forever to be cashed out.  The place gets annoyingly packed  during breakfast and brunch.  I will definitely go back there and try other menu offerings.I used this company for 2 rides (one to a place and one home), one way was great, the other was not, so i averaged them to a 3 star rating.

I was in vegas for a bachelorette and we booked limos to take us to and from a pole dancing class (highly recommended, see Pole Fitness).  On the way there, our limo arrives (not the stretch hummer I was told i was going to get but whatever) and we noticed it was a million degrees inside...the driver for some strange reason had the heat BLASTING in the back and our controls wouldn't work to shut it off.  it was 95 degrees out, why he had the heat on is beyond me.  it seemed he didn't know how to shut it off either, until finally after about 10 minutes he figured it out.  Also, the radio/ipod hook up would not work at all and he didn't even apologize for that.  He dropped us off and peeled out before we could even say thank you.
We were kinda worried for our ride home, but this time, a huge stretch hummer pulled up with music bumpin, and fun lights in the back (and AC working THANK GOD) - exactly what you want for a bachelorette.  Our driver was so wonderful, helped us all in and out of the limo and genuinely wished us a fun night as we left.
So i guess we had an overall good experience, just depends on the driver you get which is too bad for the company.The sin city budget car rental experience was not too shabby.  The highlights included:
* Immediate and expedited service!  No else was in line on a Wednesday morning.  
* Swift check-in service.
* Nissan Versa car rental!  Nice car with great MPG.

The only negative was the attempted up-sell for insurance.  The agent was being negative about all the things that could happen.  I know there's always that possibility; however, I'm on vacation with a positive mindset!  If the rate at Avis is too high then Budget Car Rental is my choice.Starving, tipsy and needing a place to rest my sore tootsies, I headed to Hennessey's with my group last night. In costume, I might add. 

We located a spot on the patio for the best spot to people watch. Service was friendly, albeit incredibly SLOW given how not so busy the place was. Drink orders were mixed up and our large order of french fries took about 45 minutes to come out. 

Great location and typically when I come the service is much better, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that the Halloween crowd slowed them down a bit. 

Definitely a good little place to take a seat and rest with a beverage or some pub grub while you're downtown. People watching from the patio is a plus!Did i go to the wrong place? all the great reviews & then....meh!!!!
The quality was decent, definitely not the best ive ever had...good, but for the price there are better spots in the valley.
i appreciate that its a small female owned business & we may stop back by - but i definitely wasnt feeling the love like so many others.Overpriced and not exactly authentic if you've had pho in a Vietnamese place, BUT it's good. Not the good where I will go out of my way to have it, but the good where if I want pho after a night out on the strip, I will come here. 

It's about $13-$14 for a bowl of pho, about double the price I find in San Jose. There is not as much meat, and it doesn't taste as authentic. 

I got the beef stew, and the pho noodles they used were not the typical ones that Vietnamese places uses. The meat was dry but the soup itself was pretty good. 

Portions are pretty big, but be ready to spend when you get here!!I really wanted it to be awesome, because I work nearby this bar...the happy hour spot with coworkers. But, I have been here at least 5 times and I hate to say it, but the service is always less than average. I always felt like I was waiting on the server. The food is pretty decent though; I give it three stars based on the above average bar food. I have had every thing from the salads to the sandwiches to the burgers and they are all very good! The Office generally has decent drink specials as well and lots of TVs for sporting events. Bottom-line if you want drinks and some eats and you have time to wait, The Office is the place to go if you are in this neighborhood.I really wanted this place to be better.  The Casino and Lobby are awesome.  It actually has design instead of a cheesy "theme".  The basic rooms are too basic and poorly laid out.  There is one outlet in the room to use, no towel racks in the bathroom, crappy TVs and alarm clocks.

Friends had a panoramic room and although is was better, it was poorly laid out with lots of wasted space.  I was also shocked at how dirty the hallways were.  Nothing was vacuumed the three days I was there.

I'd go back only for a good deal.Great, central location. The view from our room was fantastic - overlooking Bellagio fountains. Room decor was ok, bed comfortable, bathroom very spacious. The price was very good too. 

The buffet place downstairs served really delicious food, but was way overpriced. I guess that's typical for a city where there aren't restaurants on every corner. Supply and demand... 

The on-site casino was pretty good. Our dealer was super pleasant and friendly; i wish i had remembered his name I'd put it out here for everyone to see... 

The front desk were not very friendly... They wouldn't help us with our boarding passes. Perhaps, being used to California hospitality i expect too much... 

The club, whatever the name was... oh, I remember, Prive, was very disappointing. We were on the guest list, yet had to wait in line for one whole hour, and then ended up paying the bouncer a pretty big sum to only get in and get totally disappointed. 

The lobby is a maze and it's not hard to get lost there... 

The housekeeping manager was very nice. I came back home and realized i had left a piece of clothing there. Called them, the housekeeping manager was a sweet lady who promptly returned my phone call after I had left a voicemail, and shipped my item back to me at a pretty reasonable price... 

Will probably go back if the price is still good.It is close to everything on the strip. I am not so crazy about their planet dailies but PH has really good services. Their valet parking guys are funny and friendly, front desk staff is friendly and helpful. Their clubs are okay.. but my favorite is their spa. It is really good. my gal pal and i picked one afternoon and enjoyed the spa. it's kinda pricy but totally worth the money.the rooms here are alright. there is absolutely no lighting in the room and the bathroom doesn't have a proper door. we were really comfortable otherwise though. the casino is nice and we spent plenty of time gambling there. major bummer on the pool, definitely not a good time.Likes
-Great value, awesome location on the strip for a good price
-ABC store inside the hotel selling non-overpriced beer/liquor was awesome for pregaming

Dislikes
-Beds weren't as heavenly as I wanted...all of our backs hurt!
-The bathroom was my biggest gripe: a pathetic small/weak shower head and a glass shower door that wasn't very convenient for multiple people utilizing the bathroom simultaneously...unless you're all really good friends.I can't stand staying here...Doesn't matter if I got the card and winning money and get free night stays I just can't get over the fact that the parking is eons away from the elevators. I don't mind the rooms. The rooms are in fact classy and sophisticated. Trendy I would say, but the walk from the parking...drive me nuts. I just want to get from my car without going around miracle mile (wow maybe that's why they call it that? - yeah I know miracle mile in LA it's just about a mile to walk to the elevators lol) I  can do the free valet thing but the wait just to get your car is the same as if you walked to your car or even more...I wish they just had a hallway that cut down the middle since apparently the entrance of the parking is directly parallel to the entrance of the casino and doesn't matter which way you go, its still freaking far. I swear when I stayed there 3 times, the 3rd time I found that going to the right was faster since to the left you pass the water thing but I think I was just delusional or think that I was going in the nearest direction possible.its okay...kindy spendy for a little amount of food

spent 22 dollar each person 

i got the blue grab and my friend got the 1 lb shrimp plus a dozen oyster...

its good...but its kind of time consuming

oysters are not good....

if you like shrimp and crawfish than its good...

if not... its only going to be okay....I prefer the boiling crab restaurant over hot and juicyWhen I saw this place we were expecting NOLA cajun crawfish. It was far from it.  The food  good for the most part, the spices and sauce were overwhelming. It was not spicy since i got mild. It was just so much in the bag. New Orleans crawfish boil is simpler but with big flavor. But i can see why people might like it here. Just not my cup of tea. However, the service was excellent. I am curious of how much plastic, styrofoam  and paper they throw out!I was craving some vietnamese sandwiches and found this place on yelp. Saw 4 stars and thought it must be a really good place to try. I tried their house combination and grilled chicken. They use baguette bread instead of the other kind of bread I was used to. To be honest, my review is solely based on my experiences from my home town. The baguette bread was too crispy and they were pretty skimpy on their filling. The flavor wasn't too great on the house special. I love the house special (#12 and huong lan in sac). I was hoping to get that same taste. But the meat and pate just didnt taste right. The grilled chicken was pretty tasty though. I just wish there was more of the pickled carrots and softer bread.3.5

Decent middle eastern food, had the chicken kabob plate, not a ton of flavor but not bad, would give it another chance.Price:  200% of what you'd expect to pay.  We had 5 people and the bill was about $75.  Pretty stunning.

Service:  Excellent, and the entire process makes you feel like the feeding cattle that you are.  The rope lines for ordering, and the self-service condiment bar are reminders that you can help yourself, although we will charge you more than retail price.  I'm not sure why Guy Fieri thought this was a good place to go, since families could never afford to eat at prices like this.

Taste:  is very good, and the portions will keep you longing for more.

I don't know why restaurants keep trying to mimic a Scottsdale-like theme and a Scottsdale-like price.  Please listen-- we don't need fancy places with sky-high prices that keep working-man families away.  We need low-priced, good food with college-kid-type prices.  Please let the Scottsdale-type prices die.The idea for Third Thursdays is a great one, but I don't think it is catching on like First Fridays in downtown Las Vegas. Third Thursdays occurs every third Thursday of the month on Water Street, a few blocks north of the convention center. It was around 5:45pm when I went, and the street seemed to be dead. I couldn't find the art gelleries at first, but after a bit of walking around jail bond businesses and antiques stores, one appeared. Why aren't they advertising!? So frustrating. Anyway, once I went inside there was a nice table complete with store bought brownies and bean dip. Surrounding this table was a small art exhibit. I am assuming the only four people there were the artists themselves. A man played (tinkered with) a guitar and another man was making some piece of jewelry. There was a box to place a vote for you favorite piece of art you saw, so I participated. I think I was the first vote in the box. The funny thing is that if Third Thursdays was advertised or marketed AT ALL, I believe a nice size crowd would show. City of Henderson, please listen: we need more events like this, with bigger crowds and more excitement. This is a great launching point, but give it a bit more "oomph" and let peeople know about it!So after i walked out of coldwater canyon wearing my overalls and carrying my 1/4 inch drive and covered in Grease what better place to grab some lunch than in Al's garage..... "Right" I understand the atmosphere and what you are going for, but you have a compettitor/partner restaurant next door that serves the same things as you, out of the same kitchen. The only reason i know this is because my wife asked the server what the difference between the two burgers was, due to the waitress giving us a menu with some other restaurant name on it. She said oh theirs is toasted and has a sauce on it. It made no sense until i walked out and saw that this other restaurant was right next door and had the same menu. The wait staff is definitely easy on the eyes and they attempt to flirt a few more bucks out of you at the end of you meal... I can't complain, you do what you have to do..Right?! Anyways, the food is alright not the greatest, the atmosphere is okay if it were better placed it would make more sense but it works I guess. This place gets pretty packed at night as well.I liked the atmosphere of this restaurant but that is about all I liked.  The food was average as was the service.  Have not been back.What a coincidence that this place is called Basil 'n Lime because I walk in and the my first thought was 'Oh! it smells like lime...!'

The restaurant itself is pretty large with modern-ish decor in comparison to other Thai restaurants. They have strings of Christmas lights up in an artsy fashion. It ain't Christmas, but tis the season - it works with the overall feel of the restaurant. The boyfriend and I walked into an empty restaurant with the exception of a party of 6 finishing up their meal on a Saturday night. We were greeted by one of the waitresses and seated at a table. 

We ordered Thai tea, beef pad see ew, and chicken ginger and mushroom. The thai tea kind of rubbed me the wrong way. It tasted super powdery but this is most likely because I didn't mix well enough. We waited for a while before our dishes were brought out to us. We're very patient people but for us to wonder when our food will be at our table is a tell tale sign that they're taking way too long. Annoying, since we were essentially the only ones in the restaurant. But we gave them the benefit of the doubt and figured they were making our food ultra fresh.

What we didn't realize when ordering was that their portions (at least for dinner) are huge! The two dishes were pretty good. Not the best we've ever had, but we had no major complaints. The chicken ginger and mushroom is quite misleading by name. The dish didn't have that extra bite of ginger I was searching for. Where were the mushrooms? They were hiding and didn't want to come out. There were a lot of other veggies though - carrots, onions, bell peppers. Good portion of chicken, which I appreciated. The beef pad see ew had a good amount of beef as well. They definitely don't shy away from your protein portions! Basil 'n Lime serves their pad see ew with regular broccoli. Perhaps this is consumer's preference but I definitely like my pad see ew with Chinese broccoli, not regular American broccoli. I feel as though Chinese broccoli gives the ample amount of crunch that a chewy dish such as pad see ew really needs. Both dishes were at a heat level of 5/10. I'll tell you what - heat level 5 barely scratched the capsaicin receptors on my tongue! If you like medium-spicy as I do, you should probably bump it up a notch to a 6, maybe a 7 if feeling a little brave. 

I'm not sure if I'll be back for dinner anytime soon. But I hear they have great lunch specials. I'm more than open to take a stab at one of those if given the time and opportunity.I had to go to Sprinkles on my trip out to Scottsdale to see what the hype was about.  

Appearance was nice.  The store is small.  I felt cramped and it didn't take long for the line to reach the door.  Service was okay.  The service was unorganized with girls running around with notepads and taking orders, but other than that I got my cupcakes. 

Got the Red Velvet and Peanut Butter Chocolate.  Peanut Butter Chocolate was okay.  The icing was not over powered with sweetness but the cake was dry.  Red Velvet was good as well, cake wasn't as dry as the Peanut Butter Chocolate and icing was rich and good. 

I'm not sure what the hype is about since there are many other cupcake boutiques out there that are better and cheaper.  

Probably wouldn't visit a Sprinkles in any other location.I've been eating Sprinkles for a few years now and while I'm always excited to go in, pick out a couple flavors (including a doggie cupcake for my dog), I end up being a little disappointed in the product I receive.

The cupcakes are a little pricey, decently sized, and often a little dry with overly sweet frosting. I don't really like the set up of standing in line to pick out a cupcake and then forming a new line to pay, but it is what it is. There are definitely other local bakeries with similarly priced, superior products. If you've never had Sprinkles, I would give it a try for the experience, but I wouldn't make a special trip.Cupcakes are good,  nice variety and selection, very unorganized leading to ineffiency which inevitably leads to longer than necessary wait timesThis place was good.  It was a nice location from the Hyatt when we went to Phoenix Comicon this year.  We probably ate here at least twice.  The staff was great, but at times I could tell they wished the comicon crowd wasnt in town...Lenny's Burger Shop provided a decent lunch for me although the food was not quite as good as I expected.

The restaurant is neat, but feels rather cramped on the inside since it is very small and there are not a lot of tables. It is kind of cool in a way though.

The burger is far from the best you have had as are the fries, but kudos to Lenny's for keeping prices reasonable. Compared to places I have been to like this I thought the prices here were great, so if I come back it will be for that reason.The burgers here were good but not stellar. I had a chicken burger with brie, smoked bacon, and shallots, while my friend had the "le classique" beef burger with brie and some other toppings that have slipped my mind. All burgers come served with lettuce, tomato, red onion, a pickle, and your choice of house-baked bun. We also ordered a french fry sampler of skinny and waffle fries. The fries were outstanding--perfectly crispy and seasoned, with no greasy residue. The mistake we made was that we ordered a sampler, when one order of fries is more than enough to feed two people with average appetites. Our server was Nicoletta and she was very friendly and provided excellent service. The price was reasonable, and they have great Happy Hour specials. Would we go here again? There's a slim possibility, but there are so many great burger joints in Las Vegas, this would be on the bottom of our list. In the future, come here for the Happy Hour specials and the french fries. They also have lots of flatscreens, so this would be a good option for those who want to watch the game over a beer.We've been here quite a few times for movies.  I'm a fan of buying at the ticket kiosks so it helps that they all work.  This place has the big screens which is nice for movies that have a lot of special effects.Just not impressed when you compare it to other Marriott's or hotels that stay on top of their accommodations.  

  It is a ways from the strip. I knew that going in so I won't fault them for location, but I did underestimate how far off it was.  The quick 10 minute drive is more like 20-30 minutes from parking lot to parking lot. 
   The staff is very friendly and I do appreciate the service, I'm just accustomed to everything being more prepared.  The last thing I care for after a long flight is staff knocking on the door to drop off things that hadn't been prepared before checking in like the extra pillows.  
  I also appreciate the little things the most like free internet (which the JW does not have) and a LCD or plasma TV I can connect to my HDMI laptop. These are important to me.  I can get free WiFi at McDonalds with my $2 egg mcmuffin, but have to pay $10 for WiFi at a Marriott??? I also like to watch a movie from my laptop after a long day and not being able to hook up my laptop to the TV is annoying.
  Another thing that would be nice would be an alarm clock.  There isn't one in the room.  Really???
  Overall the room is fairly comfortable but having trouble getting it warm (coming from Florida, it's a little chilly in the room even with the heat turned up).  The heater or pipes or something in the wall sure makes a lot of knocking and rumbling sounds throughout the night as well.  Another personal quirk of mine as I'm a really light sleeper.
  The room is nice though even if a bit worn.  Outside the room, the hotel looks nice as well with the water streaming through the grounds (it's just too cold to enjoy it all).
  Restaurant choices leave a little to be desired.  The Irish Pub is the only thing that looks appealing unless you're into the cheaper buffet type food found in a typical low cost cafeteria.  I didn't try Ceres because I'm more of a Steak or Burger kind of guy than a Tofu and Watercress kind.
  Over all, not a bad experience though, just not what I'd hoped for.Horrible breakfast food, Excellent service though, Alex behind the bar early afternoons is the best . Very dark inside, loads of seating,I love the happy hour here! The cheap steaks and eggs! $2 margaritas! 

For the price you are paying... there's no complaint... service will be service in Sin City!Almost three years since my previous review, I stayed here again and maintain a 3 star rating.

As my other Yelpers have noted:

1) The price is definitely reasonable based on location and accomodations. Having access to the pool at the Flamingo is great.

2) There is no flexibility on checkout time. It's 11am. If you leave at 11:01 you will be charged! After noon, it's a half day charge. They claim this is because there is no resort fee. Very inflexible policy on this.... 

3) Checkin- same deal, extra charge for an early checkin... To get a slightly better room, they offered it to me for $20 but then was told it was 'cash only' no receipt. Thinking about this afterwards, left a poor taste in my mouth, but we wanted to get a room and not have to wait. 

4) Otherwise, the rooms are clean, the location great and reasonably priced. 

It's not the Mirage, or Monte Carlo (certainly not the Bellagio or Venetian) but it's a nice place to go, when it'e expensive elsewhere and you are looking to save a little on accomodations.Another classic bites the dust -- Bill's Gamblin' Hall closed for good yesterday. I know it wouldn't be Vegas if it wasn't always changing, but geez if the past couple years haven't been rough for the old standbys.

The Sahara, the first hotel I ever stayed at on the strip, with its tiny Casbah Lounge, metalhead lifeguards, $1 blackjack and let-your-freak-flag-fly vibe: Gone.

Imperial Palace (though I would never actually sleep there) with the most ghetto-fabulous casino on the strip, all chintzy Chinee themed with dealers dressed as dead celebrities: Gone. 

And now, Bill's Gamblin' Hall and Saloon, a monument to '70s tastelessness, with it's faux Old West chandeliers, $6 steaks and enough smoke to drive away George Burns: Gone. I understand that stuff needs updates and we can't freeze the past in amber, but c'mon -- do we really need another boutique hotel with $200 rooms and a nightclub called Za or Xe or Qi? What's next? Tearing down the Flamingo and replacing it with an Embassy Suites? Turn the Luxor into a W?

I'm gonna make a great grandpa someday. See ya on the flippy, Bill's.The salads are better than the pizza which is odd. For a place called a pizza kitchen you can do a lot better for pizza all of the valley. Now the salads are a different story. The portions are huge and the ingredients are well selected. I go for the Waldorf Salad. They seem to be pushing alcohol more lately which is fine but after two suggestive sales of booze at 11am on a Monday, it turned me off a bit.This place is nice. It's a high end PT's Pub. So the menu is a great Bar Food Extravaganza. This location seemed pretty dead. I don't think I have ever seen it really packed. I was hesitant but figured why not. Walking in is really nice. Kinda modern with a little bit of sportiness. There was only one bar tender and one waitress. Would of assumed the waitress would of been hot like the ads and pictures display but ehhhh. The menu was pretty decent. Flaming Hot Cheeto Onion Rings sounded good as well as their wings and fingers and variety of sauces. This place can be serious competition to BWW if it was marketed right. We tried the Breakfast English Muffin Sandwich with hash browns. The egg was fluffy and bacon crisp and the Muffin was toasted perfectly on both sides. Also tried the Philly Cheese Steak with Chips. They used Whiz which was good but the meat was a bit dry. The bun claimed to be authentic but it wasn't  The Steak didn't have that flavorful taste like from Pop's or Geri's. It was a decent Cheese Steak. The Chips were the clear winner. Made fresh and almost Kettle Style Crispy. Had Cookoo Seasoning which was awesome. It was addicting like crack. The server said they even add that to the fries. Mmmmm, so my first time in a high end PT's wasn't what I expected but Im sure I'll give it another chance to see if I can get wow'd. Until next time, LET'S EAT!!!Boooo.  They don't carry Boones Farm!  I'm sorry but I like something cheap with a fruity taste.Looking for a good sushi happy hour? This place has some great drink specials, but the sushi is a bit pricey for what it is. It's decently enjoyable - they have some good concoctions, but there are better rolls and sashimi out in Phoenix (try Sapporo or Sakana - the latter is my pick of the litter).Elevator ride. Get off elevator. Walk in a big ass circle. Enough said, I just saved you $20. You're welcome :)KInd of a mixed bag here on my first visit. This is the ultimate neighborhood bar experience because nearly every dude that entered during my two-hour stay was greeted by name. I had read about happy Hour specials online prior, but when I asked about them to the heavily tattooed bargirl, she didn't mention them, instead telling me about the higher priced all-day special. How can you get new regulars if you treat the newcomers like we are from Planet Mar?  Maybe they got enough regulars, but they might need to get younger cause some of regulars are getting old. She did become nicer after I chatted up one of her old buddies at the bar and she even put the Yankees game on the small bar TV for me. The food I ordered to go contained the worst version of sweet potato fries ever - burnt and undercooked at the same time (see photo). The Western Chicken was pretty good though featuring two giant onion rings and a rather large thin cut chicken breast covered with cheese and bonus bacon which wasn't on the original description. The bun took a beating with too much BBQ sauce, but overall not bad. It is supposed to get crowded at night, might check it out then and happy Hour prices are good on domestics also.It was fine and very convenient. I should have booked online and could have gotten a better rate.OMG - no I'm not a pre-teen, I only like to talk like one when I'm so excited about a place.

This place is amazing.  I never would have considered coming here if my friend had not needed something and promised me lunch if I went with her.  I don't fish or hunt or do most outdoorsy things, but this place is so cool.

There is a river and fish and a climbing wall and a fudge shop!  Yes, a fudge shop; with very good fudge BTW.

They have everything one would need for the outdoor life and look forward to going back and spending more time going thru most departments (can't see going thru hunting, but you never know).

One and only caveat so far, slow check out.  I went there the day after black Friday and was in a long line with only 1 checker.  1.  ONE.  - They finally brought one other person but didn't seem to make much of a dent.  I hope it's not always like this.The food at Brasserie V is generally good, but service is hit-or-miss, which means your meal may be lukewarm by the time it reaches your table. Being with a group of four or more exacerbates the problem. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the BBQ Pulled Pork ($9) and the Grilled Chicken & Blue ($8.50) sandwiches I had for lunch on two separate occasions. If you're there for Sunday Brunch, try the 4-Layer Crepe with Nutella ($9) or the Smoked Salmon Benedict ($10) with a cup of perfectly brewed Alterra coffee.  Note that portions tend to be on the light side.Chompie's has really good food and a huge menu!  They are really close to ASU and seem to busy all of the time.  They have breakfast, lunch and dinner options. 

They start you with a bowl of homemade pickles.  Not a fan, but my friends really like them.  I really like their pastrami and corn beef sandwiches and sliders.  I usually go for the sliders and a salad so I can split it with someone.  The prices are too high, especially for someone in college, so splitting a meal here is do-able based on the portion sizes and price.Chicken schnitzel was amazing. Service was slow and server didn't know the menu. Didn't know what a knish was.We allowed 2 hours before our show to eat here and the service was so slow that we had to curtail our meal and run.
The restaurant serves wonderful food at a hefty price so it was a shame that we had a 45 min wait between soup and main courses.
It would have been nice if the management had come over and apologize instead of leaving our waiter to handle the situation.
When our food came it was clear some of it was hot and fresh and some had been hanging around.
I think they paid attention to large tables and our table of 4 just didn't get the attention.
Sad sad sad!my bf and I went to Blush because we got on the guest list. We both had never heard of it, but with free entry in vegas we decided to check it out. This is def not a night club, it has a way more relaxed lounge-y feel. The decor is pretty cool and the bartenders and bouncers are nice. The drinks are super pricey, but its vegas so thats to be expected. The free champagne was gross, but again its free so I cant really complain too much. Lots of middle aged gentlemen roam this club so if you are a young female you WILL get hit on. The bottle service girls are gorgeous so if you are a group of guys def opt for the bottle service and have a stunning lady wait on you all night long.My UFC hangout. I think my name may be embroiderd on a seat. Go Silva!!!Been here at least 50 times

Likes: It's not a chain, Great coffee, Good Food, Nice decor
Dislikes: Very spotty service, High pricesDecent carnivore fare. Waaaaaay too loud. 

  I'm not one to hang in a loud meat eaters haven. I'm also not into hanging around places that adorn their bars with women's discarded bras. Somehow Dicks Last Resort reeled me in. Their food is decent. Better than fast food but too $$ for the quality they provide. I had hot wing chicken tenders which were hot, made of chicken, and cooked well. Enough said...
  The waitstaff is rude but that's their gimmick. Sometimes they'll put an innuendo laden sign upon your head. I think that's just silly. They'll try to embarrass you. That pisses some people off to the point of leaving. Eh... It is what is... An experience. But it comes with the hefty Vegas price tag.This place is definitely in the right spot. Vegas baby.. I don't think it would work too many other places. When you go in, your insulted, yelled at and have things thrown at you. There's a guy that walks around that makes balloon hats. You truly don't want to know what my friend's balloon hat was .... Then your waiter/ess may feel the need to manufacture  a huge/tall paper hat made for you out of butcher paper. They put it on you with out you asking or realizing. It's not till all the laughs and stares that you get the idea that something lewd maybe written about you. Yes, I did get one. The waitress wrote something about meeting me at the 'happy ending' salon.. Nice eh.. any ways,.. if you have a sense of humor, don't mind vulgarity then it can be a entertaining place to dine. Also, there is the bar man who does a water show to music. The food and drinks where your typical $$$$. My friend paid $4 for a glass of Sprite.
The place doesn't really float my boat for my personality but with a group of friends it was o.k..  One more thing, there's a stage for a live band. The time we where there, it was vacant.I liked this place if you're trying to avoid going to a buffet or a club. We started our night here and it was fun. The food has huge portions, so it maybe expensive but just know you're getting a lot of food! the chips and salsa come with three different salsas and it's about 4 dollars for it, but it's very good! I shared the shrimp taco plate with a friend. They come with three small tacos, with rice and beans on the side. The tacos were excellent, a lot of lightly breaded shrimp. The beans are a little spicy but still very good as well as the rice. I liked this place because they have happy hour every day from 3-7pm. They spin a wheel every 30 minutes so different drinks end up being 3 dollars! it's a great place to start out the night, and i definitely recommend it!the sandwiches are awesome here! i would totally give earls a 4-5 star rating based on my previous experiences BUT last weekend's experience left me very unsatisfied. The food was good if they had spoons! I ordered a sandwich+soup and found out the spoons/forks were out. I went and asked the server for a spoon and he just looked at me with a blank stare. I explained to him that they were out and I needed it for soup. He completely ignored my request. 

I understand that earls isnt a high end restaurant. But cmon! Any other establishment would offer me the basic utensils.The food is good but the service is less than desirable.  Every time I go I feel like the servers just cant wait until you leave.  The servers sit up at the bar and speak to each other in Thai and watch TV which is fine unless you need a refill.  They close after lunch in the middle of the day so call and see what time they open for dinner.Should be 2.5 stars...

Atmosphere is loud, cramped and dark (we ate inside).  Patio area was louder but at least you could people watch and had a nice view of the fountain they had.

Service: Prompt, attentive, and the waiter was very nice.  We had 9 people all showing up at different times and he was very accommodating.  We also had a B-Day and he added a B-day dish with a candle. 
Food: Just OK.  No one disliked their dished but no-one totally loved them either.  I ordered the Linguine Al Frutti Di Mare (their "signature dish").  Basically it's lobster, crab, scallops, scallions and tomatoes in a white cream sauce.  It was ok at best.  Shrimp and Scallops wee flavorful, Lobster was not.  Sauce was bland.  
Price:  Like most of the Strip it is over-priced.  Dishes are from $18 to $30.

Best way to describe this place...food is a tick less tasty than Olive Garden but cost $10 more per dish.My wife and I have gone to this place twice. The first time the service was mediocre, but the food was excellent. Today, we went back because we wanted to try their sushi. Overall it was a good visit, the service was OK, the sushi was good, but they didn't do a very good wrapping for the sashimi. I don't think we'll go back I'm just not sure it was worth the bucks.Nice to sit and people watch for sure... not as much fun if you want to go to Target and either dinner or a movie without moving the car.

I do like all the seating areas and water/fire features they have.I wasn't sure if I should review this, because I thought it was so-so.  Everyone raves about it.  Everyone else in our Group loved it.  I thought it was weird.  The music was good.  The actors were impressive.  I was falling asleep.  Getting into the theater was a production and the drinks / snack line was super long.   Just not a "show" guy.I am such a huge fan of comedy, I watch it as much as possible! The group was going to a circ show but we ended up seeing George Wallace. Overall, not too bad...not overly funny. I laughed but not as hard as I hoped. I felt the show dragged on a bit too much and hoped for another entertainer to break up the show a bit. Getting a cocktail was a little bit of a wait, which it should never be in a comedy show, one should never have to take their attention away from the performance to wonder about a cocktail. Not a bad show to see but I would not say it would be my first choice. George Wallace is pretty funny I laughed a good amount and you can tell he works very hard to do a good job, I think if the time was cut down a little it would do wonders for the show, or maybe I should just try to work on my attention span!?Second Time I Been In the Last 2 Weeks Good Food, Will Like To Try A Few More Things On The Menu.. Will Go BackFun idea.  Crazy interesting combinations thrown on bread.   We went after seeing on Man VS Food but I was less than blown away.   I think you should go, just don't plan on having the best quality food of your life.   The overall experience was fun.Came here for the first time with my friend Brandon and kinda liked it. The bar is in the center of the casino which makes it great for people watching. 

We sat down and I didn't know what I wanted so Brandon decided to order me something called AMF (adios mother effer) and I kinda liked them. The bartender kept them coming whenever he saw my glass getting low and I appreciate that but I think anymore than 3 AMF's is too much.

I liked this bar and might return but it wont be my first choice.I ate at Koi in Las Vegas because I had been to the Koi in NYC a couple of years ago and was blown away by the food.  

The food in Las Vegas was good, but to be frank, I wasn't blown away by the sushi.  I've had better sushi at much less cost in other places. 

My dinner consisted of the Kobe Beef Carpaccio, Seaweed Salad, and then a lot of Sushi and rolls.  

All of the food was good, but nothing to really rave about.  The salmon sushi was delicious - which i would expect from this place.  However, the Tuna sushi was just OK.  

I will say that the service was fantastic.  When one of my mates accidentally knocked over his drink, they came right away to help clean and replaced the full set of spicey tuna rolls that we had ordered with a brand new fresh set....even though there was only one piece left.  Major kudos for that.A very fancy restaurant by day and an Asian inspired club by night, I opted for the dinner at night with co-workers. 

Connie C. states it well when she calls it "Zen-Chic" cause it feels Vegas when you walk in, which is very non LA/NY vibe. 

We sat in the back area which overlooked the strip, a decent view (it's no BOA steak house view like at Caesar's or Fountain Room of Mandalay Bay) but it was nice, you can see the Bellagio fountain and the Paris Hot Air Balloon. 

The food was a bit pricey for what it was, albeit good, I know that making it in LA could shave off $2 - $3. However there was an appetizer that was not on the menu that we ordered (a kobe beef topping on a fried wonton with chives and spicy mayo) and it was a tasty treat being the chef made without us knowing exactly what was in it and from a picture. 

I'd come here again with a group because it was fun, but I think I'd look off strip for a cheaper experience. But if you don't mind paying more based on atmosphere and location while still getting great sushi, then stop by Koi for your fresh fish fix. 

Enjoy.I've done Mongolian several times.  I like it.  I'd heard about this place, and the reviews here seem to be good, so let's give it a try!

We were greeted very enthusiastically by a young man I assume (based on observations through the evening) was the manager.

They have two sizes of bowls.  The large is only $1 more.  And they have an option for unlimited refills for another dollar above that.  All prices include drinks and frozen yogurt (and rice and soup).

The actual ingredient table was nothing special.  Limited spices, smaller selection of veggies.  A few sauces, though they include recipes for mixing several more.  One of their people was very helpful at the sauce table, mixing what we wanted.  Though they didn't have (or I didn't see) some standard sauces like szechuan.  And the names of the spices really didn't tell me much about them (except "cumin", of course...and "lemon pepper").  So it was sort of a guessing game what I was getting.

They encourage you to pack your bowl, and even have tissues to aid in doing so (and keep your hands clean).    The staff is friendly. The sauce was not very strong, even though I chose "spicy Hunan".  The flavor was really pretty mild.  And the noodles were either rice or wheat.  Really?  What about soba?

To compare and contrast, Genghis Grill has a larger selection of spices, sauces (though no recipes to mix variations), and seemed more flavorful.  But the quantity at YC's is definitely a LOT more.  Even packing the same amount, their large bowl is much larger.  I will probably try them again to see if a different selection of spices and sauces will improve the flavor.  Next time I'll do rice noodles, too.  I may update my rating when I try again.Maybe the BEST service I've ever received. We're you expecting me to say pizza? Well the pizza is not my cup of tea but the rest of my party devoured it. Seriously, D-voured it. My reason for not loving the pizza is probably the same reason that makes this pizza so fabulous for almost everyone else...cheese. Amore's pizzas are absolutely loaded, dripping, oozing with hot, gooey cheese.  Which apparently is only an issue for me. I prefer my pie with tons of crushed tomatoes, lots of yummy veggies and very lightly sprinkled with just a smidgen of mozzarella. I know that I'm in the minority here so when my group of six suggested a trip to this eatery I happily went along for the company and the beer, which, much to my dismay, they don't serve. Frown.

The view from here is amazing. The entire front wall of this restaurant is one giant window with an unobstructed view of the fabulous Las Vegas Strip. The decor is pretty cool as well. The walls are over-crowded with photographs from cityscapes to movie stars and athletes. They have a really nice panorama of the Chicago skyline right when you walk in the front door. It's an overall inviting atmosphere thanks to the decor and the staff. We were greeted and seated immediately upon walking in and were very well taken care of throughout the meal. We sat around talking for a good bit after the meal and bill were taken care of and the waitress still kept checking on us periodically. She even brought out a large platter with a generous potion of zeppoles (fried dough strips) for dessert on the house. They were fresh from the fryer and topped with powdered sugar and a drizzle of honey. Very nice finishing touch.Came here for the second time despite having a difficult experience the first time. Expect mediocre service and waitresses who care more about eating their ice cream than taking your order..... Let alone the right order. The first time around we had to ask for refills on drinks and waited around to get our check processed while they were busy talking amongst themselves. We were the only people in the restaurant and we had to ask to be served. Doesn't make much sense to me. 

This time around I gave them a second shot. Their spaghetti and meatball lunch special was yummy like the first time around but the thin crust pizza was good but not that good. We ordered pepperoni, mushrooms, and sausage and ended up with pepperoni, mushrooms, and a massive amount of onions. The onions made the rest of the pizza taste like Dominos ( the boyfriend said this ). He really wanted to try their home made sausage on the pizza so we are still waiting. Other than that, the service was still lacking even though we were one of two tables in the restaurant. I would be disappointed but fool me once shame on you......fool me twice shame on me. 

As far as recommending this place.... I would say make sure you come when a good waiter/waitress is here. I wouldn't know if they have one. But the food is worth it just as long as you want waitresses who is concerned more with their ice cream as your food dies in the window. /harsh. I know.Very convenient when staying at the Signature, especially when you do not want to take the journey to any of the eateries the hotel has to offer. Fairly priced for Vegas standards and the overall quality was there. Stopped for a brunch and felt satisfied with the veggie omelet, white chocolate French toast and tuna melt sandwich.Decent burger but underwhelming chili. The chili should be the star of their signature burger, and it was more like an afterthought. The burger was OK, but  I wouldn't rush back. 

There is no easy access to the restaurant from St. Rose, which is a deterrent.  I had to drive through the hospital parking lot to get here. Doh!
The yellow peppers were very good, they added a lot of flavor to the burger.Boo hoo! Gas prices are lower at the independent gas station across the street. Even with the special ten cent per gallon Smith's reward card price, the gas station across the street that does smogs and car washes was STILL cheaper. WTF? And food, beer, and wine prices are just way too expensive by comparison. Smith's is Kroger Foods, as is Food4Less. Get it? It's Food4Less quality with marketing. What's the difference between the quality of food at Food4Less and Smith's? Nothing. You get prepackaged sushi and a seafood counter and fried chicken at Smith's ... that's it. If prices do not accurately reflect the Las Vegas economy at this Smith's store, my rating will decrease.I didn't get to dance there, but my friends raved about it... given it's cover free and there's high tech lighting all around... I think I'd visit it again next time I am in town for a fun night out..I grabbed a few drinks here with a group of friends the night before UFC 106. It was easy for us to find a table even with the lounge being a little crowded. 

Good: Music was ok (top 40 remix, a bit of house, some 80s remix), drinks were stiff and reasonably priced, chill yet chic atmosphere, close to blackjack tables, decent size dance floor.

Bad: cocktail waitress took forever and I don't think I ever saw her smile.Came here because it was within a 5 mile radius from our hotel..hahaha! Long story.  ANYWAY, we went twice.  The first time on a busy Saturday night--service was great..food was amazing..and the lemonade was tasty tasty.  Went back on a Thursday night and meh at best...service was blah..food was meh..and just not what it had been on the weekend when the place was PACKED! So..that's that...pry won't be back since sooo many other choices.  But, if we do go back, it will DEF be on a weekend.Mac and Cheese burger was big and greasy. Very tasty and unhealthy. Drafts are fairly priced and cold. No complaints about the food or drink from me. Service was spotty despite  not being too busy. Having visited several breweries before I was disappointed by SanTan's "store". All hats were pretty much the same (black with the logo on front) and cheap looking shirts.The buffet here is OKAY.  It's decent food and not too expensive.  Everything is fresh, though, so I can't complain about that!

Try the Mirage buffet for about the same price, but way better food!Pretty decent food - more towards the american menu. 

They do have a simple japanese sushi spread, not that fantastic. Oriental spread - pretty ok. American spread and italian spread(with pizzas and pastas) make up the bulk of their menu. 

Salad spread is good though, with different types of salads to choose and the buffet lady would start mixing the different greens together.

Drinks are free (any type), except the alcoholic ones.

Overall, I would give this a 6/10, definitely tasted way way better buffets than these, but it deserves the thumbs up for the price I paid for it and for the spread it serves.

Tip: One way to get really good and economical value buffets is to head to tix4dinner.com and get a buffet discount coupon. You pay 2 dollars and you get 25% or something like off your dinner buffet. Might be even more.

Once again, it isnt that fantastic but if you're on a budget, this should be more than sufficient!

Cheers!We got two free passes to eat buffet. The lady at the desk was nice to let us use it for breakfast since we couldn't fit in a lunch or dinner. First off its a breakfast with a pretty good selection of choices of food. I was impressed with the mini donuts, the omelet station and the Chinese breakfast. 
The thing that killed it for me was the egg Benedict. I love egg Benedict but e hollidaise sauce. It was sour. Big disappointment. My boyfriend got scrambled eggs and was not impressed either. Boo. What was good for me was the BBQ pork buns and the congee. A simple Asian breakfast. 
For a free meal it wasn't bad but if you're paying there are so many other buffets in town to try,Nothing to complain about with regard to the food -- it was flippin fantastic! The waiter was exceptional until after our entree course was delivered. After then, he could care less that we were there and moved on to other tables. He left us with the overworked backwaiter who, to his credit, tried, but was overwhelmed. We would have ordered desert, but after waiting a half hour for someone to come back decided to leave.You are at the mercy of who is the comedian at the time you go.  Sometimes you can be lucky and get a really good comedian.  Other times, the comedian can be not so good.  So, it can range from 1 to 5 stars depending on who you see.

The atmosphere is fine and comfortable.  The Improv is a good place to hang out with friends and enjoy a show.

Overall, the Improv is a good value for Vegas.  The price is reasonable.Went for AYCE. Food was good, service (today) was terrible. 

Our waiter was quick to take our first order but then disappeared for quite some time afterward...even the other tables in the same section began to complain. The only time he was prompt to act was in collecting his tip (which would have been less had we not been a party of 6)

Still have love for Oyshi, but it's unlikely that it'll be our first choice for AYCE in the future.Some people talk about Earl's Sandwiches  the same way my boyfriend and I talk about Fulton's fish and chips! 

The menu is simple yet it reminds me a lot of KFC with their family portion options, sides, etc. The line was long, the wait was moderate,  but the smell alone made me want to stay in line. I ordered the fish and chips and some calamari. It was ready in about ten minutes. The size of the fish was just right and looked so crispy yet flaky already! The taste? Straight up mouth watering. The calamari, yeah that was bomb too. 

It's a must to come back and try some more out on the menu because there is a variety of appetizing choices.Calling themselves the "pizza alternative" DP Dough does calzones.  (They're a franchise.) Their menu lists a bunch of quirky names and has plenty of ideas for fancy things you can put in your calzone. (eggs? eh?)  I don't know if it's the freshly made crust or the large wads of cheese but for $6.50 these calzones do take care of the hungry without off messing up your beer budget.The decor is minimalistic but with boobies on display what more do you need? Hehehe the cabana was nicely tucked away and comfy. The water was refreshing in the heat of the sun. The drinks you pay hefty for but good luck ordering one. We couldn't order at the bar if we were billing it to the price of the cabana (which had a minimum food and beverage price tag) and the waitress assigned to our cabana was nonexistent. Literally 2 hours in the hot sun without a beverage is unacceptable, thankfully the mini fridge had water stocked in it. Once we were able to flag down our waitress, her return trip with our drinks came out about 20 minutes later. Is it a gimmick to make people spend more money? It baffles me. Overall it's a decent venue, just needs better service.OldSkool Bowling Alley with Uncomfortable seats

   boy does fluorescent lighting hurt at 3 am)

   5-Stars for $10 cosmic bowling (Sat & Sun)
   1-Star for the awful WEAK drinks you'll get at the bar  
   Overall Average 3.5 Stars.


The lanes here are kept pretty clean.  Comfy shoes, tons of balls in lower weights, small bar, small snack area, and a handful of vending machines. The staff was kind and courteous.  The patrons seemed to keep to themselves, and a lot of them were a little rough around the edges.  Oddly enough it was around 1 am and I still saw kids running all over the place in here.  I wish my parents let me stay up that late when I was seven.

To be honest at a place like GCBC you're going to end up with a hodge podge of people from all over the world, hey it's Vegas anything goes.

Date Rating: 7 (great place to go after dinner or a late night - no need to dragging people back to your place)
Pick up Scale: 1  (Not Recommended) 

Strong Suggestion: Be the party.  Bring the party. Close your eyes and repeat after me, "There is no place like home..."

Best Advice - come here drunk and have some water.  Plenty of Lanes to go around.  The place is gigantic.  You won't feel like you're in Las Vegas that's for sure.They were nice when signing me up and did everything I asked. The reason for the two stars is that I recently signed up at the beginning of this month at the $39.99 rate. After finding out there was a promotion for cheaper I asked switch. It is my fault because I asked for up front fee there for the higher rate but I couldn't believe that after asking to switch 2 weeks in they said no. I would have to void my payment of two months and start all over again. I am just going to go to a cheaper gym now. I can't believe they would rather lose my business 
than amend my payment.

They fixed for me. I just had to work with upper management.Good food. Girl is not too friendly  unless your Turkish.
SMALL portions LARGE PRICES! Not enough hummus or babagounish. Veggie platter price keeps going up with all the other prices. Really good food just skimpy on things and prices are very expensive for this kind of fast food.This review is mainly for their lunch special. 

I just ended my TAM card exam a few stores away earlier this afternoon and my father suggest that we grabbed lunch somewhere close by. Apparently Musashi had a lunch special going on, $9.50 for a bento box - which was quite expensive compared to $.8.50 at RA by the Fashion Show Mall considering this place offered quite a shady atmosphere. It was a little secluded and just...dark for the most part, not exactly the kind of environment that favors a happy dining experience. 

We ordered a bento with a choice of tonkatsu (pork cutlet) and shrimp/vegetable tempura. It came with miso soup, a potsticker, edamame and salad. Since we weren't too hungry, we asked for an extra bowl of rice only to find out later that additional rice orders were free...and for that I gave this review an extra star. The food was pretty good although I'd recommend Go Wild Sushi and Grill (on Tenaya and Sahara) a thousand folds over Musashi, taking everything into consideration. 

At some point, we noticed how the place needed quite a make-over. The booth couches were ripping and the music wasn't very accomodating. Summing everything up, the restaurant left quite a lasting impression that won't have me going back for awhile. If you want better Japanese Restaurants, I'd recommend shuseki in Chinatown, RA at the Fashion Show Mall and Go Wild Sushi and Grill along Sahara to name a few.Solid.
I'm not in love with the food, but it serves a purpose.  My hubby loves the cornbread, so we usually end up here versus Kona based on the bread alone!Ribs are one of my favorite things to eat.  I remeber seeing some ad the last time were stayed at RIO saying it was some famous cook or something.  To me the baby back ribs were sort of dry.  For being a rib joint I thought they would totally be better.  Service wasn't bad but wasn't good.  I liked how they had TVs all over the place so you can watch the game.  Woud I go there again, yes, but someone else would have to suggest it.  

The OCC Chpper outside was pretty cool though.Fun show for Prince fans! The downside was we found out the hard way that VIP tickets do not get you seats in the front!! There were 6 of us that pre-purchased VIP tix for the same show. We arrived 10 minutes before the show and they said it was open seating so we ended up behind everyone else. To add to the lack of VIP treatment, the t-shirts we received after the show were either x-small or xx-large. It seemed like they were just clearing out their inventory. They could have at least thrown in a group photo with the cast that they were selling for $10.This club is pretty dinky, but maybe that was just because I had been to Tao the night before. 

However, Steve Aoki was DJing, which made the atmosphere a lot better.
It was also HILARIOUS when they had the Michael Jackson impersonator come out. So awesome.
I also noticed a couple UFC fighters in the building.

It is very similar to a strip club in terms of near-naked, toned girls getting paid to shake their asses for an audience. But the main point was to create a sexy atmosphere, I believe, which they succeeded in doing. 

There was no line to get in here, unlike Tao, and it wasn't too bad of a price either. $30 for my guy and $20 for myself.

The experience was good, but not great.Buy 1 get 2nd 50% off entire store great deal. The staff is very nice and acknowledges you when you walk in. They have band t-shirts, goth attire, albums and sometimes we can find Nightmare Before Christmas items too. Though we did not find anything this time, we will be back.For the price point, the serving size, and the way things were prepared I am not going to give this a very high rating. While the food was delicious, I didn't feel that there was anything that much more special than any other steak restaurant.In my many Costco visits across the U.S. and Canada, I had to visit one in Arizona. Actually, I was in town for a Dodger Game against the D'Backs. Yeah, I am a dedicated fan! One of my rituals is to visit a Costco before a game. I found a Costco that that was near a light rail station and even takes me to Chase Field. Onwards to Costco at the Phoenix Christown Spectrum Mall.

This review is only for the food court since I did not go inside. Like many other Yelpers' surprise, this Costco is connected to a mall. I've been to Vancouver's Costco and that location is right across the Canucks and connected to a highway. I guess this location almost took the top ranks of Costco location surprises :)

Parking is very plentiful, but the most crowded spots are near the entrance. So, I parked far, but still someone parked next to me. I still don't understand that. I guess my truck brings some sort of safety or security. I took the mall side entrance and you are automatically at the food court. The Costco food court is in the mall. When I walked in, I thought right away. Costco killed the other food court competitions.

I usually get a Hot Dog and a drink, but this time I was VERY HUNGRY! So, this was my first time I got the Turkey Provolone Sandwich ($3.99) and a drink ($0.59). The sandwich was hot and delicious! I got a lot of stares from the customers....Oh wait, it wasn't because what I ordered, it was because of the Dodger Gear I was wearing :P

This review is partial since I did not go inside the Costco store. I wish I did and got some freebies. We all partake in the freebies. I should've walked in and see if they were giving free samples of ice cream, but you know my situation (Read past Costco visits). I wonder what other Costco locations that would be surprising to me. I'll have to re-watch the YouTube videos and see the international versions of Costco.

Yelp! The One Stop Place For Your Everyday Research!If you are into martinis, this place is great.  I am apparently too old, though, for the deparately seeking a hook up crowd.  Also, I am not that into pay $10 for a drink.  There are better places in Town Square to get a drink and hang out with friends.Ok so I wanted to give this place all 5 stars for its cozy feel and wonderful atmosphere but our hostess scratched in hopes of that happening.

Positives:
Great music
Great happy hour menu
Good food


Negatives:
Had to wait 20-30 minutes at a time for the hostess to come get our order.

By the time our order was taking happy hour prices were over even though we arrived a full 2 hours before the cut-off.

Out hostess seemed like she didn't want to wait on us and wasn't friendly at all.


Overall I like this place but hopefully when I go back I will get someone friendlier and someone who is faster in taking food and drink orders.Wasn't our first choice to go to Table 10, and it was actually my first Emeril restaurant.

Have to say--for all the hype of all of Emeril's restaurants in Vegas, I was surprisingly disappointed.

We were one of the last tables seated and were informed immediately that the kitchen was closing in ten minutes. We both ordered the tomato bisque as a soup. I ordered the kobe sirloin and my vegetarian friend ordered the meat pasta, just minus the meat and plus vegetables. I must say that the server was very courteous throughout the meal. Bread service was good as well. 

The soups came out within reasonable time. Our entrees took FOREVER. I didn't even notice, but a table of four who sat down after us got their entrees BEFORE we got ours. Our server kindly pointed this out after assuring that someone would be looking into our order. Considering the location of the restaurant, I was disappointed at the speed at which my food came out. Apologies were given, but the quality of the food didn't make up for the disappointment at this point.

In Table 10's defense, they did just open so maybe they're still figuring things out. For their sake, I hope they figure things out soon.The management isn't big on making sure the theater is glean. The only seats that were left is full of trash. Well that's movies today for you.This location is pretty basic as far as 99 cent stores is concerned. They have a nice selection of all the basic things you find at 99 cent stores.  On this occasion I was searching for Halloween decorations. They had pretty large selection, but there wasn't a lot of variety. It is pretty rare that I walk out of a store like this without having purchased anything, but this has happened on a few occasions at this location, so it's not my favorite 99 cent store in town.Rockhouse at IP closed a while ago due to the remodel and reopened temporarily in the PBR bar at Miracle Mile.  Now they have found a (permanent?) home at the Venetian.  There seem to be two rooms here.  A bar side and a club side.  Both have full bars and are served by the kitchen.  Smoking is allowed in the bar side.

The bar side looks like the breast place (Freudian slip?) for day drinking and the other side is the best for people watching.

I don't know if this location/arrangement will survive.  It all depends on how hard it is for them to make the rent money.  I'm sure they will promote the "club" end of things but unless they become the flavor of the month for awhile or find a way to put butts in stools they may go the way of the dodo.

Hopefully the Rockhouse has a place reserved for them in the new Linq concept since the pedestrian traffic is what fed them at the old IP location.Nothing to write home about.Ok. I don't eat Greek food so really when someone says "let's go get Gyros" I'm not that excited. But I went. I don't know if it was great or not. I have nothing really to compare it to. However; I can say, it was super busy. People just kept coming in. I guess that's a good sign, right? I ordered a chicken pita. And salad. All pretty normal stuff. What I got was messy and hard to eat and yes, the service is nothing special. The food at least looked and tasted fresh so that' always a plus. Cute place but gets busy and not a lot of seating.This spot has been previous host to Anna's Cafe (RIP), BYOBistro (RIP), Nix (RIP). But finally, I think someone put the right thing in here. A casual, daytime breakfast and lunch spot that caters to a slightly older crowd. We can literally walk here, so we hit it from time-to-time. But it doesn't have the same charm or unique menu favorites (Eggs Maximillian, Parisienne, etc) that a place like Harlow's in Tempe does. You need that to pull people from outside the hood.

DECOR
I would call it kitchsy country cafe, but they mean it. So it's not kitschy. It seriously looks like a midwestern diner, in 1974. No nonsense.


FOOD
Pretty good. Wish it were better. Good, hearty breakfast. Eggs cooked nicely, as ordered. Meats and sides prepared competently. Standard, reliable comfort food. It's straight-up midgrade foodservice stuff. Ultimately, frozen Shamrock/Sysco everything. Some things are better than others: the green chile poured over greasy fries is an excellent gutbomb. But the burgers are overcooked - maybe the meat necessitates that. Seems like a kickass burger should be a staple at a place like this.

I still have some menu exploration to do, so I'll update.

All in all, they seem to be doing well and serving their demographic what they want. I just wish Matt's was across the street instead.I've gone to a lot of the higher end steak houses in Vegas and this one is my least favorite. Service was 5 stars, the sides and the dessert we ordered were really good, however, I had to knock my rating down two stars because the star of the dinner, my wagyu filet, wasn't as good as I expected.  I was a little turned off when our sever brought out waxed examples of the different kinds of beef and explained the differences between kobe, wagyu, the marbling, etc.  To me this felt like they were trying to upsell me, I've never seen this before at a steak house, only when a place brings out their waxed trays displaying their desserts.  I would've been more okay with this if he asked us if we'd like the dog and pony show, because I already knew all the differences and already knew I was going to order the wagyu.  When my steak arrived, it was completely crusted with a blend of salt and other seasonings, now to me, a fantastic cut of wagyu shouldn't be covered in salt and seasonings, the meat should be so good that you need to add very little to it.  When a place salts as much as this place did, I question their quality of meat.  On top of my wagyu filet being super salty, they brought out three more little cups of different salts.  Holy saltiness, I couldn't even consider adding any more salt to this meat.  My wife's regular filet that she ordered was way less salty and tasted better than my wagyu, which made paying the extra for mine a very sad tale.  Most likely I won't return because there is plenty of competition in Vegas that will indeed not make me regret ordering the wagyu.I live in downtown Phoenix; Boyfriend lives in Tempe. After two years of getting our date on at places like Postino's, St. Francis, the Rokerij, Dick's Hideaway, and Padre's, we decided we needed a Tempe date place. Friday night we decided to check out La Bocca.

In short. it's okay. Nice environment, good service, pretty good pizza, and great ice cream flight for dessert. But this is tempered with over priced wine (almost $20 for two glasses of HOUSE wine?), small pieces of bruschetta (tasty - scratch that - REALLY tasty, but the slices are teeny tiny), and it's on Mill, so most of the other patrons are frat guys trying to impress sorority sisters, and if you're lucky, you'll get to see a couple of Greeks making out. Yum? There was a table of older people tucked into a corner who didn't seem to mind the age gap, but in my late-20s, I was not very much amused.

The good service, cool atmosphere, tasty bruschetta choices, and creative, thin crust pizza get this place three stars. The over priced wine and bruschetta (seriously, we usually get bruschetta at Postino's for the same price for 4 people, and then I am too full to order dinner, but at La Bocca I was ready for round two after my half of the plate), and the fact that it's on Mill keeps it from 5 stars. We both really wanted to like this place, but I think next time we want to get dressed up and go out on the East side, we'll try somewhere else. In the meantime, we'll stick to downtown.Service sucks, but the sushi are good~!I do not think the owners know what is great customer service. be prepared to wait a while!  If they know that people are waiting over an hour for food due to their understaffing, have the decency to communicate with the customers so they can either leave or understand the situation. waited about 2 hours for cold monkey balls.Best Feature: Ambiance

I'm gonna have to be brutally honest with you, Mill Avenue is not the coolest place in Tempe.  In the old days, Mill was more of a bohemian paradise, with hippie street performers, people walking in the street and a cookie shop that opened it's doors and wafted the smell of cookies through the air.

Today, the Mill Avenue District (Isn't "District" a bit lofty of a word to describe a two mile strip on one street?) has been more commercialized.  Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing - look at 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica, that's commercial and fun.  But Mill is home to several bars, 3 clothing stores and a mixture of expensive and inexpensive restaurants.  If they had truly thought out their expansion, they would have branched out a while ago and made an "arts district" a "shopping district" etc.  As it its now, they have no idea what it's supposed to be, but they slapped the "Mill Avenue District" name on it to give people the feeling they're living in a real city.

Mill's real problem now is that the buildings are too expensive for anyone not representing a giant company to afford.  Even if they somehow afford one, the rent and the lack of people buying things usually drives them in the ground (Swell Clothing RIP).

However, Mill is not without it's merits.  If you ARE looking for a place to get drunk, it's very convenient, especially for ASU students.  Slices is a great no nonsense pizza by the slice joint.  Occasionally, there are events like the Arts Festival, which end up being fun.

Overall, Mill is better than nothing, but it's got a long way to go.It's ok. Floor was dirty and our waiter seemed almost clueless. Food was good but not "write home about"I really wanted to like this place more and give it 4 or 5 stars. Great menu and lots of options. You also cannot say no to custard! The price was also reasonable. My only bad marks is that the staff seems really lost and undertrained. Lots of uncleaned tables and very dirty in general. One corner looks like they are operating an office but on the floor also. I might try again someday. But, Smashburger is right down the street and they kinda have the same concept yet it is a little more organized.Since i live down the street from this place me and the roomies decided one night to try it. The place is small but the decor was kinda cool. The rock inlayed tables were very stylish and on the cold night having free miso soup was a bonus. 

We sat near the kitchen.. ahem we smelled something that wasn't legal... 

a) sake, for cheap sake it was good
b) the fatty tuna was SOOO good
c)the fried ice cream was the best and we licked our plates. 

The only major problem i have with this place is that it's so small. I've tried coming back with friends but there was no space.Good place for reasonable food and drinks!

Since we were hungry, we started with the food order and a couple drafts.

Authentic English Fish & Chips ($10.95): One-Half Pound of Beer Battered Icelandic Cod, Fries & Peas. Huge chunk of juicy, flavorful cod! Very enjoyable...recommended!

Kart and Abdul tried the Sunday Dinner ($10.95): Roast Beef or Roast Lamb, Yorkshire Pudding, Roasted Potatoes, Vegetables & Gravy. Super filling portion size! 

Everything was good...I'd come back and sample more of the menu :)Running is a good way to sweat out yesterday's booze. That's science.

So, in training for my first half marathon, I realize it's new-shoe time. And since my last few pairs of Asics were sale-rack Sports Authority numbers, I decide to enlist some professional help. A friend's recommendation sends me to Road Runner, where they have some fancy gizmo to help me find the perfect shoes. 

One catch: It's in Tempe Marketplace. 

I brace myself for the onslaught of '90s one-hit-wonder pop songs as I open the car door. My head hurts already. At least there aren't any sullen high school kids in sight. 

Let's get this over with.

Shoe salesmen are always a bit creepy (I'm looking at you, Fashion Square Dillard's). But Road Runner's employees manage to mix the traditional sleazy shoe guy with a running nut. In other words: even creepier. And definitely with more unnecessary pep. 

They chat me up, size my feet, test my pressure points and put me on a treadmill barefoot. Forty-five minutes later, I'm out the door with the same shoes I probably would have picked on my own. 

Next time, I'll wear the new pair out. So I can run to the car.This place has enthusiasm written all over it. Or maybe it just seemed that way when my friend and I picked up our Color Run race packets last Friday.

This store has such a great selection of running shoes. It had the fancy foot fall analyzer so that you can have additional assistance when choosing the right running shoe. 

There were many slim water holders ranging from the kind you'd hold in your hand for during a shorter run to the other kind that you'd use when fueling yourself during a full marathon.

There is a membership you can pay for where you get discounted prices on everything. Otherwise, I wouldn't say that Road Runner Sports is the cheapest place to find running stuff. I'd give this analogy.... REI:CAMPIING::ROAD RUNNER SPORTS:RUNNING. You get a great selection of super nice things, but it's hit or miss with pricing. Sometimes you can score extra big with clearance items though. 

I like how Road Runner Sports tries to get people active, fit, and healthy. They hold Adventure run runs on a monthly basis. 

The staff is informative and friendly. I would certainily come here again when looking for running gear, especially now that I'm becoming more serious about running. (Sorry, could I be any more redundant with the word, "running?" See? I told you I was was serious about it!I used to be a regular and had always been pleased with the tasty food and affordable prices. I've always ordered the same thing: chips and guac, mushroom tacos with rice and beans, and house margaritas on the rocks--these items have been consistently delicious up until the last couple of  times I've visited. After a brief hiatus I returned for lunch one day and learned that they had started defaulting to flour tortillas for the tacos instead of corn, which I thought was a big down grade. Last weekend I went for dinner, and I was really disappointed to get flour tortillas again even after specifically asking for corn. The tacos are not nearly as good now. Also, the chips, which used to be free, seem to be getting more and more expensive. I know that these are tough economic times, but come on--$2 for a tiny basket of chips? This past weekend we were charged for two servings of chips even though we only got one basket. Maybe they automatically charge by the number of people in the party? Or it could have been a mistake, I didn't check. 

Anyway, I'm sure I'll still visit on occasion, but I'm disappointed in the flour tortilla policy and the chip situation. Margaritas are still good, at least. :)Everyone is very friendly. People are super super nice. Super nice. That's almost all it is. The menu has some really ridiculous hilarious names that my sister and I try to make sentences out of, "Burning Sensation" "Tastes like my ex-girlfriend". It is a true tribute to some of the more interesting parts of Japanese culture. 

Food: I think the sushi is a little over done here. Maybe I should stop ordering the combos. But if you're looking for very traditional, basic sushi, you're not going to get that here. Everything is augmented 10 fold. I agree with John about the fives, this place is not a five. It is Vegas so how fresh can the sushi really be? (Remember...desert?) But it is not a 1. I would say this place is very good to introduce people to sushi, people that are anti-raw fish and are just getting in the mode. This is good for that because a lot of the insides are cooked. Bring a large group here, they can take it.The options here are almost endless. With the bevy of toppings and countless combinations, you could come here on a regular basis and not get the same burger twice if you chose to. 

For most, the draw of customizing your own burger is a deal sealer, but for me it made for a random burger that sunk in my stomach. The platter deals are a great price at $11.99. You get a 1/2 burger (ask for a bun if you want one.), a side of fries or onion rings, a signature dipping sauce, and a choice of a side salad or coleslaw. I got mine with grilled onions, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, peppers, A1 steak sauce, and horseradish. It was ok in flavor, but the patty fell apart. The horseradish does not deliver the kick I had hoped for either. The buns are big and soft. I could only eat the bottom piece because it was too much. The fries were seasoned well, but soggy. The salad was impressive. It was a mound of mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, croutons, olives, cheese and slice carrots. Way better than most burger places. The balsamic dressing was delicious. I shared the sides with a friend and was beyond stuffed. 

Although their shakes and desserts sound amazing, there was no room for anything else.Got some burgers for takeout... Saw that it was supposedly the best burger in 29 cities and it had great Yelp reviews.  I'm not sure which cities this statistic is referring to, but I've had much better burgers in Las Vegas alone.  The really awesome thing is that they have different sized burgers, so you can get a small (5 oz) or extremely large (20 oz) burger and put almost anything you want on it.  They have toppings I would never think try, like artichoke hearts, banana peppers, etc.  They have several different types of cheese including feta, mozzarella, provolone, etc.  Unfortunately I wasn't feeling too adventurous so I got the Semi-Serious (1/3 lb burger) with bleu cheese, 2 onion rings, bbq sauce and lettuce.  The burger was good, a little bit chunky for me on the meat for me, I probably should have gone with the smallest burger.  My boyfriend ordered a medium burger and it was delivered well done, but still good.  The fries were pretty good, I wouldn't RAVE about them, but they were good. I've never had fries with the skin still on them, and they were pretty tasty with the seasonings.

I'd like to try the milkshake and onion rings and probably be more adventurous with my burger next time, I would definitely try this place again and I'd say everyone is different when it comes to burgers, so this place is worth a try.50s Diner likened to Johnny Rockets and Ruby's, but smaller and more expensive.  

After a long day of moving, the guys picked up burgers and one of the best CHICKEN SANDWICHES ever.  Tender, succulent chicken breast on a great big bun.  Good big ONION RINGS and an astounding list of flavors for thick shakes!  Thankful for the HALF SIZE SHAKES at $3.99.  This place would make a good fit in an airport... except for the wait.  Eh, not so much.  Better just stay where it is and keep it to ourselves.  and on Yelp.  

Very friendly and helpful staff.  Monkey will most likely end up here again.cute oasis of a boutique on Mill - Pitaya is a fantastic wardrobe save - perfect for last-minute change of plans, easily can assemble a range of looks from Pitaya w/o hurting your wallet.  decent selection of accessories

some eye-catching finds:
pale aqua lace leggings
red sailor-esque sheath w/brass buttons, exposed zipper, pockets
billowy skirt, full waist Lush ballerina frocks in magenta and indigo

4-star overall easy to browse, great staff/vibe, reasonably priced
3-star labels/quality - decent but not life-alteringBeen here a few times for HH in the bar.  It was ok.  Since we are sitting in the bar on the sofas, we seems to be forgotten by the server.  We had to remind the server a few times on refills.  

The food has been ok.  Nothing special.  The Fried Tofu was surprising the best dish we had.  

We tried the:
Gyoza Dumping - OK tasting
Sesame Chicken - OK
Yakitori - Good the mariate was just right
BBQ Beef Ribs - Not bad at all

The other had sushi and they said it was ok.Kabuki does not serve unforgettable food, but it's convenient and good enough to come back now and then. Their Dynamite, Vegas, and Alaskan rolls are my favorite. I would stay away from the the Lobster and Rose roll- bland and does not look appealing. I like my sushi with some kind of presentation. Don't forget to order dessert! I always get the green tea tempura ice cream, which is scrumptious!!Nice place for what a pizza place has to offer.

$8.95 for a Balsamic Grilled Chicken Salad (that can feed 2 if your ordering pizza etc.) You can get the $14.95 plate. Maybe that feeds 4?

$9.95 for the Margherita: Roma Tomatoes, Garlic, Fresh Basil.
Tasty good. Asked for extra garlic didn't seem to make it on this order. Or it could be the Garlic Cheese Bread ($5.95) was head & shoulders more "garlicy" so the pizza paled in comparison?

Before, I have tasted some left over Thai Chicken pizza that was in the fridge at home, it was very tasty. Will try it fresh out the oven eventually.

 The Messy Sundae ($8.50)
My visit was for a B-Day. (FREE they said on B-Day) 
This is a Very Tall (stands what looked like 1-1/2 ft.) sundae glass cascading with chocolate over a couple of scoops of icecream.
It was fine finish to the stay!

Mixed bag as far as customers go, the retired, the first date, the small family, even a table of kids babysitting themselves. 

Kids Menu available.

Wait staff is on it. 
Lets call this a Pizza Restaurant with polished details and an upscale menu. Check it out. 3 other Las Vegas location with another opening soon S.Rainbow. And 10 more in SoCal.

Only thing I noticed, at least for this time of year, the Sun crashes through the windows from off to the left. So be aware. They have blinds but I noticed that those annoying little streaks still get through for some time.

I'll check it out again and get better layout details. for ya'all.

Back again.

Kids wars. Cell Phone wars. wtf!?
Salad was nice again.
Thia Chicken Pizza was good indeed.
Of all things to order someone got a Pepperoni. Looked like shit. Kinda pooled up some oil. Yay, lunch tomorrow. 

I guess if you stick with things that you can't get at Pizza Hut your ok here. Duck Tacos for one.........next time, next timeBeautiful view, outdated decor, decent food
I ate lunch here one day during my conference.  We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful view.  The food was decent - we both tried the chicken mole special.  The decor is definitely outdated...this restaurant might be more of a destination if they did some updates.Nothing real exciting to report, as the WMN contains the usual grocery store items--produce, meats, dairy, baked goods, frozen items, alcohol, cleaning supplies, personal hygiene products, etc.  

A few distinguishing 'wow' factors:

1. Freshly made sushi rolls, which are fantastic and priced @ least $1 less than the other supermarket chains.  As I contemplated over spicy salmon vs crunchy shrimp rolls, I was offered samples of both by the sushi prep team, to aid in my evaluation.

2. Red Box dispenser near the entrance/exit.  Now, $1 DVD rentals are within 4 blocks of my house--yea!

3.  I haven't used either service but noticed a drive-thru pharmacy and photo center.

I hope this Walmart will remain unscathed by characteristics that plague many other stores over time--uncleanliness and annoyed staff.We ate here for the first time on a Friday night. It was busy but we were able to get a table right away. After we were seated, we waited for about 20 minutes until we were helped. I think there were circumstances that made some of their wait staff unavailable for a bit but it was still unfortunate. Once we ordered, our food took a little while to come out. The food itself was pretty good. I wasn't crazy about my soup but my husband's noodle dish was good and our friend's Pad Thai was excellent. Because of the service issue, I'm not sure we would go out of our way to return here. Overall, it was an ok experience.Never have had bad sushi here and they usually have good deals or happy hour specials. They have a quiet atmosphere and no load annoying music or crowd. On Sunday's they even play football on their bar TV so I can sneak in a few good looks on my date night with the wife. The service has always been good, minus the one time we had a waiter standing on the seat next to me to try and close the blinds and start cleaning up. It made things a little awkward but other than that we have been regulars here and it's always been a good experience.I finally got to eat at BLT Burger on a recent trip to LV.  I had originally tried to go there back in July 2008 when we had tickets to LOVE, but there was some sort of incident that closed the restaurant down and we had to find another option.  It had remained on my radar ever since though.

We went on a Monday evening, arriving something between 8:30 - 9:00 p.m.  I was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait.  We also got a nice table right by the breezeway, which led to some nice people watching and a game I like to call 'real or fake'.  

The service was good all-around, quick, friendly and the server even was kind enough to fake laugh at some of my jokes.  I ordered the #2 combo, which is a basic burger (with cheddar), fries (waffle style) and a milkshake (nut job).  The burger was good, but nothing particularly stood out about it.  The waffle fries were below average, a little too much seasoning I though.  The milkshake tasted pretty good, but the one problem with it was that it came with two HUGE straws (if you've ever been to Panera Bread and gotten a frozen drink, like that, but I think bigger).  I didn't try, but I'm pretty sure I literally could have fit three regular sized straws within this straw.  Anyways, the straw sucked, and not in the good way, I wasn't even able to get all the milkshake from the glass.  I also tried one of the wife's onion rings and it was average at best.

The remainder of the party was basically 'meh' about this place.  I didn't think it was a great value, but we were in Vegas, so what can you expect.  I can't imagine going back there when there are so many other restaurants I'd like to try in Vegas.  Solid three.Cooked to perfection, but you will feel like a giant if you eat there because the burgers are so tiny that they feel like you got the bite size version. I guess this wouldn't be so bad if I were on a diet, but what made it worse it that the burger cost $13. 

SO either you leave hungry or you spend $26 and get two burgers. 

The pickles were really good.BLT Burger is located in the Mirage. Every time I walked past this restaurant during my stay in Vegas, this place seemed pretty busy.  So my husband and I decided to try it out.  Prices are a bit high for my taste but I guess they are average for Vegas.  Burgers range from $16-20.  Burgers do not come with a side. it's an additional charge, about $5 for fries. 

It took a while for our food to come out but when it did, it was nice and hot. Burgers were pretty sizable. I ordered the turkey burger because I am not big on red meat.  It was ok.  I would not order it again though.  My husband ordered the wagyu beef burger which is top notch meat.  He said it was the best burger he had ever had and he even wanted to come back the next night.  I would come back again, but not in the same week.we went there on a Saturday afternoon  on 8/1/09 and were prepared not to be able to get a reservation that day for an indoor gondola as it's 106 degrees outside but yup, we got it for 6:30pm :)
get there about 10minutes early.
we paid for a private ride indoors for the two of us $64.  it's about 20mins long.  if i knew they would not take my camera and take pictures for us, we would have opted for the $16pp and shared it with two other ppl as they can take pictures for me and I would them.
it was a nice ride with our guide with the fake accent roll us thru the canals of the Venetian hotel and then sang about 4 songs.  for a minute there, i didnt feel like i was in a hotel/casino but somewhere else...like Venice :)  
it's a one and done kind of deal that my hubby agreed to do with me.Like many of the Indian/ethnic restaurants in town, its not much to look at.  In fact when I rolled up into the Big Lots! strip mall, it looked closed from the outside.  However, we braved it anyway and boy am I glad we did.  
We ordered veggie samosas (delicious filling, the skin was a little on the thicker side like some of the egg rolls in Chinese buffets, but that didn't distract from the tastiness of it)
The chutneys were some of the best and freshest I've tasted in a long time.
The Chicken Tikka Masala was rich and creamy just the way I like it.  We ordered also the Lamb Roshan Josh (spelling?) which was amazing.  I usually order Lamb Vindaloo but will be eating this from now on.
The garlic naan was buttery and flavorful.
The naan filled with lamb was only okay, half of the pieces didn't actually have lamb in it.  The cheese pakoras were bland.  I will say that the rice was tasty but was a little harder than I'm used too.
Overall, a solid takeout place if you don't want to eat in the restaurant.  The spiciness really does love up to the scales.  A medium, really does have a nice slow chilli burn without being overpowering.  The portions were on the smallish side, but no smaller than lots of other Indian restaurants.  Definately worth checking out.I wish the Michelin Guide would come back to Las Vegas to rate restaurants, as Joel Robuchon unfortunately seems to be resting on its laurels (its 3 stars were awarded in 2009). The food and overall ambiance were stellar, but the service the night we went was quite lacking. Seems there was some breakdown of communication among the multitude of staff, which left less time for basic service items (empty drinks, checking in, asking about dishes, etc.).

All in all a pleasant experience, but really not one worthy of Michelin stars. Happy to pay for restaurants when everything is above and beyond, but this experience just ended a little flat.We came at about the same day and time again. This time there was a different mgr with mostly the same set of issues. 

1. No crayons and kids menu. 
2. Waited 15 mins when told 5. 
3. LOTS of empty seating. 

Mgr came over and had a different set of circumstances for what the issue was today.  Mostly people calling in sick. 

The server and food was perfect as always!Can I just say I hate waiting in those stupid lines to get into a club?  Ugh! 

Well, the girls in our group had those "Ladies Free" passes, so we knew we weren't going to have to pay.  Now, where do we get these passes?  There are usually some random guys standing near the entrances of the Mirage scoping out the ladies and handing the passes out to them.  

The guys in our group, now that was another story.  We heard the cover was $20 for them, but some guy was meandering his way through the line selling those "Guys Free" passes for $10.  Of course, we knew he was making total profit.  But do we care?  Or course not!  We're saving $10!  I have no idea where they were giving these passes out, but this guy had a grip of them and he was making his way through the line selling them.  And so, that's how the guys in our group got their $10 passes.

When we finally made our way through one line, we discovered there was yet another line across the way.  *sigh*  Not fun.  When we FINALLY got into the club, it was a pretty large space.  Very rectangular-ish with the dance floor in the middle, with booths and stripper poles too.  There's a bar that lines up against the side and a few smaller rooms to dance in too.  

After a quick survey of the place, we danced a bit.  There's not a whole lot of room to dance with all those private booths smack down in the dance floor.  There are definitely a lot more guys just watching the 'hired dancers' up on the platforms and the 'regular girls' by the strip poles if anything.  Uh, hello...I'm coming here to dance.  But not these guys....they are purely here to look and gawk. 

The ladies' room is super dark.  And I think the music is even louder in the actual bathrooms that outside in the hallway.  

There are absolutely no places for you to sit or rest, unless you have paid for one of those private booths.  Should you find a 'seat' anywhere, security will be quick to ask you to move and stand where you were just sitting.  

I think I left after spending less than an hour there.  And it wasn't even a good hour. I spent more time wandering around checking the place out and looking for the rest of our party.

Unless I get a private booth and have a pass to jump the line, you probably won't see me at this club again.  

As I recall, the drinks were damn expensive too.Place is ok if you want to buy moonshine. I couldn't believe they do not have bud select there. Prices are a little higher than grocery store.I tried this place with my dad the other day, trying to discover some other non-AYCE places aside from Watami. I've still yet to try Tomu; that's gonna be my next stop when I have time.

This place, in terms of overall quality and presentation, isn't bad. However, I had a few concerns. The prices for the rolls vs. the amount you get + the tastiness seem to not match very well. It's basically just so-so, and for me so-so doesn't cut it when rolls are $10+ an order. The seafood pancake thingy was a huge disappointment. A lot of pancake, very little seafood. The soup was good, but they went too hard on the vinegar for the salad, so it tasted quite sour.

Service was good though, and ambience as well. It also had more options than Watami, but for the amount I'm paying, I think Watami has higher quality food.

Maybe when I try Tomu one day...I didn't go back again.  The haircut turned out to be worse than I thought, being quite unmanageable.  I ended up going back to the local Mexican barber, who charged 12 bucks for a pretty decent haircut.

I think they gave better massages than they did haircuts.  Still, it wasn't a bad place, and one could do worse.After a day of driving from LA to PHX, I needed a good unwind and stretch. Sunday morning flow sounded like a great idea, and this place seemed like the right place to go.

The class was described as a level 2-3, which sounded more intimidating than it turned out to be. It was slower paced than I'm used to, and not super hard IMO. The instructor was a sub and although he suggested modifications, didn't seem to do much hands-on adjusting with the students which I usually like. 

Either way, the class was good for the $10 student admission fee I paid. But if this was located in LA, I probably wouldn't go since there are much better (and more challenging) classes at home. Call me a LA yoga snob (#dontcare).Came in here for dinner.  I wasn't too impressed about the whole place.  The staff was very good, I watched a customer in front of me heckling the girl behind the counter about the details about all burgers and chicken sandwiches.  After I ordered, they kept informing me that my order was coming up.  Food was okay; main things to order is the burgers with the different meats they have to offer.  Bit pricey for a burger.

I gave this place 3 Stars because of the ammenities bar.  I ordered a side of chili cheese fries and was able to pump some extra cheese onto my fries.  You can choose what you want to put on your burger; whole bar full of lettuces, pickles, onions, etc.  Basically, it's build your perfect burger.

Sitting area was okay, seat yourself.  You can choose to throw away your trash or leave it there.  Place was clean when I found a spot to sit down.

Parking is not a problem since it's in the same location as Target.I've only eaten dinner here, I have not gone to the club, so if you want a club review, read another review.

Dinner here was perfectly adequate for an Italian restaurant, however it was nothing special.  Price wise, I would say that this place is rather overpriced, as I don't feel the meal we had was worth it.  Also, the waiters can be kind of iffy, which I felt was a shame.

The portions are large, but not family style large.  My cousin and I split two appetizers and one main and were plenty full.  Decent wine list, but I would actually expect something better for an Italian restaurant on the Strip.

Overall, was perfectly fine, but nothing special.  I'd say save your money and go elsewhere.The meatball really is to die for and I loved that it came out really hot. The only drawbacks were that the garlic bread they give to each table is really sub standard...like the kind you buy frozen at the grocery store and that the rigatoni in my rigatoni with sausage was undercooked. I don't mind al dente, but crunchy pasta may be pushing it! I'd got back for the wine, the meatball and the atmosphere....maybe next time the Sexy Siren show that you can see across from the patio won't be cancelled!Cute little restaurant, emphasis on little. Great rolls to start.... they have been dredged in olive oil but I still dipped them in olive oil and grated parmesan. I ordered the linguine filet mignon bolognese and I have to admit it was pretty good. I would give it 3.50 for the food alone. I have to knock off a half star because of the environment. Ambiance is nice and quaint but one of the waiters was pretty snippy with his fellow staff and b/c the place is soooo small it was hard to ignore. At one point it was uncomfortable but it seems that they were oblivious. 

Would I come back? YesOkay, Okay!!  2.5 stars rounded up. I can't give more, I'm sorry.

True, my clothes came out very very nice and I'm also having a skirt altered at Organic Cleaners but to be honest, I'm scared that the alteration may cost more than the damn skirt.  I went in to pick up my things this morning and a big fat "what the fuck" bomb flew out of my mouth when I saw the price. It was nauseating. 

I really don't understand how my unlined, very basic pencil skirt costs more to clean than a men's dress shirt with french cuffs, (a whole 4.00 MORE)  but whatever. Why does my button down blouse cost 4.40 and your shit costs 2.40??? Because it says "Ladies Blouse" in your stupid system?? Suck one!! 
I dropped mad skrilla on fucking dry cleaning and I'm not happy about it. 

I'm gonna go grab some pork rinds and a 40oz. of Mickey's and cool off.Came here after a movie for a light bite and drinks. We tried Grape right after it opened and weren't impressed, but it's been open a while now and we wanted to give it another shot. Anyway, ordered a couple glasses of wine, the garlic hummus, a chicken quesadilla and a roasted tomato and spinach flatbread. There was a different flatbread we really wanted, but it had a bleu cheese which neither me or the bf like and when we asked the waiter if we could sub a different cheese he said no, because it wouldn't melt right. That seemed a bit strange to me, since there are several other flatbreads on the menu with all different cheeses that manage to melt. When the food came out super fast it made me think everything it pre-made and nuked to order. Everything was pretty mediocre and the wines by the glass all seem pretty spendy to me...you would think a wine bar would have more variety. Our waiter was very on top of things and kept the water glasses full, so I gotta bump up a star for that. The atmosphere is cool so it's disappointing that the food isn't better.Lemme preface this with: I'm from San Jose, CA aka Silicon Valley. Land of the computer nerds and tech geeks. Just south of perpetually gloomy SF where it is considered amazing nice weather when it hits 70 and there is a sliver of sun peeking through the fog/clouds. 

Ok now that we understand the context, lets move onto the review.

The only place I've been to for pool parties in Vegas and in my mind, that's totally excusable because, well... it's Vegas!!! So when The Boyfriend (and his buddies) decided to book a room here for access to their pool and reputable pool party, I was game. 

The hotel itself is super trendy, with a clean and contemporary looking decor. Obviously, it attracts a certain kind of crowd - young, single, trendy, and mostly good looking people. Most of the girls I saw there were blue eyed, platinum blond, petite girls with loads of makeup, high heels, and wearing tiny little pieces of clothe I can only assume were shorts, skirts, or dresses of some sort. The men were cut, tanned, and sporting their stunna shades indoors. 

The room we had had a good view of the pool (the main attraction for the weekend) and consisted of 2 double beds. It was a bit smaller than a regular room, but not horribly cramped. 

The only thing I did NOT like about this hotel room was their bathroom set up. The toilet and shower each had their own door, but the separating doors were made of a hazy glass like material and the only thing separating you from the beds was a thin sliding door, which is very shadow see-through. Also there were no windows in the bathroom area and no fan in the toilet area, which can get uncomfortable for the only girl staying in the same room with her boyfriend and his 2 friends... especially when the girl's body and digestive system is extremely regular, if you get my drift.

Anyway, onto the pool party...
It starting getting poppin' around 1pm. There are plenty of tables for your reserving pleasure and well as a few chairs to lay out in, if you can snag one in time. There are 2 bars, a dj area, and a small pool where most of the tiny, blond girls and gym rat guys stand around in. Although I'm not a huge fan of pool parties, I will admit it did feel good to be in the pool in the ridiculously hot AZ weather!!

I realize this review was long, but... just making sure you get the 411, yo!if they didn't have a cool ass sale going on 2 for $30, i'd give this place a 2 stars. the service sucked here. i wasn't even greeted when i came in. not once was asked if i needed help. i had to ask the price on some of the shirts. i experienced way better at the SF one even though the service there sucked too. the only time their service turned great is when you're in the counter purchasing their clothes. i don't think i'll ever come here again. not worth my timeI've stopped at the bar a few times after work to wet my whistle. It's never the destination, but usually the stepping stone. It is a hotel bar after all, but an upscale one at that. I like the tranquility and openness of it. 

The happy hour drink menu is great, and it's a big reason why I come back. $5 for house wines and mid-ranged spirits, $3 for microbrews, and decently priced bar snacks.

The bartenders are pretty spot on. Very friendly and personable. The pretty girl behind the bar last night made a really nice AZ Hickory Smoked Old Fashion. It was very mellow, and she didn't put too much bitters in it as to make it too spicy on the way down--an issue I've been encountering across town. I wish I could remember their names, but if they had nametags I'm sure that wouldn't be an issue. I'm sure they would be very happy with new uniforms too. Come on meow, a uniform upgrade is definitely overdue.Went here with my girlfriend on a Friday night after 10 PM.  It looked dead.  We were looking for some fun and excitement but the place sucked and our waitress looked tired and bored.  My girlfriend looks way hotter than any of the girls here so there was nothing really much to look at.  We cancelled our drink order and left.I'm a person who loves deals and coupons and tries to get the best price for everything. I somehow got a coupon for this taxi service that was $2 off of a $10 ride or $5 off a $25 ride. I figured that when I first came to Tucson the taxi ride was a little over $30 so this coupon would be useful when going back to the airport at the end of my trip. The receptionist at my hotel called the taxi for me and then I got in the cab. The driver was very friendly and we had a nice conversation throughout the whole ride. 

Here comes my big complaint though...when we pulled up my taxi fare showed as $24.50 on the screen. "Are you freaking kidding me!". Seriously you can't round it up to $25 or just drive in another circle to make it meet that goal. I gave him the coupon and he said he could only take off $2. If i had just made another stop light I would have gotten $5 off. How annoying. So instead of paying $20 before tip I had to pay $22.50. Yes I am a big baby for that little few dollars. I am glad though that it was cheaper going back to the airport than from it and the man was friendly as well. He didn't have change for $100 though and so I had to run in real fast to grab it. If I paid with credit card he said he couldn't put the discount. Its ok. The taxi did come fast after being called and it was a smooth ride so I guess he was following the rules and I thank him for the drive.I wasn't too impressed with the meat here. It seems that all the brazilian bbq places I've gone to over the last 5 years have progressively gotten worse in their quality. It's either too dry, or too salty. Maybe the meat isn't so good. 

My fave cut is usually the Picanha. I wasn't too impressed. 

I think my fave item was the quinoa salad (i know, i know), and the cheese. Service was good, and the place is ginormous. I'm not sure if I'll go back if I had a choice.I ordered the pad-see-ew which is like pad thai but with really wide noodles. I found it to just taste peppery and didn't like it much. I'd give it 2 stars for that.
But my wife ordered the penang curry and that was mighty tasty. I'd give that 4 stars.  So, I'll just split the difference and give it 3 overall.

A tip: Soda is just a buck, but they bring you a can with a cup of ice instead of filling a cup from a soda fountain.This place is aight, I didn't love it and I didn't hate it. The menu isn't terrible and the service is good. It's basically like an upscale sports bar I suppose. 

I had the ahi tuna sandwich with seasonal veggies (green beans and red peppers...yum).I was going back and forth with a 2 star or 3 star review but decided based on the atmosphere and quality of food. This was my second time here and I felt they deserved a review. The food I am not particularly impressed with. The first visit I tried the BBQ pizza and caesar salad which I can say was not memorable or flavorful. The second visit we had the lobster crab dip, angel hair pasta and margherita pizza. All were very bland. It is a nice spot if your in the area but I wouldn't expect anything out of the ordinary when it comes to the food.First off I have to say the food was excellent.  I had the Cuban sandwich with potato salad.  The service was horrible that is why I rated this 3 stars. The waitress I had was terrible.  She was not knowledge when I asked about things she said she didn't know instead of going to find out.  I also saw her smelling the drinks that grossed me out. To top it off she over charged us $6 when I brought this to the attention of the owner he told us we had to talk to the waitress.  If I go back I will order to go.Went here at 7 pm on a Saturday night for my 30th birthday dinner (followed by drinks at Hanny's). I really wanted to try this place after hearing so much about it. We had a reservation for 25 people. We called a few times before hand and were originally told we could have a back room that holds 25 people. So, we went ahead and planned the night with that in mind. When we called back a few days later, we were told it could only hold 22 people but we were assured our reservation was on the books for the back room. The night we showed up, we were told it could only hold 18 people and they seated us two different tables in the main dinning room. When we brought the discrepancy to the hostess's attention, she basically gave us the attitude that since we didn't talk to her when we called, then it wasn't her problem and that was pretty much the end of the discussion. I was not thrilled about the change in plans and everyone seated at different tables but we made it work. Had we known that was going to be the case in the first place, we would never have made the reservation there so that was pretty annoying. We knew the place was small so that is why we called ahead to make sure they could accommodate us. Anyway, I digress. We made it work and had a great time. 

The menu was eclectic and served the needs of the carnivores and vegetarians in the group. The food is served in small plates that usually has 4-5 pieces on it. The service was pretty good considering the size of our group and they were good about allowing people to have different checks. The food was really yummy - I highly recommend the a fried fish offering (an off the menu item our waitress was nice enough to tell us about) as well as the Gyoza Soup. The decor was beautiful and hip. There is one unisex bathroom behind a red curtain. We also loved the drink menu. It had pages and pages of cool drinks and cold Sakes. We liked it here but do not suggest it for groups larger than 4 people.I had lunch here and had the sashimi tuna salad. It was fresh and tasty. I also ordered the miso soup which was actually quite good. Real chopped mushrooms and scallions and it wasn't too salty. It didn't taste like standard powdered miso that you would get at an average japanese restaurant. I also tried the cucumber lemonade which was quite good. Overall the service was attentive and our food came out promptly. My coworker had the seared tuna sliders and sweet potato hash which he looked pleased with. The portions were perfect for what we were in the mood for which was just something really light. It's a great place for lunch, the ambiance is nice especially if you're sitting on the patio. I'm not a huge fan of fusion style restaurants so it gets a 3 star rating out of me, but it's a nice place for a quick healthy meal if you're in the area.3 1/2 stars. Brought some clients in for lunch since they picked Ping Pong Thai. This was my first visit here and we arrived before the lunch hour which was a blessing BC it gets busy after the noon hour.

Started off with a Thai Ice Tea - large and refreshing. I went with the soft tofu Pad Se Ew and requested no broccoli. The food arrived promptly although they included broccoli! I blew it off and didn't make a stink about it but even my client mentioned he heard my request. The dish was still tasty and filling so I  was content.

This is my clients go to place since it's near their office so I'll return again here and give em another try.Tried Ronnie's for the first time today.  Never would have noticed it without Yelp review.  Good service.  Good food.  Awesome potatoes.  Bacon sadly was overcooked.  Will take kids there and see what their opinion is since they are pickier than me:)This is one of my favourite pubs. It's the Best Pub in the Stockbridge area and definitely in the top 5 of Edinburgh best mainly due to their burgers, drinks and atmosphere (what else do you need on a pub right? . Usually we go there with mates for drinks. This time, guess what (as a visitor) I took another Yelp member and went there for Breakfast. Scottish Traditional breakfast during a very aggressive hangover from last night.  Food very well prepared, arrived really fast and it was tasty. 2 Full breakfasts + 2 Black Coffees = £19
Very friendly staff.The Ettrick is... fine.  It has some definite good points as well as definite bad points.

It has a good beer garden, this is great for those 3.5 sunny/warm days that happen in the summer.  
It has (from distant memory) totally reasonable pub food.  It will fill your belly with stodge to soak up the beer.
It shows major sporting matches (or at least, it showed the tennis when Andy Murray was playing last year).  This isn't a draw for me, but likely is for some.
... Ok I can't think of any other good points.

The bad...
It's pretty off the beaten track.  If you want to go anywhere else before or after the Ettrick, be prepared for the longest walk between pubs in all of Scotland (and by that I mean, like, 15 minutes).  
It doesn't have the best transport links, so see point above re: how long it will take to get to a reasonable bus stop.
It's FULL OF REALLY OLD MEN.

I don't have a problem with old man pubs but this takes it further than I think I'm willint to go.  I'm 29 and I'm pretty sure I was the youngest person there.  Ok yes I'm a child, but probably about 30% of the clientele were in the 70-100 range, 60% were in the 40-70 range, and 10% in the 29-40 range.  
I'm not even kidding.  

To be fair, I think there was some kind of old man convention going on or something, as they were all wearing the same tie, but it was a bit excessive.  

If you must come here, do it during the day when it's quieter.In all honesty, I don't generally find Lothian Road public houses particularly enthralling, because a lot of them seem to float around the same level in terms of banter and atmosphere. There's nothing essentially wrong with some of the pubs, they've just not got the kind of vibe going on that I usually go for, plus I think there are far superior areas to go drinking in.

Saying that, Shakespeare's is a perfectly decent pub to grab yourself a beverage in, and it's really conveniently located for a pre or post event drink if you're going to the nearby Traverse Theatre, or heading to a gig at the HMV Picture House a few doors up the road. Shakespeare's seems to have been around a lot longer than some of the other places that have come and gone on Lothian Road, or at least changed their name, so it must be doing something right. The place seems to have a good number of regulars in attendance, being your average, laid back pub with no pretensions, which is always a bonus if you're just wanting to relax and have a good gab over a pint.Thanks for the diabetes!

This place had the potential to be my second home when I first heard about it. I'm a chocolate addict, If i could inject it into my veins I would.

But the main problem with this place is that it's full of the one group in society that needs chocolate more than anyone else...

Menopausal women.

The group of 40 somethings next to me were , for an hour, talking about why their daughters don't listen to them and won't go out dancing with them (I could have answered that one...) The 3 most common words you'll hear in this place are "Oh...My...God" with the appropriate pauses in between when they stuff their faces. If you're looking for quiet afternoon, don't come here.

Whoever was supervising the staff was giving them such a hard time, i can't believe the other reviewers saw the same thing too. Somebody has a little attitude problem.I made the classic mistake of getting really excited about visiting somewhere I'd passed however many times in the past and been curious about, because I do tend to get overly enthusiastic about anywhere that's kind of hidden away down a street, and seems exclusive to people in the know.

That much is true about Star Bar, because you have to wander pretty deep into the new town to find it. There's definitely not a chance of just stumbling upon the bar randomly if you're roaming the main hostelries on George Street and surrounding roads. 

The pub/bar looks like a very inviting little place indeed from the outside, kind of like a twinkling golden light in a sea of residential darkness, the north star which leads the way to boozing goodness and all that jazz. It is pretty cool inside, with its green padded seating and upper level feeling a bit like someone's sprawling living room. I was in here on a Friday night, and the whole experience was somewhat like being at someone's house party, a vibe I quite like because it felt very chilled, and like you could perch anywhere, and the high student population in here added to the very relaxed drinking feel too.

I did enjoy having a few in Star Bar, and there wasn't anything present to offend me whatsoever, I think I just got my expectation levels a bit overexcited for my first visit. I think a return evaluation is needed, which could perhaps involve a visit to the beer garden if the weather continues to be sunny, or a trip to see one of the live acts that play here.If I'm being honest, I've never been inside, yet managed drinks here on two separate occasions!  I will say that I like the amount of outdoor seating it has...  there is something about outdoor drinking that I like...whether it is at night before trekking onto another watering hole or a midday drink.  That being said, it would be nice to see something other than the betting place across the way.  The drinks must've been a reasonable price as the guy I was with at the time didn't seem to complain and let's just say he keeps a tight budget.  Also like that while it is just down the street from where I usually stay, it is also near other bars and restaurants so it makes for a convenient stop on the drinking trail.Let me first say, we were wearied, hungry and circled the town several times before stopping here. It was late and most Edinburgh restaurants stop serving dinner at 10 PM. We snuck in because it was close to our fantastic hotel - Missoni. So the food was no great shakes but not as horrible as other reviewers write. I had poached salmon with boiled veggies and man had spicy chicken something. Both good and not overpowering for a late night meal. We had a bottle of the Maxie's house red. Good for the price. The interior was small ans quaint; a little stone-walled, candle-lit room with a medieval charm. Nice terrace, too. What really stood out was the service. Sweet little cherubs served us with smiles and willingly provided tips for fun stuff to do during our stay. We hung quite awhile and relaxed, chatting with the staff and other guests. I would recommend for late-night meals after a long day of travel or sunny terrace pint stops.  We're told it rains more than not in Edinburgh so give it a shot on a sunny day. Staff easily gets 5 stars, ambiance 4 stars, food 3. Last note - one of the sweet cherubs tried to tell us we gave too much money, to which we replied, nope we thoroughly enjoyed it. Cheers!We stopped in here for lunch on our last day in Edinburgh. The reviews on Yelp looked good, and I love great Mexican, so why not?

We ordered a pitcher of margaritas. We forgot to mention we like it on the rocks, so they were with crushed ice instead of ice cubes. The flavor was alright. More lemony than I'm used to my margaritas being, but not terrible enough to not drink them!

For lunch, we split an order of Haggis nachos (not traditionally Mexican, but sometimes you have to try the fusion) with a side of the extra hot salsa. For our mains, I had the chile verde pork Chimichanga and the other half had the beef Enchiladas.

How was the food? Yeah it was good. Not great, but good. The nachos were tasty, but the extra hot salsa was barely medium in my book. Good flavor, but far from the "extra hot" the menu was claiming it to be. The mains were alright too. The beef was better than the pork (in my opinion) and I used the rest of the extra hot salsa to spice up my Chimichanga a bit.

Overall, it was decent Mexican (considering it's in the UK, where a lot of stuff is terrible). I would have preferred it hotter. Given the national dish of the UK is curry (or so some claim), I would expect that people here would like their Mexican a bit hotter. Unfortunately, the waitress claims that people really don't want any spice in their Mexican at all. Maybe these are the people who order Korma at the curry house. I don't know.

I'd probably go back if I were in Edinburgh, and I were with people who wanted to go. The lunch prices were fantastic (£5.75 for the mains, and about £4.50 for the nachos we split), and the food was decent. However, if this is the best Mexican in Edinburgh as some of the other reviews claim, then Edinburgh is in dire need of something better.First trip to this Edinburgh eaterie. Nice friendly welcome, taken straight to our table and service spot on from then.
One of our party is vegetarian and has a nut allergy but no problem to the waiter, new all the dishes,which our friend could have and couldn't, a refreshing change to  a lot of places!
Food really tasty, good selection and timing good.
RecommendMy local takeaway and very hit or miss!

The prices are excellent for what you get and although I've yet to have a *bad* meal from here, there is really absolutely no consistency to their offering.

I'm a pretty simple gal when it comes to my tastes with Indian food and although I'll occasionally wander off piste I more often than not order the same thing. As such I've had a pretty good litmus test over the past year for that lack of consistency - sometimes my chicken passanda is lovely and creamy with a thick sauce that's just made for dipping naan bread in, and sometimes it's incredibly watery and soupy.

Likewise, the peshwari naan wobbles about from divine to woeful. On a good day the inside will be beautifully coated, bright orange and so flavoursome you almost don't want to dip it in anything, whereas other times it looks like they just threw some dessicated coconut inside as an afterthought.

A lot of this seems to be down to the day of the week, with weekends having the stronger serving, but I really wish they could just nail this all week round.

Although I've ordered takeaway from the Raj, I doubt I'd ever choose to have a sit down meal there. The decor is incredibly tired and a bit grubby. It's not often very busy either which does bring the ambiance down a little. It could probably do with some background music to try to perk the place up a bit.

They could also do with installing a till system. They simply tot up your order using a menu and a calculator and I don't think I've been quoted the same price for the same meal more than once!

In summary, amazing food at weekends and a fab price, but pretty woeful otherwise.Go for the kitsch factor. Take a coat, pay the cheapest entry price, have one drink and jet. They don't let you take your cell phones in to take pics but paying for the professional photo option isn't worth it.We ate here twice since we were staying upstairs, and it just wasn't as good as we wanted it to be. The taco sampler my husband ordered was the best meal overall, but the Taco Bell-like nachos and chopped salad disaster really bummed us out. 

Good thing we saw Jamie Lee Curtis later!Guess what this shop sells?

OK enough with the name-pun it's actually a pretty cool shop, especially for people who like me have a small obsession with the tick-tock machines. 

Great for a present, but my does it come from a price.
Once when I was in here just looking around with my friend I felt the guy sitting at the till was scanning us as soon as we entered the store and we shuffled out soon after that. Something must have ticked him off . (ha ha Anna). Perhaps I overreacted from the combination of multiple ticking sounds and his obviously bad mood. 

It's a tiny shop mind you but very dedicated to watches and quirky clocks. A nice chain from the chain shops and another individual shop to add to the area as well.I stumbled across this stationery shop during one of those aimless walks down town. 

I was surprised at just how many postcards they stock. Other than that, they've got a good range of your typical stationery items. I personally don't get a kick from going into detail about pens, glue and paper, so I'll leave you to picture what they sell.

The lady who was on duty was extremely friendly, and we had a nice chat before I left, empty handed! It's the reason I like the independent stores in Edinburgh, and Marchmont in particular; it's such a relaxed part of town.Nestled among a line of independent bookstores, you'll find Andrew Pringle.  Focusing more on the older or antiquated books this is the bookshop for those who like books that appear to have a reasonable degree of history behind them - I love these types of books (each one of them feels as if they have their own story).

For those to whom this is of interest there are a few first edition books here, but to me personally these aren't worth the extra money - I couldn't care less if they were first or last off the press.  That said, the books here are worth looking through especially with so many neighbouring bookshops.Liberation is a very gimmicky shop specialising in affordable, generic logo tees and poster art.

When you walk in you're hit with just about every popular cultural icon under the sun, from the imitation Andy Warhol depiction of Marilyn Monroe to Darth Vader. There are enough Superman hoodies in here to clothe the East of Scotland and Star Wars jumpers for people who want it to be known that they've seen the movie.

I don't like to be judgemental but it's the kind of place for kids who want to display things they love on their torso so everyone knows they are informed about popular culture. That's enough of my pop psychology, but you know there are going to be predictable Tarantino t shirts in here before you've even entered the shop.

They have a small selection of kilts and Batman belt buckles, some band tees and a small selection of jewellery, but Liberation are all about latching on to widely accepted humour. That's why there's a huge amount of Spiderpig merchandise, some old throwbacks to The Dark Knight and some slogan t shirts aimed at irate teenagers. My aunt would call it moronic, I would call it a bit tacky, but some teenagers and students will be all about it.A decent dive bar
Was overcharged for my drinks
The best time is lateHanny's is a mixed experience for me.  The decor is proper and fashionable.  The aura is [very] modern delicatessen, gone bar.  For these things, I am appreciative.  The food is tasty and well delivered.  The drinks are where the points get docked.

As expected, one should have known better than to order a WWII cocktail.  I actually ordered it, and then when he asked "what is that", I told him I changed my mind.  Refusal to deliver a different (see: more common) drink, I accepted his offer in attempting to make it.  I spelled out the details: dash or two of Angostura, gin and a chilled cocktail glass.  No ice.  Why is he shaking this?  Why is it in a Collins glass?  Weird.  My pink gin was actually an orange gin - oh well.  Better luck next time.

I've since switched to a martini.  

-- "A martini, please."
- "What kind of vodka?"
--"What?  A *martini*."
-"Yea, what kind of vodka...?"
*head shakes*

No vermouth, so...straight gin?  Okay.  Whatever.  I'll let it slide.

A friend orders me a pink gin and gives the directions of how to make it.  This is unbeknownst to me, as I am conversing with another patron.  I move back to our table to find an orange colored drink, on the rocks, in an old fashioned glass.  

---"So, I don't think this is how you make a pink gin either."

Additionally, said friend asks "you have Aviation gin, right?".  "I don't know", the employee responds.  He explains that it is a rhetorical question, as he saw the bottle.  He asks for a gin & tonic made with Aviation gin.  A few minutes later he is delivered a neon green glass of what seems to be nuclear waste.  Come to find out: Hanny's has a drink called "the Aviation" or "the Aviator", and that employee simply ignored the whole conversation about Aviation gin, et al.

The music here can be excellent or awful.  DJ's in training should be limited to their deck time.

+2 for the food.  +0 for the drinks & delivery.I ordered the Matter Paneer and Naan from Straight2YourDoor.com (excellent, speedy, pricey service).  The Matter Paneer had average flavor and spice, but it was lacking in substance.  I had a hard time locating the cheese pieces, and I think that is rather unacceptable for such a high margin dish ($11.99 for peas, curry and cheese).  The naan was tender, but a little flavorless and dry.  Final assessment, average to good, and I won't be rushing to order take out from Flavor of India anytime soon.  I think they could do better.This place has great food, but they have ruined the atmosphere.  There used to be a beautiful fish tank in the middle of the restaurant.  Now it is just a wide open bar that has no ambiance.  Too noisy for conversation.Pizza was very good. i had the 9-11 wings and they were incredibly flavorful. we got a free funnel cakes because of a check in offer they had with yelp so that was cool. they hadnt renewed their liqour license so there was no alchohol available. after we left my wife told me she had found a hair on her slice of pizza. unfortunate. ill prob be back to try the hotwing challenge. def 4 star worthy if it wasnt for the hair.Been here three times now...Love the food...tried 9 different items on the menu and have not been disappointed. Best corned beef and cabbage I've ever had at a restaurant. The service could be better...two times now there has only been one waitress, so drink refills are slow. The place does have an odor...smells like stale cider beer...going to be back very soon to try their breakfast. Hopefully the service will improve soon...seen several interviews for servers going on when I've been in there.Let's start with the positives:

1. Service-- Excellent! My drink was refilled, and my dirty plates were cleared off instantly.
2. Clean restaurant, and nicely decorated. 
3. *****BONUS**** - 2 flat screen televisions were on during dinner-showing the NBA finals.
4. Sushi roll was good (my wife and I go with the cucumber rolls w/ avocado). This is a good option for those who really don't like seafood all that much.

Negatives:

1. The salad which is part of the 2-item dinner special had way too much dressing on it. 
2. The bulgoki beef was disappointing. The flavor was ok, but the beef itself was a little soggy and fatty.

From my experience, there are better sushi places in the area. I love Sushi, and Momo sushi come to mind.I walked far and wide for this place. After hearing so much good things, I had to see it for myself. 

I would have given this place 2 stars because the fruits I ordered were NOT fresh, and I couldn't finish them because they were kinda nasty. Also, the wouldn't give me milk for my double shot espresso because then they would have to charge me as a cappuccino. C'mon.... it's just milk.

But, my friend ordered the most delicious looking plate in the world (chicken parmesan). The plate was definitely large enough to share 2 or 3 people! Also, server was very kind and conversational... even during the busy hours of the Cafe. I will return the next time I go to give this place a fair shot.This place is average at best! How can so many people give it 4 stars? The chicken I had here was overly seasoned.I finally stopped by this place after driving past in numerous times. I ordered a steak   burrito. It cost about $6.00. It wasn't to bad, I feel like though it needed some salt. I don't know if they forgot to put it on but it was kind of plain. Had it had a more flavor I would of given it 4 stars. I will try it again though as the prices are pretty fair.So,  we decided to try out the new steak salad wraps.  While we did not realize that the steak was going to be cold and the steak had a lot of fat on it and it was not cut up too.  

Hopefully next time when we go back to Paradise Bakery we will try something better.  Normally everything here is great.  

Also the customer service was great and the Cafe was really clean.Best homemade corned beef hash I've tasted in Phoenix! =)

Visited this place as we were in the area and had groupon for it. Hubbie and I shared, as we always try to do, a special on that day that includes homemade corned beef, whole wheat pancakes, eggs, sausage and hash brown. Pretty good serving for us and we came out full. The best part of the combo was the corned beef, very tasty! If I come back, I will definitely have corned beef again! =) It was pretty busy at 930ish, service was fast and good. Since we have a groupon for this, we only paid the tax and tip which was a good deal! 

Nice breakfast place tucked in this complex where you can quietly meet with friends and families for a nice breakfast. Will absolutely try this place again! =)Heard this place was pretty rad, and so seeing for myself, it was pretty grand. The space was huge both inside and outside. On a Monday night, it was so crowded inside at the bars and dance floor that it was almost impossible to dance, unfortunately. Go Go dancers, multiple bars, and a lot of drunk people and mayhem. Not really sure if I was into the overly crowded crowd, as nice as the club looked.Only had breakfast. Food was good but probably not worth the price. Decor is fabulously whimisical. Service very good. It's pretty close to the pool and it was a nice place to have a nice meal while still in swimwear (and a coverup of course!)The only good thing about here is that the servers were nice, attentive, and friendly, other than that, the proportions of food compared to the price is not worth it. Ordered a $10 pork chop, and the size of the meat is only half the size of what Tuscany Casino offers(which is only $9 dollars). Their fried rice was good, but their other Asian entree are full of batter, that when I ordered Salt & Pepper Sea Bass, I can barely taste fish. I would only go back here for the fried rice.Great service and above average pub food.  They suffer from problems with consistency in their food from shift to shift and restaurant to restaurant.  A real genuine chef created the menu and recipes but I fear this place is missing some of the pub food basics we have come to expect.  I wish Chef Joey would sit down and simplify the choices at all of Golden Gaming places.  In the meantime... better than average.  I recommend the Cheese Steak WITH WIZ!!  Very close to the Philly original.Another Old Town, history laden pub on the Royal Mile - High Street. This is quite a famous pub and many tourists can be found here. 

On first impressions the  interior is a tad untidy. Posters on the walls and doors, prullaria on the tables.  The bar area is small, but well stocked. you have little nooks where you can sit around beer barrels or rickety tables. I guess this is all part of the "Ye Auld Toon" experience so many tourists crave after.  They serve real ales, cloudy ciders and the obvious whisky references are plentiful. 

I did not try the food, but many plates past me by and the punters seem to enjoy it very much. - I could detect many languages and cultures which really added to the atmosphere but to get one thing very clear:  This. Is. A. Tourist. Pub.

To me it is difficult to class this as a local. OK the prices are similar to other pubs, but the ambiance, feel and impression all seem to scream TOURIST at you. 

Easy bar to meet up with people or even show off to visiting friend and family, but not for a nice evening of beer, nuts and banter.Over the past few months, we have been on a search for the best red velvet cupcake (or something similar to a cupcake) in town. Sadly, we did not find it at Nothing Bundt Cakes. Don't get me wrong; It was okay, but it didn't even come close to the quality and taste that we experienced with Tammie Coe's red velvet cupcake. I think we got spoiled by having her cupcake first, because all of the other variations have failed to impress us as much, if at all. There were two major problems with the bundt that we tried here: First, it was too heavy. Maybe that's just the nature of the bundt itself, but we found it to be way too heavy and rich, which only allowed us to eat about half of the thing. Two: It didn't have a lot of flavor. I know that might sound contradictory to my last statement about it being rich, but just because something is rich and heavy doesn't automatically mean that it has a lot of flavor, which this dessert clearly didn't have. It was missing that "wow" factor, that melt in your mouth so good you want another one, type of feeling that we get with TC cupcakes. I'm glad we tried it once so that we can scratch it off our list of places to try, but I really doubt that we will be going back for any more bundt's. Oh well, on to the next place! 

P.S. Any suggestions for a place to try red velvet cupcakes (or bundt's)are welcome!If you just want a quick bite to eat then this is perfect spot. They are not open late so get there before 7:00pmI have been here twice now - once solo and once with my husband.  Both times it was after lunch for a sweet pick-me-up. On both occasions, the place was empty of other customers inside. Not sure if it was due to the time of day or the fact that it was a weekday? The one employee inside greeted me and let me browse the yogurt selection. They have a large selection of frozen yogurts to choose from (10 or so?) and then there is an even larger selection of toppings. They have seasonal yogurt flavors and the month I went it was coconut. I am a big coconut fan and immediately went for this. I then topped it with dark chocolate chips. I'm a big dark chocolate fan so this was a plus in my book. (So many places only have milk chocolate! Yuck.) I really enjoyed my frozen yogurt. The employee asked if I had a frequent user card and I signed up for one. If you forget it, they can look you up by last name or cell phone, so you don't always have to carry it with you.  Overall, this is a nice fro-yo shop tucked in the AJ's shopping center.Not a bad place if you like craft beers. I came in to start another mini tour. I always love the food especially the pizza. The service is usually good, however today it sucked. We were seated at the bar 10 minutes before we were greeted by the bartender.  Not a full bar either. The food we ordered was out in a reasonable time and was delicious. My only issue today was with the bartender and the service we got. If I go there again and see her tending I will go to the restaurant part.The food was good but a little on the sweet side compared to other Thai restaurants I've had.  Nice staff though.  There's slim-pickin's in the far west valley for Asian foods so I can't really compare to others in the area.  Compared to others I've had around the country, three stars is about right.The positive: rooms are nice, bathroom huge, great tub and separate shower. Refrigerator in the room, also a microwave and little kitchenette (not that we would ever use it). 
The reasons we will never stay here again: the gated entrance is nice but a complete pain when you just want to pull up to the hotel instead of wait for gates and bars to open. 
There is only valet parking. It's nice to leave your car at the front door but there is no option for self park. That means you have to wait to get your car back. We were in tower 1 and valet doesn't open until 7am.  I know that is early for some people but for us it's almost late. We had to walk to tower 2 to have our car brought up. Yes, we tried calling for it the day before but that was too hard for them to figure out. 
All this car stuff is irrelevant if you can't stand the wait for traffic to actually move to be able drive into the hotel. We've been coming off Koval to Harmon and the traffic is insane. 
Walking to the Strip can be done thru the MGM - but get ready to walk and walk and walk. Your best bet is to walk up Harmon toward Planet Hollywood and City Center. 
The music from the pool seems to end around 6p, so you will have to provide your own entertainment after that. 
It's a lovely hotel but really, we will never stay here again. I'd rather pay a little more for the conveniences we want in a property on the Strip.I've been here twice now and I just can't say that I love it or would highly recommend it.

I've had both breakfast burritos and prefer the Costa (spicy chorizo).  Ask for the jalapeno cream cheese, that stuff is awesome.  Usually I overdue it and gorge on a breakfast burrito, but I didn't want to finish my meal both times I went.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, it's just not great.

The food was cooked well enough and tasted fresh, though the rosemary potatoes were cold and not very good both times I went.  Highly recommend the Cafe Caramel Coffee, incredible.  

Short of that, everything else lacked the wow factor or really great overall flavor.  They seemed to play it safe across the menu.  Even the pancakes were a little bland.

On a side note, they make their waitresses wear wife beaters, which I thought was pretty original/cool.Well to be fair, Im between 3 and 4 stars. I like the place, it has nice atmosphere and I will be back. I like that you order at the counter, wait is very reasonable, and patio area in nice and not crammed. 

Food is alright, but nothing exceptional or way better than at any other place. Having said that, $23 for breakfast and coffee for 2 is a bit too much for me. I had eggs, they were ok and that's it. Next time I'll try something that got all the positive reviews and see if my a-ok feeling will get up.I like the prices for Nutro, which can be anywhere from $10 - $15 cheaper than a normal pet store. I also buy my dog's bones there, as I like the selection they have out and the prices are also, in most cases, cheaper than the pet stores. Anything else, however, is a bit on the pricey side and wouldn't recommend buying leashes, beds etc from there.

The customer service is okay, but most of the time they're not trying to help me, they're trying to get done whatever task they were assigned and ignored me until i placed the bones I bought on the counter and grunted to get the 30 LB bag on the counter for them to scan. Even then, it took a while for them to get to the register. At the end of the transaction, even though there were no other customers, the woman at the register didn't offer to help me carry the bag of food out to my car.

I'll still go to the store and buy their food, but I'm hoping their customer service improves.This goes for all PB's not just this particular location.  Shame on you! I used to love this place and it was #1.  I loved you 10x more than Wildflower.  Guess what? Wildflower surpassed you in quality now.  

You are trying to save money and thought we wouldn't notice you are giving us less and charging us more and complicated the salad menu.  But not only are you saving money by giving us less... the product itself just isn't the same.  After years of going there, I have no intention to go back.  It just isn't good anymore and I don't like being tricked.  In these times, you're getting more for your money at restaurants.  Why is Paradise Bakery doing the opposite?I have been to Turf twice now.. 

Once for breakfast .. I got your typical English breakfast, cant say it was the best ive ever had, or memorable for that matter, but it was alright. My bloody Mary was good, but I swear the second one only had half a shot of vodka in it.. and if im wrong I am sorry, but I could only taste Mary mix. As my friend put it, the bartender was a "charisma vacuum".. and yes, I didn't catch his name, but he wasn't cool at all. They had various sports teams playing on all the TV's, which is great if youre into that. 

Second time I came I was with a group of extremely inebriated people.. and I FELL ASLEEP at the bar. I did not get kicked out, so 2 cool points for that.. I still cannot believe myself and how I got away with that I do not know. Either way, I remember a lot of weird shit going on, and everyone I saw, for the most part, was laughing. 

I have nothing bad to say about Turf, but I also have nothing to rave about. If you're hungry or want a drink and are in this neighborhood, try it out for yourself, and try to stay awake. Its a little embarrassing when you don't.We walked around and chilled at one of the bar/lounge. The hotel is one of the newer ones and is very contemporary. There are a bunch of interesting designs. P.S. Parking is a tad confusing.Ok so my first real Las Vegas experience....super excited!  What I like about this hotel that it was really clean, our room were really nice, and was very chill since there wasnt a casino in the hotel, and the staff were very accomdating. My biggest grip was that it was not easy access to the strip!  Everytime we went somewhere we had to cab it.  I wouldnt object staying here again but this wouldnt be my first choice!Good food.  My burger was a hair past medium when I ordered medium rare, but still tasty.  I ordered the mushroom swiss, which was a little light on mushrooms.  My girlfriend had a bacon cheeseburger which she was very pleased with.  Massive sides of delicious tots and fries.  Overall I'd come here again, but probably only get 1 potato side for me and the gf to share.  And as others have mentioned, the hostess was a bit of a coot.I was jonesing for chicken tikka masala. 
After resisting the temptation to be the loser eating at an indian buffet alone I decided to try this new place I'd been hearing about. 
After fighting downtown traffic and parking, I walk up to the touch screen and discover NO TIKKA MASALA. Super lame. Apparently the menu changes daily...I begrudgingly order the butter chicken and some naan. 
I was pleasantly surprised! I was expecting a generic Pei Wei experience but aside from the naan being a little rubbery and oily it was actually quite tasty. 
I really wish this place wasn't in the black hole that is the Arizona Center, er..."Copper Square". Whatever. By the looks of how dead it is at lunchtime I don't know how good the survival rate is but I'm excited to go back and try some of the other items!I'm giving it three stars because the Jambalaya and the Gumbo were great.  I ordered the fried seafood platter and the catfish was completely dryed out,  the oysters were ok, the fried shrmip were very good and the boiled shrmip was flavorless without the cocktail sauce. Honestly, if I didn't have a Groupon for this meal, I would've been very unhappy to pay for this dish. 
The hushpuppies were served with the bread and were not hot which was very strange.
The saving grace was the wonderful gumbo and jambalaya. I would go back for those 2 items only.Big Earls Greasy Eats says it all!  It's most definitely a greasy (and super size the greasy part) spoon dinner converted from an old gas station from back in the day.  We've passed this place so many times on our way to eat at other restaurants in Cave Creek and keep saying we are going to stop, but never do until now.  

As always, I pull up the Yelp reviews prior to going anywhere anymore and found this place had several mixed reviews.  So I called on a few local long time residents that are good friends and also got mixed reviews from them as well.  I also looked them up on the "Best of the Valley" ratings and saw they were listed as one of the best in the entire Valley.  And so begins our new culinary adventure as a family on a Sunday afternoon.

Big Earls is a greasy spoon that is clean and has a fun ambiance for very casual dinning.  This is an old gas station converted into a dinner.  They offer limited seating inside so we dined outside with lots of room to move around.  The weather was awesome which made our experience more delightful.  

The service was very good, friendly and welcoming.  The food was average at best.  We had the Blue burger with fries, the Big Earl Classic with fries.  Our burgers were served on a potato role that was supposed to be grilled and was not.  The meat on both burgers were cooked very well done, which we did not order them that way.  Our fries were also very plain and average as well unfortunately.  

We had such high hopes for Big Earls Greasy Eats based on our first impression of walking past the old gas pumps (very cool!) and into the dinner where we were greeted and served by a very friendly person (fantastic service).  But the food did not live up to the hype from some the other Yelp reviewers nor the "Best of the Valley" ratings.  Since this was our first visit I will not give them a 2 star rating but rather a 3 star rating based on their service and ambiance.  I also plan to revisit Big Earls soon to give them another chance just in case the cook was just having a bad day.Pretty fountains... water movement to music.

Looks delightful and sounds nice.

It is FREE entertainment in Vegas!I like P.F. Chang's. I really do, however, there were a couple things that turned me off to this experience at Planet Hollywood. First off, I asked them to go light on the pepper flakes on my Kung Pao, since I am a baby when it comes to heat. And of course, it was loaded with pepper flakes. However, it didn't really  matter in the long run because our waitress's breath smelled like a dumpster and she kept breathing on me. Pop a mint, honey! I totally lost my appetite because her ass mouth and avoided conversation with her like the plague. Also, she was slower than cold tar, it took forever to get each course.I don't quite share the same contempt for this place as the rest of the reviewers, but it's definitely not my favourite Edinburgh pub.  It's meant to be the Edinburgh medics' pub, yet they never seem to be in there.  The drinks are just to expensive for it to make itself a valid option for a 'real' pre-drink.  £3.50 a pint is nowhere near student prices!!
They probably don't need the student custom, however, as it's always full of the local middle classes enjoying a post-work drink.  Apparantly their food is pretty good but, again, pretty expesnive for what it is.
It has a nice environment, although you're always pushed to find a seat.  Have a look and see what you think.The Atlanta Yelp Empress, Kathleen M, came to town this week to help out with the Yelp Rocks event, so since she's a fan of ethnic cuisine, I decided we'd try Tandoori Times.  

It is kind of hidden in the shopping center - I suggest they get some better signage.  But we're smart girls, and we found it... it looked pretty dead from the outside but once we were led to a table, we saw a few other parties dining (including some friends of mine on a date!).

While our service was attentive enough, our waiter kept attempting to talk us out of what we wanted to order and tried to sell us something different.  For example, when we ordered the chicken tikka masala, he suggested we order chicken chile instead.  No thanks!  And when we ordered the bengun bhartha (eggplant dish), he suggested something else too.  We stuck to our guns though.  We were girls that knew what we wanted!

In addition to the dishes above, we shared a house salad, rice, and a tandoori roti (whole wheat bread made in the tandoor oven).  We would've ordered an appetizer of sorts (Ie: samosas) but you have to do that during certain times of the day and we missed our window for that.  (Kind of odd, huh?!)  Nonetheless, I enjoyed everything although I added a lot of hot sauce - it didn't have much kick without it.  Gotta love that hot sauce!

I really enjoy Indian food and don't eat it as often as I'd like.  It seems that many people are not up for adventurous eating... I don't get it!  Regardless, I'd come back to Tandoori Times in a heartbeat.  It didn't knock my socks off but it was a pleasant experience with attentive service, decent ambiance, and moderate prices.  Thanks to Kathleen M for trying something new with me!For the price and the convenience, I would say this is a pretty good place! I got the garlic knots that smelled slightly better than they tasted (they were a little more bland than I expected, but otherwise good) and had a little more oil than necessary and a small Godfather clock pizza (which was all good, except the olives were a little off). I appreciated that the pizza came with a free side of ranch and all this together was just a little over $11 with tax.

They have slice specials in-store, too, that look to be a pretty good deal. 

Mostly, nothing too terribly special to write home about. I wouldn't drive out of my way to go here, but I definitely would choose it over some of the other options in the area, especially now that Papa John's has decided that a few cents per pizza is too much to pay for health insurance for his employees.  I'm much happier supporting local anyway.I have to say that I was expecting more since their other location is one of my favorite spots.  

I am a frequent lounger at the Postino on Campbell and I figured this location would be just as great when I decided to meet a group of  girlfriends here for drinks a few weeks ago.  We sat down at a lovely little couch/chair area and waited for our server.  We waited...and waited...and waited some more.  It took forever for them to realize we were sitting there, greet us and take our drink order.  Once I got my wine and was a little more pacified we decided to tackle the topic of what bruschetta would we be ordering this visit.  Well, we had plenty of time to decide and debate because we waited forever for our server to come back.  I would understand this much better if they were busy, but they weren't.  

I am a big fan of Postino, so I will chalk this up to a fluke.  But, next time I hope that I don't have to wait an eternity for my glass of wine and wonderfully delicious bruschetta...it's rather cruel to leave me hanging when I know what awaits my taste buds.We stayed here the second weekend of November 2010 for two nights. The stay, would have been a very pleasant one if not overshadowed by the initial terrible experience. Upon arrival, exactly at 3am Saturday morning, we were told by the staff that their system closes nightly right at 3am and remains closed for 20 minutes and due to this fact, they would be unable to check us in for the next 20 minutes!!

Imagine us, dead tired, after 6 hours of driving from Los Angeles, had to wait in the bar area alongside our luggage for their system to open up again! We almost passed out on the couches when after 20-25 minutes we were called and let known that we could check in! The tragedy was that this seemed pretty normal to the staff.

I have stayed in numerous hotels all around the world and have checked in at different times of day and night, but definitely didn't expect this from a presumably high-end hotel. I can't say anything bad about the hotel itself or the service, but I believe they should be required to make this fact known to their guests before their arrival so they can plan accordingly.Pretty solid Mexican restaurant.  They offer the full assortment of menu offerings that we've come to expect from all of the Michoacan restaurants around town.  The food is good, but falls short of recipes at the other restaurants.  It's like there's just a little something missing, and the prices are anywhere from $2-6 higher per dish.  

Be patient.  The facility is a fairly small and during dinner time there is often a wait to be seated.  

The one area that they really conquer and rule the competition is their Sunday brunch.  None of the other Mexican joints can hang with their brunch.  It's a full buffet bar with freshly made dishes, soup, salad, and desserts.  Their tortilla soup is to die for; they offer fresh ingredients, that include ingredients such as avocado and creme fraiche to fix the soup up yourself.  Sunday brunch is $14, which includes the food and drinks.Delightful little restaurant with amazing service and pretty fantastic French fries. I'd give a higher rating but I only ordered a blt. I'll have to try again.I have been shopping Savers for years.  I always bring my Mom and Sister to Savers when they come visit from out of state.  We have been known to spend 3-4 hours since we have to go down each aisle.  I love books especially children's books.  The selection is awesome.  I was having a Olivia the Pig birthday party for my daughter and we found 10 softcovered Olivia books for .69 cents each with buy 4 and get one free.  So, I had some party favors the kids would really enjoy.  You never know what you are going to find.  I have gotten some really nice name brand clothes for my daughter.  Also, there is a really great selection of purses too.  I like how everything is organized and color coded where you can get some extra savings depending on the color.  Also, 20% off on Wednesday for senior citizens too.  It is worth checking out.I've been there twice now. First time was just for the frozen hot chocolate. I was expecting more when I tasted it. It was good, but I don't see what was so special about it. I went again recently and decided to try the Deep Fried Oreos. DAMN, this is one of the best desserts i've ever had. The Oreos were covered in a perfect batter, and the oreo's inside were warm and soft. This combo mixed with the cold oreo ice cream is a perfect match. I'd go to this place just for the deep fried oreos.good for the desert, but not a big fan of the food. the portions are huge thoAfter nearly making Vegas my second home, I've decided to give the famous Serendipity a try ..

Came here on a Saturday night around 11 pm and the wait was 35-45 minutes. However, the part that puzzled me was half of the tables were empty. We waited some more to get water and we waited a little bit more to order. After that, we waited much more longer for our food. Was it worth all the wait? Ehhhh, not really. The crab cake salad was good, but the shrimp pesto pasta was lacking.

Maybe I could be wrong, maybe they're just famous for their dessert, maybe their food isn't all that in a hat, but after waiting for so long,  we didn't even have room in our stomach for dessert.i was in an abnormal mood for pulled pork so hit this place up to try and satisfy my annoying craving. 

Staff was very nice, Cool pictures and two tv's as well. Not a place to really hang out for hours on end or anything. beer selection is very minimal as well. We ordered a lot of food. pulled pork sandwich, a sampler and also the hotlink with mustard appetizer. baled potato salad, mac n cheese cornbread etc.

Everything was good. Don't really have any complaints. I have not ventured to many BBQ places in the area so i cant really compare, so for now they get an A-OK until i venture off and have someone to compare them too..It's a decent facility and is open for the most part 24 hours in living up to the name. I think they only close for half the day on Thanksgiving or some such. Staff is friendly and helpful, a big plus in my book. Only trainer I worked with is Zach but I would recommend him to anyone. Plenty of parking once you learn there is more parking on the east side of the building. Plus it's next door to a sporting goods store so if you need a new pair of swim goggles or exercise gear, you've got a full size retail outlet without even getting back in the car. 

This location only gets three stars though because of its drawbacks. It is beyond overcrowded at peak times (forget about using dumbbells after work). Broken equipment has gone unrepaired for 5+ weeks. The elliptical trainers are poorly maintained. Most importantly, the AC is insufficient for an exercise facility. I sweat my brain out exercising here and if it's going to be that hot I may as well be outside getting some vitamin D in my system. 

As a gym, it's better than most, but in terms of value for money, it could be better. Recommended for those who work or live nearby, and those who prefer to work out at odd hours.I was a little skeptical about drive-thru espresso, but Dutch Bros is a decent option if you don't want to drag yourself elsewhere. The bean is a little overroasted, but their specialty drinks are sweet enough that you don't really notice. I have to admit that they are incredibly friendly no matter how many cars they have queued. They certainly manage to move drinks and people along in a speedy fashion. Convenient and tolerable.Ate here last week and forgot to write a review. 

I went on a Wednesday during prime lunch hour so the place was busy but no wait. 

I went with 2 coworkers and we were quickly sat at a table. The waiter was friendly and gave his opinions on what we should get. Two of us got pizza and one of us got a burger. 

The "Pepperoni" pizza was great, it had two types of meat, jalapenos and had a great crisp to it. The pizza I got looked more like a salad then a pizza but after i removed the 12 pounds of arugula from the top I found my pizza and it was delicious. 

The burger looked very good, but I didn't try any of it. He did comment that the bun was amazing and felt like it was baked fresh. He mentioned it was one of his top burgers in his mind. 

So overall the food quality was top class. Why the 3 stars? The value for price. 


So the pizza you get is about the same size as Pizzeria Bianco and runs about 14$ per pizza. That is a little high if you ask me. I mean the pizza is good, but not godlike. I can get same quality from NYPD or Mama Mia pizza for half the price, or twice as much for about the same price. 

I cant rate the burger value as I didn't taste it, but I think he said he would have it again. 

Anyway, I'm not telling people to stay away from this place as the food was very good....just know that you will pay for it through the nose.Made the mistake of going there 2 days before Christmas... There was a lot of staff which is good! But there was just too many people inside...More of the same.  Coffee is decent, Wi-Fi is limited during peak hours, and the place is jammed packed most of the day.  This city needs more Wildflower.Jumped in here to see one of the shows on at the fringe and enjoyed a relaxed drink beforehand with no hassles.

Reasonably priced with a decent food menu I regrettably didn't have the time to try out. It included champ! You don't get that everywhere.

Huge outdoor seating section which is nice, poorly lit inside with a few bars and a labyrinth of different little 'venue' type places inside I suspect get used for clubbing?

A nice enough place in a dingy part of the city centre where you can park yer bum comfortably.This is a Pakastani restaurant not an Indian one. While there is overlap between the two cuisines, it's not the same. Pakastani food involves more grilled items and is less spicy. It's food involves less sauce, cream and heat (chile).The food was good but it tastes like really well made home cooked food as opposed to restaurant quality food. In some ways it was better in that it was less greasy and tasted fresh. In other ways it was worse because the execution on the vegetarian dishes was quite poor.

My biggest peeve was that many items were not available on the menu. Many of those items were basic. like Malai Kofta, Dahl Makhani, Shahi paneer and Paneer masala. In other words, the most notable Indian dishes on the menu were not available which confirms my observations above. Not one Dahl  was available that night. The owner claimed those dishes required too much prep time and since they make things fresh, those items were not available. Funny because every other Indian restaurant makes those dishes daily and they taste fine to me. I think the real reason is he didn't have a lot of cream and they were understaffed in the kitched and couldn't prepare those dishes on the spot.  

That being said, I do recommend this restaurant if you primarily go to Indian restaurants to eat Tandoori and grilled items. Indus Village seems to specialize in those dishes and I wouldn't be suprised if those dishes are some of the best in Phoenix. They really take pride in their grilled items. However this is not a vegan or vegetarian place. Yes, they have "vegan" mentioned somewhere on the menu but that is a joke. Eating vegetarian at a Pakastani restaurant is like asking for high fiber foods at a BBQ restaurant.Sean McClain comes to Las Vegas as possibly the best non "celebrity" chef to ever lace up an apron via Chicago.

Our anniversary dictated I move a little bit up the food chain from my usual favorite, casual restaurant haunts and this seemed like just the big ticket.

So obviously we had higher than usual expectations.  All in all we had a good experience.  The room was really cool.  Tables spaced far apart to afford us a little intimacy.  Big, cool murals lit with blacklight.  High ceilings.  Very cool.  Service was fantastic.

Food was just okay.  Very American comfort foody menu.  Root vegetables and jus' all over the place.  The squash soup was not great.  Too thick and underseasoned.  The rest of the food was just okay for the pricetag.  Some came out cold and presentations were more bistro than fine dining.  It was fine, but I won't likely be back when there are so many other 150/person restaurants out there I haven't checked yet.  Plus there's only so many anniversaries when the sky's the limit.some of the reviews on this place are frightening, but our experience was fine.  Huevos Rancheros were enjoyed by the wife, I liked my chicken and waffles even if they were chicken fingers.ATMOSPHERE:   3-4 Stars- Very open with west view. We were lucky to get a "u" shaped booth for cozy relaxed dining.
SERVICE: 4 Stars- very attentive waiter.  We also had two other employees "check in on us".
FOOD: 3 Stars- Chicken tortilla soup- Yummy, just right spice level and nice and thick with beans,corn and yes- real chicken!  Greek salad (we shared one order and the waiter served it already separated into 2 bowls--very nice touch) fresh veggies with just right amount of dressing.  We both had a big serving so the actual salad must be HUGE.
Reuben sandwich:  good balance of kraut,meat, and cheese on swirled rye.  (Shared & good for two).  Bloody Mary- standard fair.  Espresso same.  Sweet endings with carrot cake- above average treat.
Total bill-$75.00  3 Stars - this seems to be the "price-point" for a two person 'standard meal' on the strip.
Yes, I would go back- but with so many choices-probably not.   Too many restaurants to try here in this great city!This place is just okay.

Good: 1.convenient if you're staying at the Aria.
           2. Food is ok.

Bad: 1. Long wait to get a table.
         2. Long wait to just get water.
         3. Long wait to get food.
         4. Expensive for what you get (hash browns that were room temp..probably made a bunch ahead..., meh coffee, just unimpressive all around).

I would go here if I were staying at Aria again & didn't want to leave hotel to eat.. Last resort.Food was just alright. Nothing special. Service was ok. King crab legs were frozen. Carving station chef needed attitude adjustment. Overall probably wouldn't be back for how much they charge.I think a review of 3 for a ok is about right.    The prime rib was pretty good vs other places I've tried.  I didn't try their other carved meats like their chicken, brisket, ham etc however they all looked delicious.  The mac and cheese and other sides were amazing.

Reason i only give it a 3 is because for a buffet to get anything higher i think the food should not taste like "buffet" food.   Especially when your dropping 40 to 50 bucks including tax and tip.   Some buffets do this.   Aria doesn't.   I think for less money you could go to any of the lower end hotels and still get the same buffet and same food.  Aside from the carved meat station and the seafood (crab legs and peeled shrimp) everything else wasn't even good it was average at best.   Mexican food stale.  Asian food stale and horrible.   The rest were standard things like fried chicken breasts potato wedges etc.

If your gonna come here go straight to the carved meats (rotisserie chicken, prime rib, brisket, etc).  Otherwise if your looking for the same quality but save some money go to planet hollywood or anywhere else its cheaper.

I still think rio buffet was one if the best I've had.Located inside Aria Hotel, next to the Bacarat area.  Not sure why they call themselves a Thai restaurant when, like most Asian restaurants in the various casinos in Vegas, they serve dishes of all diffrent Asian cuisines.  Nevertheless, I was a fan of Lemongrass -- probably one of the few good things I have to say about Aria. 

The food was yummy and authentic. I particularly liked the sesame chicken, extra spicy and the beef chow fun.  The tom yum soup was also really good. 

Service was horrible -- really, really slow despite not being all that busy. Decor was nice.  There are definitely better Asian restaurants in Vegas.One of the most over priced Italian restaurants I've experienced. The portions were miniscule while the prices were stratospheric. The quality was so-so. My raviolis were so dry they were hard to swallow. The gingerbread desert was unremarkable for $11. Pasta dishes were in the $20-30. Better make sure there is a McDonald's in the area to hit after this dinner!!!!Pasta w basil was decent. Good panna cotta.Went for the first time today. Iced latte doesn't compel me to return. Menu seems cutesy, more like a Dairy Queen than an urban cafe.I was waiting for the rest of my family to arrive at the Riviera and decided to get a small meal to tie me over. Since I'm a huge fan of Philly Cheesesteaks, I decided to grab one. 

The cheesesteak was pretty decent. It had good bread, nice pepper and onion flavor, and the meat was on par. 

The entire meal plus a coke was under $9, which I think is comparable to other fast food places. 

Since I'm in Las Vegas, I will not be eating here again. There are just too many other places to check out before I leave. However, if you're in the mood for a quick cheesesteak, then swing by and pick one up.Ok Ok Ok from a blank observational distance one would expect a place where you can get steak, eggs, and hash browns for 7 bucks to be quite a steal, but its all about relativity in the city of sin. Better and cheaper exists, better and cheaper always exists in vegas ie: go next door to Bills. I came here with a party of seven the place was half full at best, and it took them forever to seat us. The hostess was doing paper work, what the heck?! why do you have to fill out an application for us to sit down? 

pros: 1. It's cheap 
2. open late 
3. the wait is shorter than other places 

cons: 1. cheaper places exist
2. they fill out paperwork before you sit, is this the dmv? 
3. quality doesn't stand out 

meh, if its 4 in the morning and you and your friends don't feel like waiting at Bills, I would come hereI was disappointed with the food this time. The spicy yellowtail roll was too spicy. They over did it with the siracha sauce and spicy mayo. I didn't eat much of it and none of the servers or sushi chefs noticed. The rice on the nigiri tasted not so good. It was hard and maybe undercooked. I also had a tuna specialty roll and though the portion was large but the rice was ehhh. The service wasn't bad except for not asking if the yellowtail roll was okay. Don't think I will go back though.i was very disappointed in this place. i had driven far out to get here. i live in gilbert. i got the pinkbet, beef mechado and pork adobo. their portions are very measly. they are overpriced and their food wasnt very good or authentic tasting at all. the only thing i liked was the pork adobo.They're pretty good. I used them for everything from oil changes to maintenance on my '07 Ford Escape . It ran good until the day I sold it. I now have a '09 Lancer Ralliart and I only take it there for oil changes. I started going here because of the convenience factor, my family uses them, and I got a discount on my oil changes. I just picked up my car from there and while I like the fact that they have always been kind to me and I can just dump my car and then come back and pick it up whenever...it seems like their oil change price has creeped up :-(.  They were so busy too. I tried calling because they said they would call when my car was ready and 3 hours had passed. So, I tried calling them and got no answer, so we just drove down there because they normally have it done within 30-60 minutes. Sure enough, my car was ready to go. I went inside to pay and the phones were ringing like crazy. She was doing everything she could to keep up . That explains why I didn't get a phone call. I like supporting family owned businesses and would like to keep coming here for oil changes, but I think I will have to re-negotiate my price next time considering I know a place that is a bit further, but throws in a free car wash with the oil change for the same price! Like I said, I only take the Lancer there for oil changes. This car is my baby now and I will only do any other kind of maintenance or repair at the dealership.Le Monde certainly looks the part, with its super fashionable interior and expansive premises that seem to go on forever. If I'm to use the word hotspot, which it looks like I'm going to, that would describe Le Monde pretty well, due to its prime, popular position right on George Street.

The bars are themed into cities, with Milan, Vienna and Paris rooms making up the main bar. Le Monde has been immaculately designed in every way, so it would be hard not to be impressed by the modern and uber stylish interiors. This is a very good looking place to sit and have a drink, but it's probably just a bit too pristine for me, as I like somewhere I can slouch about a bit more, and I find that the heavy weekend crowds can make the important task of obtaining a drink quite tricky.My husband, my sister and I ate there at lunch today.  They had chimichangas and both enjoyed them.  I, who LOVE enchiladas and almost always order them at a Mexican restaurant, ordered a combination of enchiladas and tacos.  The tacos were OK but the enchiladas were lousy!  The sauce was very boring - too much tomato, not enough pepper and the enchiladas were not cooked thoroughly.  They were edible but wouldn't order them again.  Service was friendly and atmosphere was nice.  However, with all the other choices for Mexican food in the area, I don't plan to return.Super-cheap soft serve, slushies, and various other treats. As the name implies, it's carnival food. 

Small, but discarded seats from Tilt-A-Whirl-like rides outside for your seating pleasure. We just got our ice cream & chilly willys (ice cream + slush puppies) to go and ate it on the walk back to my friend's home a few blocks away.3.5 stars.... maybe 4

Forget about any of the other fast food Mexican food joints.  The "Ricos", "Bertos"...  Taco Bell... etc. 

This place produces really good fast food/ Mexican food. The beans are great!  The rice isn't bad and the burritos are huge!  

We've eaten there twice and the first time around everything was a hit. No issues with the food or the service.  The second time around... the food was still pretty good. The grilled chicken nachos were pretty greasy. the chicken... although flavorful was fatty and this set the tone for the rest of the meal.  Wasn't horrible.. just could have been better. 

 Do drop in and give this place a try. It isn't expensive... and you better bring an appetite....as mentioned... the portions are huge. 

We will go back.
HatchSo I have a shout out for this particular Borders. More than a month ago (Oct 7 to be exact), my husband had gone to buy about 8 (not kidding) guide books for our European holiday. Out of these 8 he bought 4 for Italy. Since these books are rather large and we were only going to be holidaying in Italy for less than a week, he ended up bringing 2 and so we have the other 2 to return. Come Nov 10 I go to Borders after my Barre class (Yay to Barre!) to return these books. Although their return policy clearly says no returns after 30 days, the guy at the counter was nice enough to get manager approval and processed my return seamlessly.

So why am I giving it 3 stars again?...Service is good, selection is not bad, store is clean BUT....there were teenage kids running all over the place. The store employees told them not to run but I still saw them still doing it all over the place. How can one get the bookstore experience in a bookstore that resembles a high school cafeteria?

On a separate note, service here is really good and the location really can't be beat.Great little place tucked into the food court of the Orleans. The pizza was full of flavor and very filling. I've never seen a Sbarro outside of a food court somewhere and don't even know if they exist, but would love to see what they could do on a grander scale. They have definitely become my food court "go to." Good italian restaurant quality food with food court convenience.Enjoyed the Bento Box experience - a selection of 6 items off the menu - which include varied Asian options..... Japanese, Indian, Mandarin, East/West, etc.   It was fun, but more than confusing by the time you received your meal.  You pretty much forgot what you had ordered and, for me, I don't like eating something when I'm not sure what I'm putting in my mouth.   Sometimes there are shells you should be aware of and added flavors or accompaniments you might not want to eat.   Overall, the food was good, but not as "wow" as I expected.   However, it was very convenient for us, as we were staying at the Mandarin Oriental.  It could also have a better view.A basic lunch spot. 

So the GF and I are walking around Friday afternoon, thinking of where to eat lunch. A girl in one of the entry way of Palazzo was handing out a 25% off card for Lagasse's Stadium, so we said why not. 

You can seat in a conventional booth or in the stadium lounge section, we opt for the latter. Area was spacious. Kind of different and neat, you sit in front of their huge sportsbook tv's. The place was empty, so we had plenty of room to spread out and kick back. 

I had the chicken avocado wrap with fries. Decent for lunch, nothing fancy but nothing terrible. Now thinking about it, chicken a little bland and dry. The GF had the BLT with fries. Nice size sandwich with a nice pile of thick-cut bacon. We both liked it. We also both had Bloody Mary's to start our day, something nice and salty before shooting craps. 

Service was decent. She and the water boy was there when we needed them and then gave us our space. With the discount, it was a modest bill for Vegas. 

So...this place is not awful but nothing great. Just a practical place to have a lunch. Depending on you, 2 or 3 Yelp stars. With the coupon card, you can stop by. Without the discount, you're not missing anything.Make sure you have reservations before you go..food, service, seating are fine if you have access to them.24 hrs drive thru.Taco shell was crispy and tasty, but chicken inside wasn't. Although the chicken was tender.  Tamale was a la carte, with enchilada sauce and cheese, no husk, served in a long Styrofoam container, placed in the bag and given through the window sideways so the sauce basically coated the whole bottom of the paper bag. the mais of it was good, and so was the sauce, but the meat inside was only a very small amount. you get what you paid for.  The guy at the window was polite and was easy to talk to.I wanted to try Revo Burrito because I am such a fan of Delux Burger (Same Owners). I'm not sure if it was because my expectations where so high because of Delux, but I was let down with my meal. 

Nothing really memorable about my burrito, the only thing I remember was the rice on the side (Should have just got a rice burrito). The lemonade is a big part of their concept, but it was way too sweet and very sour. 

I want to try this place again. Maybe I will try the fish tacos that people like on the reviews.No CAKE POPS!  No chocolate chai mix!  Won't take my Starbucks card.  But at least it's close to the room elevators...First off... I come to sushi places for the Veggie rolls and appetizers. I don't do any of the rolls with fish... 

I had the veggie roll & the cucumber roll. My friend and I shared the gyoza which were great. My rolls were as expected.. and in my book that was good. My only complaint and its minor.. but I asked for the avacado to be swapped out with cream cheese.. she said there would be an extra charge for this....?? I decided to keep the avacado..  anyway, my friend had the california rolls and was pleased enough with them. 

So, for a small quaint little place.. It was good.Stopped in a whim because I'm new to Phoenix area (from Ohio) and had never seen a Savers. Basically it's a thrift store like a Goodwill. Fairly large, organized & relatively clean. I didn't really shop, more just walked through to see what kind of items the carry. Lots of clothes. Home goods & knock-knacks. They even had a preacher's pulpit in the furniture section! Crazy right? Prices seemed ok, but not huge bargains overall. But maybe that's just a difference between Ohio thrift stores & Arizona thrift stores?We've been looking for a good Chinese buffet since moving to the Phoenix area about two years ago. So far, this was our best try. Still, wasn't impressed. 
When we walked in the door, nobody greeted us. We stood there looking like lost kids for a while, searching for a "seat yourself" sign or directions on what to do. Finally, someone told us they'd be with us in a minute. Ok.  By the way, the place was almost empty.  
Got a table, and ordered beverages. When I went up to get food, much if it had definitely been sitting there for a while. There was little left in many bins, and what was left was lukewarm and well..tasted like it looked. A bit stale and dry. That said, I did like the green beans. I never try sea food at Chinese buffets, so I can't tell you how that was. Didn't look great. 
I didn't get much with my first run through, so I went up a second time. Some items had finally been replaced or at least refreshed with fresh food. Maybe we were there on an off day. I don't know. I have yet to find a really good place. 
Extra review : we had a little one with us. The high chairs were disgusting.You know, for the location, ambiance, price, and service, they really set you up to expect top notch food.

I went here for lunch and had the Pork Loin lunch special.  I opted for the "asian cole slaw", over the bonfyre mashed potatoes.  The cole slaw was super delish!  but, it was the side-dish

The pork loin consisted of four small strips of pork.  It was moderately tender, moist but, a bit over cooked.  The portion was just ridiculously small.  I do appreciate American portions are over-sized and you get smaller portions for lunch and at good restaurants but, this was just cheap.

It was served on a bed of slimy, overcooked greens that were so salty, they tasted like they were cooked in brine.  The black bean marmalade/salsa was good but, it was literally a couple of spoon fulls.This review is actually for my visits to the Horizon Ridge/Horizon Drive location, I couldn't find a Yelp listing for it.

PTs has been serving the Vegas Valley since 1982. This hometown bar/restaurant has been consistently popular ever since, and tons of properties have popped up all across the area. 

First and foremost, I have to say I am surprised at the atmosphere of this place. It is quite elaborately decorated, plus there are TVs all over the wall so that you can watch newscasts and sporting events alike. Perhaps the best thing about this place is that they have a huge, enclosing glass wall, complete with door, separating the restaurant from the bar area. That is an ingenious idea, and I wish more restaurants would follow their example. 

The menu is larger and more diverse than you would expect. The place carries tons of dishes, including a number of monthly "special" items. I have tried numerous entrees here, and don't really recall ever eating something I didn't like. The Mardi Gras Chicken Breast is to die for, and the Zookie (a fresh-baked cookie piled up with ice cream and chocolate syrup) is simply amazing.

However, I was VERY disappointed to see that the place doesn't carry shakes. Given their ice cream-based desert items, I don't see how much harder it would be to make these. 

If such great food items and good, separated atmosphere, then why only a 3-star rating? Two main reasons:

1) Even when the place is practically dead, the table tops are always dirty. It's pretty sad when I have to come in with my family to eat and choose the "least dirty" booth to sit in. 

2) The service is VERY SLOW. There are friendly employees here who recognize us when we visit, and I appreciate that. But they just aren't around enough - don't know if this is a staffing issue or what. When my dad asks me to go to the bar to get him another beer because the server is taking too long, that's the first sign that the service is too slow.

PT's has good food and a better atmosphere than you would expect. I only wish the service and restaurant cleanliness were up to snuff. If you want a quick dining experience with decent food, though, you've come to the right place.

UPDATE: My opinion of this place has gone down severely for two reasons:

1) They have taken all soup off their menu. You've got to be kidding. I get sick and tired of seeing places do this, and now PTs can be added to that list.

2) Happy hour ends at 7. We got there at least 5 minutes before 7, and the server didn't get to us until after 7 because they are all incompetent and slow. And they REFUSED TO HONOR HAPPY HOUR, even though WE WERE THERE ON TIME. The server said some BS about the computer changing after 7. If that's the problem, just ring up every other drink! It isn't rocket science!So we haven't been to a hooters in probably 5+ years.  

Apparently you are some sort of zoo animal if you aren't familiar with the inner workings of their menu.  

We ordered wings and nachos.  The girl asked us if we wanted the wings breaded or not....ummmm, I don't remember there being choices.  I just remember thinking hooters had pretty decent wings.  Now what?!? We asked the server her opinion...she said, "I thought you said you had been here before."  Then, she recommended the naked/unbreaded variety.  We decided to wise up and try both.  We ordered them medium and she warned us that their medium was very mild, so we ordered them hot.  

Oh my! That was difficult.  

Well, we concluded that the breaded version is far superior to the naked version and the "hot" is indeed not spicy so I'm sure the medium is ultra mild.  Whoa! Did you follow all that? Should wings be this complicated?  Their wings are almost covered in a buttery sauce....very different than other buffalo wings.  They were A-OK but not one of my top picks for wings.  The nachos were MEH.  

This location is nice because they have a big indoor/outdoor patio.  We ended up spending around $30 for 2 sodas, wings and nachos.  A bit steep.Picked up take out for pajama night at home!  

My husband was very dissapointed with the hot and sour soup.  Claims it was the worst he's had.

We also ordered string bean beef, chinese eggplant with tofu, combination chow mein, and a free BBQ sliced pork for spending $20.  The eggplant was the winner.  Huge portion and really good.  The string bean beef was tasty too, a bit salty.  The chow mein was ok.  Certainly not the best I've had.

Good thing the BBQ pork was free, it was awful. Flavorless, chewy, yuk.

It'll do the trick for chinese take out, it's not the best but it's cheap, hot, quick, and filling.This is fast easy food. There's no real glamor to it. Usually there's a short line, but service is quick. You can get as much sauce as you want. I recommend getting a giant pinks hotdog cup with a cocktail. 

Blueberry jello shots are pretty gross...especially if you're pounding three. DO NOT RECOMMEND.

It's a hot dog...it's decent. The location is convenient and for that 3 stars.Walked in, got greeted. Ask for a booth for more privacy for our little ones, host went to look for a booth..no booth found & got stuck  with the table right behind the trophies & in between two big parties. As we were getting seated  I immediately saw an open  booth available that the host couldn't find!! Asked to be moved. Changed table, ordered drinks..to only get watered down iced teas..MY FAV!!! Ordered food..all food came out @ a reasonable time, except for one, an order that wasn't brought out with the rest because jokingly the server didn't have enough hands to bring it out, & then to only find out that the food hasn't even been started to be made!!!YAYYYY!!

-First time here & Im already turned off by the place.
-3 stars for the food though.
Bbq chips -eh 
Kids loved the ribs
Brisket - ok
Sweet water catfish - okOK, still some cool stuff -- but the place has changed hands. Check it out, though. Clothes are better organized.First visit

Located behind the Coco's and KFC in this shopping plaza, this small place is decorated for functionality not high fashion.

I got a seasoned beef fry bread "taco", a plain fry bread, some vegetable beef stew, and a honey/powdered sugar dessert fry bread.

All very, very good. The beef seasoning was quite mild, so next time I'll get the red chili beef. Luckily they served some chilled chili sauce with it :-). The stew was really flavorful, although the carrots weren't quite cooked. The dessert was sweet, but not slathered in honey or coated in sugar.

Two things kept this at a three rating: 1) a bit pricey for some of the portions - the stew was maybe a cup, and 2) the fry bread was very, very greasy.

I will definitely give them another try.The food was gr8. I'd give it 5 stars if only I had seen the server more often. The venue has a beautiful view n layout. I had no reservation n I got sat down immediately. Besides the sticky menu, the food came out promptly n was delicious. 

What really bothers me is that,  I wish we could tip the busser NOT the server. The bus boy gave us gr8 service, more attention n packed our leftovers. That's my only gripe. 

Please tip the busser cash. I'm a regular n I feel for themI typically come here at midnight for the graveyard specials. It's not the usual steak & eggs, but wings and fries. Although I am truly saddened by the fact that it used to be Dan Marinos and they used to have 25 cent wings.. At least the wings still taste great but I must say the service just gets more whack every time. 

Oh and i suggest never to park in their parking structure. If you cant find parking outside then the best spot is to park at tropicana nearest to hooters. yeahh theres a little secret passage way through the bushes.

Also, recently I've discovered that their steak speacial isn't so bad either.I came here after midnight for the $.25 wings (must sign up for a player's card). For $.25, these wings rock! 

Try the barbeque, which is the best flavor to me. The regular wings are good too, just really buttery (but I like butter).

The 911 is toooooo tangy and salty!Stuck inside the Mirage we were staying, BB's was a nice surprise.  I love blues, I love BB King, and I love food.  How could this go wrong?

After receiving much deserved Bloody Mary ($10, but they have bottomless for $20), I look at the menu...

Chorizo burrito, sounds good.  Corned beef hash...i love that stuff. Biscuits n Gravy..too heavy for a plane ride home...

What's this?  Chicken and Waffles? Jackpot.

Served with hot sauce and syrup.  It was spicy and delicious.  Not enough waffle for me, but I am glad I ate it none the less.  Gladys Knight sells the Midnight Train in Atlanta, which is chicken and waffles.  Hers looks to be better, but I will take what I can get.  3 chicken tenders, a good size waffle, covered in butter, powdered sugar and syrup.  Don't forget the hot sauce. $15

Wife got the regular breakfast.  eggs, meat, hash brown, biscuit.  Good.  not worth 13 bucks, but in Vegas, you are at a resort, therefore expect resort prices.

Anyone complaining about price in Vegas is probably in the wrong place.

Since we were staying here, we walked by twice at night to hear music in the club.  Both times sounded great.  Wish we had more time to hang out.When we walked in we were told it would be a 15 minute wait...eventhough as we looked around there were atleast 5 tables completely open, cleaned off, ready for people to sit there.

The server was very nice, friendly and answered questions. The food was ok. It wasn't exceptional and it wasn't worth the price. All in all, it was ok and if I had a million dollars to spend and didn't feel like cooking my own spagetti, I'd eat here, otherwise, I'll make the basics as home for much cheeper.The location is most likely perfect for the neighboring "lake" community. I would probably not return due to the distance from my house but was here for a college reunion and found the place to be nice.
The location is a new one, proven by the fact that they have a banner sign hanging instead of a fixed one. Signage in the shopping center it's located could help. I used my iphone navigation to find it. 
I had a Belgian beer, my favorite, Hoegaarden which was great and a merlot. Nothing too special. I took advantage of the free food offered by my college. Apparently one of the samplers I had was alligator meat, and fried. The curry chicken I was served on skewers and quite good with a selection of cheeses as well.  I'm pretty open minded to different foods but it was pretty greasy and well I didn't eat more than one let's put it that way. The decor was nice with barrels serving as the base of glass tables. Perhaps for parents/the young at heart (or staff) and their kids(?), there was a TV and Wii near the bathrooms.
I'm aware that Australia has great wines and the concept and name separates it a bit from the "French" named competitors but I don't think the mainstream public might get it.  Otherwise, a nice neighborhood wine bar, just not a place to have a meal though the appetizers were decent.We had a company dinner here. Although the service was rather slow( took them a while to bring our drinks and refills), the food is quite nice.

My favorites: Potatas Bravas, Ahi Appetizer, pan manchego, mushroom risotto, Rabo de Toro and the amazing Red Sangria

Disappointing:the spinach salad and the absolutely horrible paella. I was looking forward to it, but the flavors were way off and the rice was over cooked. This is one dish that almost no one on our party ate.

I would come back for some drinks and apps, but would skip the paella for sure.I think the only reason I am giving this buffet 3 stars is because their Mongolian style BBQ was pretty awesome and they have my beloved Chinese Donuts!!!  The food selection here is pretty impressive.  If you've ever been in a Hometown/Old Country Buffet, just imagine all of those food troughs covered in Asian food.  I tried a little bit of everything that looked good to me, and that amounted to about 15 different items.  I wasn't too impressed, but I quite enjoyed the honey chicken.  The rest of the food was just really flavorless and the chicken and broccoli left a really gross film in my mouth after I ate it.  Since I wasn't feeling the buffet I went over to the BBQ area.  They have lots of good stuff to choose from, including shrimp!, but I narrowed it down to a few items.  They have the create your own sauce thing, but none of it is labeled, so you have to guess and kind of stab away in the dark. I waited FOREVER to get someone over there to cook my food, but once it was done and i ate it, it was really good.  We won't be back for a few reasons and there are a ton of other Chinese buffets to demolish first.Was pretty cool I guess...until a girl I was with turned lame and tried starting a fight. The club itself was nice but the "buy 1 get 1 free" bottle service turned out to be $550?? And our "host" guy kind of sucked and was definitely not as attentive as promised.  it's inside a beautiful hotel though!this review is based on two weekday visits, seperated by a time of six months. 
first visit, I was practically ignored by the bartender. the crowd was modest, easily could have been covered by one server or tender. my son spilled my modelo, and the bartender noticed the incident, went off to retrieve a washcloth and then never came back. I was sitting about 5 feet from the bar in the large table. I finally had to walk behind the bar and get the damn towel myself. and, she never did bring me another beer, as I requested. 
Plus: the menu for happy hour is limited, but the 3 taco sampler I got was mouthwatering. very very tasty, cooked right and appearance was 4 stars. 

second visit: enjoyed a warm welcome from the manager, seated promptly, again, happy hour menu did not dissapoint. still, the bartending staff here has their heads up their asses. too bad, as well, since they have great variety of real tequilas and decent prices for good mexican beer like Bohemia and Negra Modelo. 

the salsa variety is decent. when the weather is nice (7 months out of the year!) the patio is a great place to enjoy company who has passion for real mexican food OR a great place to bring your visiting friends and family. 
Food, atmosphere, staff 4 stars
Bartending skills, 2 starsIt was ok only. I ordered delivery and they messed up my order. They gave me egg drop, instead of wonton. The rangoon and general chicken were delicous. Other than that it was alright.Very good burgers; great shepherd's pie. But other dishes hit or miss. They try too hard with their salads, and just put too much stuff on them for my taste. I ordered what I thought was going to be a "chicken salad" recently. What I got was a chunk of grilled romaine And and whole, crustily breaded chicken cutlet with some other stuff.....not what I wanted at all, menu could be clearer. But great for big groups, good beer, fun atmosphere. But stick to the burgers!Huge portions, perfect hangover food, but the service was less than attentive. I'd go back bc the food helped clear up my hangover.The original one in San Diego is way better than the one in the quad.   The food wasn't very good at this one especially, the pancake I had and the eggs were over cooked.  Tried something different had the tractor plate thing and I will not have that, again that, is for sure.  This place is dirty compared to other ones and the staff is rude.Having never been here before I didnt know what to expect. When we showed up, knowing we'd be on the list - the greeter said we wasn't and therefore had to pay cover. (Even if we were relatively early out, I must say.) When to the fairly rude girl, the manager showed up and pointed out that we were on the list. I give credit to the manager acting like a manager should. 

Nobody was dancing, nobody was mingling and the place sure wasnt empty. Maybe our entrance made the piano player take a break (the figurative piano player, mind you) because it wasn't exactly hoppin', if you catch my drift, but it has potential. People were drinking though, and still it was no direct line to get to the spotlessly kept bar. Maybe if I would have stayed longer this place could have made a more memorable impression. 

But the place is nice.. the VIP sections are cool off to the side, still within the desired visibility.. I can see that this is a decent option if going to one place and staying there is the plan of the night. The review could've ended here, but I have to mention one thing - the restroom. 

The restroom. 
I stepped into this little piece of David Lynch imagination due to the call of nature, and Holy Crapper, Batman - this was weird. Ok, so the men's room is as big as a normal handicap bathroom but with 3 added urinals. The toilet is still there, of course with no stall walls, door or anything. Still right there in the open, next to the only little sink, and by "next to" I mean literally next to. If this isn't weird enough, add a restroom attendant. So with me and the attendant (like 4 feet behind me) it's already crowded but leaves the philosophical (and optimistical) room for a few more. It's like having a urinal in an elevator. I'd feel less weird at a trucker stop off of Autobahn.Haven't tried everything on the menu yet, but carne asada and pastor were both good.  Best thing on the menu is bean and cheese burrito and their guacamole....I know three stars doesn't sound so great but I really have no complaints about America's Taco Shop. I thought the prices were okay for mini soft tacos at $2.35 a piece, and certainly my order of 2 carne asado tacos and 2 tacos al pastor were filling. I ordered both "America's Way" which meant adding grilled diced jalapenos, and appreciated being able to order online and pick up my takeaway order just 20 minutes later. I guess I wish I'd been able to have other selections from the shop, perhaps dining in the really charming dining room, to really get the full experience. All in all the experience was A-OK.The food was good (a Cobb salad), and the atmosphere was pleasant.  I found the prices a little high ($16 for a salad?  Really?) , but given that Lake Las Vegas is a little piece of the Strip in the middle of nowhere, not unexpected.3 stars cause they get my drink right every time, minus 2 stars cause the Wi-Fi is horribly slow, Burger King across the street is 69% faster... did some calculations to figure that out...The optometrists here are very good at what they do.  The office is very clean and well organized and you rarely have to wait long.  Unfortunately, their selection of eyeglass frames is very limited and the prices are high.  They also try to up sell you with add-ons like scratch resistant coating or light adjusting lenses.

I do recommend this place as long as you have good insurance and are not on a tight budget.Service 5

Food of Asia has been the flavor of the month. I can't seem to get enough of it.... Literally no matter how much I eat I can't seem to get full. Which is exactly why this is not only tasty but in my favor for my current fitness goals. The right dishes let me pack in the good calories on cheat meals but limit
the nasties.

I was ready for some more Thai food but the foodie in me had an itch to try a new place. Stray from the usual's and take a risk? We know Sala and E-San are tasty but sure why not. Food blog and yelp time! Landed here and after drooling over the menu had a mild obsession that had to be taken care of. Called up the usually eating crew and headed out.

From reading the other reviews I was already prepared to walk in the door and go unnoticed for a long period of time before I was seated. Seems someone listens because their door is now equipped with a pleasant chime that let the very busy, nice ladies, know my face was there and needed to be fed. Seems this is no longer a problem.

Very cool place in a very less then cool looking strip mall. My favorite kind of find! The whole place was done in Asian influenced stained wood panels. The obligatory Thai restaurant oversize tables/chairs were also in full effect.

The ladies took great care of us. As usual they got a laugh out of the big white guy order enough food for 10 people at a table of 3. All gone when we got up to leave, that's right! I know there are hungry people somewhere and no one will give me an address to overnight my leftovers.

I would like to give this place more then a 3 but something was flat in the food. I couldn't exactly put my finger on it but it bugged me the whole meal. Maybe it was missing some of the sweet my americanized palate had become accustomed to? I don't think that was it but something was missing from all but one of the dishes.

Duck Pineapple Curry:
House specialty and I can see why. This was the best dish on the table. Something about the coconut and scalding pineapple chunks made for a great combo. Maybe the sweetness from the pineapple in this added what seemed like it was missing in other dishes. The duck was fatty but obviously rendered properly as it wasn't a vat of grease. Duck is often ruined in stews but someone knew what they were doing. Taste, smell, and texturally a happy place.

Panang Curry:
My standby anywhere I go. One bite and although it was decent something was definitely missing. Not all curries are sweet(ie: massaman). I enjoy those as well but this one should have some sweet. It didn't and something else was off. First thought was skimping on the coconut. Disappointed face :/

Drunken Noodle:
Fire! which I loved, but we had some gringos at the table so we specifically ordered it at a 3. If this is a 3 of 5 with a further option of thai hot I cannot fathom what Thai hot is. Whoa.. Now these were decent but someone got WAY carried away with the oil. That coats the mouth and dead goes the taste buds. So by bite 5 all I could taste was burning.

Tom Kha Gai:
A very good version but not my favorite in the valley. Sala and Siam both beat this one according to my taste buds. Nothing unique or different worth nothing. Hit the craving.. no more.. no less.

Thai Toast:
Oh freaking greasy awesome.. I love this stuff no matter how much I know its killing me. From the other reviews I was prepared to have to order a side of peanut sauce and pay for it. Volume wise you get your moneys worth. This was like no other that I had tasted. Much more of a goopey peanut texture and not a lot of flavors going on. Was kind of bland. What I like to call not worthy calories. What the heck was I even eating? I'm not sure. A few people said it was great so maybe an off night? or a crap we are out, open a can of xyz brand. Bleck.

Fried Banana/Coconut Ice Cream:
Delicious as it is at all the places. Happy mini sugar coma :D I love coconut ANYTHING!


All this being said with all the other great Thai choices in the valley I will unlikely find myself back here. But it was a great little fling.. don't tell the others!The Tap House is a great place to grab a beer with friends. It has a good vibe, the servers are friendly, there are pool tables, a juke box and Kareoke. 

The food at the Tap House is average. It is mostly typical bar fare. Much of the menu is fried and it tastes like fried food you can get anywhere. The rest of the menu offerings leave much to be desired.

Supposedly, they have specials that are pretty good, including the Monte Cristo. People I went with usually went crazy over it.Pretty decent food for Mexican fast food. new cheaper than dirt menu is enticing. Decent location & the employees are courteous. Keep on keeping on Del TacoThey are routinely overwhelmed with patients and never have enough help, but such is how Sonora Quest works the hell out of their people and makes them "efficient" I am sure.  Status quo here is best described as "hurry up and wait".    

Meanwhile the drain every last drop of blood from their customers.  See what I did just there?The employees are courteous, the location is super clean, but the food selection sucks and there are only three pumps for cars and light trucks who need diesel.Made a pit stop here to grab a quick bite after exploring Caesars palace. The staff was really friendly and let my friend bring here giant margarita from down the strip in. The service here was great our waitress was really friendly and attentive. However, what I found unfortunate was with my food. I ordered the nachos but, since I'm a vegetarian I asked for it without the chili. What I ended up getting was a big plate of chips with only a little bit of cheese. This meant that after eating the few chips that had cheese on them it was basically just a plate of plain chips (no pico or anything) for the full price. It was quite a disappointment."So what are we going to do? Sit around bars, sipping Cosmos and sleeping with strangers when we're eighty?" -- Sex and the City (TV Series)

So for this, I'm reviewing the casino and not the hotel accommodations since I didn't stay here. 

Not too bad, but not my favorite on the strip. It seems so upscale when you walk in (upstairs from the strip and you come down an escalator to the casino). The ceiling is draped in jewels and the place is decorated in vintage photos and giant shoes that you can climb into and have someone snap a pic of you.  Once you hit the casino though, it seems dark and sort of cramped.

I will say, the coolest feature is these old time cigarette machines everywhere.  However, they are stocked with cigarette sized boxes with limited edition art pieces. Random pieces made by artists I've never heard of, but so very creative to retask old machines into something new.

The machines were all slots everywhere. They did have an Organic Roulette machine, but the drink gals were slow and seemed less than happy to serve the 8 people playing on it. Very disappointing. After some time we decided that there were better casinos and off we went / plus the drinks were stronger elsewhere.

The bathrooms were huge, and spotless. Always a plus.Had the card for nearly a year and hadn't had any issue. My balance has been 0 for some time now. Recently someone got ahold of my CC number and some fraudulent charges were made on the card. This was my first interaction with customer service.
The complaint I have with the card is as far as when fraudulent charges are made, they send the claim to the "fraud department" to investigate. However, they can not give you the number to contact fraud department to speak about your case with them directly. They say they don't have access to the department. That seems very strange and fishy to me. It doesn't really put you at ease when in the midst of fraudulent charges are on your card that you can't speak with the department trying to sort the situation out. They also have a time frame ranging from 90 days as to how long your investigation can take.
Thankfully, the department did find that my charges were not made by me in about 2-3 weeks and my card has already been credited.Friendly, same as almost every other starbucks in the country! Nothing amazing, nothing bad. Its near my Vegas home, thats why I go!My husband had coupons for Boardhouse, which is fairly new and near our house, so we decided to give them a shot for lunch on Saturday. The coupon we had was for two shortboard specials for $9.99. Shortboard specials consist of a sandwich (turkey, ham, tuna or roast beef), side and drink and are usually $6.29 if I remember the menu correctly. 

I decided to go with the tuna sandwich and my husband had the turkey. He was offered his choice of mustard, yellow or brown. Otherwise the sandwiches were pretty basic... meat on bread with lettuce, tomato and onion. There were other sandwiches on the menu that looked far more creative and tasty, with toppings like sunflower seeds, mango chutney and cream cheese but alas, they were not eligible for the shortboard combo. 

I did like the sub roll our sandwiches were served on. My husband would have preferred wheat bread... Which may have been an option, we didn't ask, nor were were offered bread choices. 

We both got potato salad for our side, it was fresh and tasty. They use red potatoes and leave the skins on, which can be a turn off for some people but we didn't mind at all. 

Overall I wasn't super impressed, but on the way out we saw a sign that said on Sundays sandwiches are buy one get one free. So I will be back to try one of the more creative sandwiches on the menu on a Sunday in the future. 

They also had chocolate covered bananas on the menu, didn't try them but I was tempted!Not my favorite store to shop. Pharmacy was open late and I had a sick daughter. They were out of the antibiotic and wouldn't be ready for 2 days. I explained that wouldn't work and young girl named Vanessa was not the most pleasant to deal with. Other staff was very helpful calling other stores to see who had it in stock.Never enough cashiers, inconsistent coupon policy, sad veggies, poor aisle labelling, and high prices. The ONLY reason I come here is because of the BOGO meat department on Thursdays. I have gotten some great deals.It's not the friendliest staff that works here at night. I went in once and was really impressed with the building and the remodel they did, but the two girls working that night ignored me for the most part. What really pissed me off was the girl who made my drink walked away before ringing it up to get someone else to ring it up for me. No problem I understand she is probably logged into the cashier, but she sure as hell took her sweet time finishing stocking the fridge before she helped me.This place is solid. Nice decor/feel, except it was a bit empty during weekday happy hour after work, and the bathroom has that terrible fake gold paint that seems like it was slapped up in the dark. 

The food was solid. I had some sushi that wasn't the freshest but I guess I'd give it another try. My fiance had the thai pepper beef. The flavors on his were excellent, even the rice itself was tasty and well-cooked, but the beef was a bit thin and overcooked.

Overall, I may go back because I work in the area, but perhaps should try a time when they are a bit busier and the food might be fresher.Food was pretty good. I been to señor taco a several times. I had the fish tacos and shrimp quesadilla (my favorite) and some rolled tacos. The only thing I didn't like about this place is that there is a looooong wait. If you don't mind waiting then there's nothing wrong. 
Great food....long wait.Love the concept but not completely sold on the food.  There were a couple of good things and a couple not so good.

Roasted Rosemary Cheese appetizer - yummy!  It's roasted brie with salt and rosemary on top served with a side of this yummy strawberrry topping.  A bit salty at first but that's easily fixed by scraping the salt off the top.  What really made it good was the side of strawberry topping to go with.  Did I mention how good it was yet?
Turkey burger - dry and not too flavorful.   The texture of the meat seemed dif from all the turkey burgers I've had before so not sure if it that was a factor.
Onion rings - tempura battered.  Eh.  The onions inside were still crunchy so not soft and fried long enough.  The batter was both soggy on some pieces and crunchy on others.  Not the freshest oil was used but it was a Sunday night so there weren't a lot of people so maybe that's why?
Roasted Vegetable side - they change from day to day. Today was sugar snap peas.  That was very good as well.  Coal grilled which brought out the sweetness of the peas.  Well done.

Overall the service was good.The sushi at Stingray is good, you get great quality food with a good quantity.  For my boyfriend and I we walked out STUFFED with a bill less than $35.  The service was just ok, they forgot one of the items that we ordered but it wasn't much of a big deal, but the mini "tude" from the waitress was more annoying than anything.  Other than that, I'm sure we'll be going back.Had brunch here a few weeks ago with my wife. As usual we split our meals. 

I ordered a breakfast burrito with avocado, green chiles, and bacon. It came with two sides; I chose a sesame bagel with veggie cream cheese and sliced tomatoes. It was all good but forgettable. The breakfast burrito was kind of small but was about the right size considering it came with two sides. 

My wife got the Challah French toast stuffed with bananas. It was quite good and was some of the best French toast I have had recently. Overall we enjoyed our meal, but I am not sure we will be back as there are better places in town.If your looking for bar food, that is what you will get. Average price, average food.Pleasant spot for a margarita-filled lunch or dinner. 3.5 stars

Highlights:
- Margaritas: I loved the fruity grand canyon one (lime, prickly pear, etc.) and the hub got an adult version of a milkshake canister with his 2-limit margarita (got 4 glasses out of that thing!)
- Outside/inside seating: outside was nice on a patio especially at night overlooking some blue lit up trees and misters for the heat, but inside was a nice A/C haven for the height of the sunny day.
- Chips: combo of sweet wontony, yellow corn, orange spiced, and blue corn as well as sweet potato chips. It's rare to find such variety.
- Salsa: great roasted flavor
- Pork: carnitas was a large portion of meat--quite juicy and tasty
- Menu: pure mex and southwestern mex as well as pastas and salads
- Dessert: creative presentation with white chocolate pecans enveloped in a tamale wrapper. Complementary item which was a nice touch.
- Staff: super duper friendly which I appreciated

Lowlights:
- Crabcake: too dense cornmealy for me--couldn't taste much flavor or crab
- Fish: didn't taste too fresh and advertised that veggies would be in the mix, but only limited slivers to were found.

Decent spot. I'd come again for chips and margaritas.I went for the 2 dishes they had highlighted on their menu: Slam dunk shrimp and the Rojo Diablo. Slam dunk shrimp was really good and worth a try. I don't recommend the Rojo Diablo. 

Nothing special about this sandwich. The fried chicken reminded me of a chicken patty and it was a little on the tough side. The chicken breast of also very thin which made the bun overwhelming. I had to ditch the bun at the end so I could actually taste the chicken. 

I'm sure their other dishes are better, and I would recommend they change this highlighted item to something else.Location was clean. Service was fast. Staff was friendly, and at unholy hour of 5:30 A.M, I think that deserves special recognition.  Got big, filling breakfast with coffee for $10+tip.  I have had more spectacular breakfasts but this was good, tasty, filling, and an improvement over last time I ate at this same location quite some years ago.  I'm fairly sure there are no hand-picked-by-the-chef truffles personally-massaged-with-organic-certified-prepubescent extremely virginal olive oil or the like on the premises, but see above: tasty, filling, clean, fast & friendly, $10, and an improvement from last, long-ago visit.  It's may not be "destination-dining", but I'd hop in again.Great :
Salad + Dressing (in sqeeze bottle on table)

Good:
Lime Ade
Bread + Rice
Service

Bad:
Chicken Kabobs (really dry)Went on a Saturday night.  Can't say too much good about the place or anything bad about the place. Happy Hour really isn't a happy hour it's only a dollar off cocktail and draft. I ordered a burger my lady ordered the fajitas they were both okay. The workers were nice as well. The quality of food and drink you can get at a local chili restaurant for half the price. I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody or down the idea of going back if a group of friends wanted to go.. It was the ultimate so so experience4 Stars for the ambiance 2 stars for the food & 3 stars for the service.
Fun place to go, lots of seating & lots of rock-n-roll stuff but the food, ugh!8am, Sunday July 4th, AZ heat is rolling in already.  You will own the zoo to yourself if you go with all these factors , but if you want to claim seeing any large animals during summer, you might want to try your luck at the 7am opening.  We walked directly twds the tiger enclosure per the ticket window employee's suggestion, but they already were in hiding.

We were debating bringing bikes... in hindsight, it's sooo warm and early, there were no crowds, I would recommend your bikes so you can move quickly (or return quickly back later) to see if you can catch an animal sighting before they hide away to snooze when it gets too warm.Most of the place is closed right now. I was told it was remodeling but I am not sure.  What is there is good but there is not much to see right now at the cultural center.This place is a real dive-y dive. It's dim, has a small patio, interesting clientele (lol Browns fans), and yeah, it smells funny. Not that I could dwell on it for long when I was pouring white chocolate ale down the hatch. 'Twas heavenly! The selection of alcohol is actually pretty sparse, but the bartender knew what she was doing, so it's a-ok.

And then after you're hammered, there's the gay Denny's across the street. Best people watching ever.This would have gotten 4.5 stars, had our service actually been decent. 

So my mom and I ate here last night. We were there for about 10 minutes before our server came to take our drink orders.  For dinner I ordered vegas roll, korean spicy beef and mom ordered the pork and shrimp noodles. 

Dinner arrived and the server apologized that the sushi wasn't ready yet. About 20 minutes later after we had finished eating, and never got drink refills, didn't even get checked on we just kinda sat there at the table watching our server go to ever table except ours. Bringing every other table sushi except ours. Then I saw him twice go over to the main area and chit chat with his coworkers. Then he finally comes back over and just kinda stands there with a smile on his face and I said um I think I'll skip the sushi now. He tries to play it off like he had been asking the cooks for it. Whatev. He forgot. Then he brings us to go boxes and leaves for another 10 minutes. He walks by our table yet again and I had to stop him and ask him for the check. After he brings it to us we wait another damn ten minutes and I had to stop him again and say here can you please take this and I asked him if I could keep the receipt and he asks if he could cash out first. I said yeah sure only if you promise to come back. This time it only took him 2 minutes to come back. 

Other than the horrible service the food was excellent. I only wish I was able to try the sushi.What, a gay sports bar?  Isn't that an oxymoron?  Well, I think that the owners would rather refer to their place as a sports bar that just happens to be gay.  (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)  Aside from the small rainbow flag inside it's not THAT obvious (well except for all the gay guys inside).

But seriously, this is a legit sports bar with about 10 plasma TVs throughout with a variety of sports - with usually the Suns, D-backs, Cards or ASU/UA on the tube.  The walls show pennants and sports signage galore.  The crowd skews just a tad older than BS (upper 20s and 30s, rather than lower 20s), and attracts the gay sports fans.  Service is always good and quick.  

There are a handful of pool tables (my home for a quick game of pool), a few dart boards and one of those new-fangled jukeboxes in the joint.  

But best of all Roscoe's has 2-4-1 drinks on Tuesday (and is easily its busiest night), $1 beers on Saturdays and has the electronic console with the hot and heavy Photohunt!!

I've never had it, but they also serve bar food (nachos, hot wings, etc.).  Cash only on Tuesdays.While I still really like Buffalo, they are getting a little to corporate for me.  They have their own clothing line, and charge way too much for those pieces.  Also the prices of most of the other clothes have gone way up.  A lot of the shirts are over $20, which seems a bit high for pre-worn items.  

They have great and unique jewelry so if you're looking for a fun piece, deff check it out.  If you don't mind spending quite a bit of time searching, you can find some good stuff - though it will take work.It appears that as I get older, I get cheaper.  Such is my reinforced experience with Ajo Al's yesterday.  I stopped in for lunch with my blind friend, who despite having lost his vision years ago can "feel out" good food from eight miles away.  We were seated quickly and I started to peruse the lunch menu, only to be shocked that everything was $9.  Since when in the hell is everything $9 for lunch?  That's a dinner entree price, not a lunch price.  Lunch should be $6 or at most $7.  

After getting over my Scrooge-like reaction at the menu prices, I ordered the pollo con queso (shredded chicken covered with cheese and a spicy baja cream cheese suace).  It was heavenly as I remember it from years ago.  My dining companion chose the mushroom enchilada, which also was quite tasty.  

I still hate the way they serve the salsa here, in tall narrow tumblers.  It's impossible to dip your chips in the salsa container (where is a damn bowl when you need one!) so I had to pour it onto my salad plate and scrape up the salsa from there.  Overall, the salsa is only average.  It needs more kick and this is a big issue for Mexican restaurants in my head.  

You do end up with large portions, but I'd like to see them pare down the portion sizes and the prices accordingly.  Two for lunch cost as much as three for dinner the other night at Juan's on Thomas and 16th Street.  That's not right.  

So, overall Ajo Al's gets a B for food quality but a D for prices.  The salsa helped me arrive at my three-star rating for this place.  With minor changes, this could easily be a four-star place.  Make it so, oh culinary gods!From the name "Asahi" which is a Japanese word, I assumed this place is a Japanese bakery like Arai Pastry in Tempe but not....which is a big disappointment as I was searching for authentic Japanese bakeries. I like Arai Pasty but it's bit far and the selection is limited compared to bakeries in Japan. So I found Asahi Bakery online and so excited to go there as it is quite close to where I live.

They still have a few types of buns similar to Japanese ones incl custard cream buns. I bought a custard cream bun and coconut bun. Coconut bun was quite tasty but custard bun tasted funny like almost stale. It was very soft though. 

They also have some steamed buns, cakes, cookies similar to those I see at the bakery inside of Ranch L Market at COFCO. 

The lady working there was cheerful and friendly and told me what breads they were.

Well, for Japanese bread, I need to go to Arai Pastry or bake at home for the ones Arai Pastry does not have. And for Chinese bread I prefer COFCO. They have really fresh and tasty bread.They have a good happy hour on Sundays. Sushi is pretty good but I didn't like the nachos.We ate there for the first time tonight, and I have mixed feelings.  I was a little trepiditious going in based on the Yelp reviews being all over the place, but we decided to give it a shot anyway.  Well, walking in the door I smelled a somewhat unpleasant odor.  It wasn't fish, which is a good thing, I think it was probably cleaning product.  And it was probably just me as I sometimes have hyperosmia, my wife didn't smell it and thought the place smelled good.

So let's talk food.  My standard sushi order is typically edamame, salmon nigiri, and a Philly roll.  Yes, I know, Philly isn't "real" sushi.  Tough, I like it.  But I can't say that I liked what I got at Moto.  It seemed to me that perhaps the rice was a little dry.  It was after 8pm, maybe they didn't want to cook another batch when they'd be closing in an hour.  Regardless, for me the sushi was a disappointment.  Even the edamame was disappointing, it could have been hotter.  Maybe it was sitting for a bit while waiting for our server, I don't know.  My wife ordered a roll which didn't impress either of us.

Based just on that, I'd probably rate their sushi as average, not terribly impressive, and rate them a 2.  But I'm giving them three stars because of my wife's entree: Vietnamese pork tacos.  I don't know what the seasoning on the meat is, but it was GOOD.  And just based on that, we'll probably be returning to further explore the menu.  And if our future visit meets our expectations, I'll kick up my review to 4 stars.

But next time, we'll be skipping the sushi.I wish I could say this place is a secret guilty pleasure. I don't know what it is that keeps bringing me back, perhaps it's the never-ending menu and the hope that maybe someday I will order something I like. However, that has yet to happen and more often than not I find myself disappointed. 

Or maybe I am just not ordering the right dishes? I've tried the grilled cheese, Pasta Da Vinci, chicken Madeira, Caesar Salad, Cheese pizza, Roasted chicken.....all being mediocre. Sure, they load your plate with enough food to last you an extra three meals, but they're an extra three meals I'm just not really interested in. 

The service is always great, though. Maybe they feel the need to make up for the ridiculously long waits this location often suffers....

I think I am done experimenting.Since my original review, Well Suited has expanded from being a tiny adjunct of My Sister's Closet to taking the entire space previously held by the furniture consignment label of this chain, My Sister's Attic. Now that it's bigger, they carry even more stuff.

Unfortunately, it seems that as consignment shops got more popular during The Great Recession, the people that own My Sister's Closet and Well Suited decided to take advantage by raising the prices on everything in the store. 

While I still can find deals here, I can often go to Last Chance, the Dillard's Outlets, or EBay and find new or practically new clothing for the same price Well Suited is charging for used clothing.

What used to be one of my favorite places to shop and consign clothing has turned into a place where I only stop if I'm in the area and that's too bad.Limited selection, high in store prices, lower Petco.com prices, make for a frustrating experience.  Staff is pleasant but sparse. Also they do not have the same merchandise in store in comparison with their website.   I'm not sure if they are trying to steer customers to their website, but they were successful in one thing; preventing me from buying the kennel I saw on Petco.com that was not in the store.  Also beware of Petco.com dog treats--all made in ChinaUnfortunately, this is my regular grocery store. It's kinda dirty. It's kinda ghetto. But it makes up for this in two ways:

1.) There are always parking spots close to the entrance, even when it's super busy. It's like magic.

2.) BUFFEST GROCERY STORE SECURITY GUARD -EVER-. I have to check myself and make sure I'm not entranced by the muscles before walking into oncoming traffic. Kudos, man. It's like you've got a pair of toddlers clinging to your upper arms.I went to Aunt Chilada's at the recommendation of a friend who used to bartend there. 

When I arrived, I was immediately asked if I was meeting a party here. Nope, it's just me... I was seated and brought a menu along with flour tortilla chips (yum!) and salsa. 

I started with the cheese crisp. This thing was amazing!! It was a cross between a sauceless pizza and an open faced corn quesadilla. So good. In retrospect, I would've finished that and eaten less of everything else.

From there, I ordered the 2 combo plate: Cheese enchilada (how could I go to a place named Aunt Chilada's and not order one...) and chicken taco. The enchilada was good, and the sour cream I ordered with it had an almost whipped texture. I took one bite of the taco, and decided against it. It was a crunchy corn tortilla, the chicken was breaded and fried (crispy chicken in a taco?). 

If I went back, I'd stick to the cheese crisp and a 1 entree plate.

There is also a banquest room, and a large outdoor seating area with a bar and bocci ball court.We stopped by this place for dinner because we were stuck in that part of town with an Entertainment Guide and hunger pangs.  I was a little hesitant at first, because the restaurant is sandwiched in a row of restaurants that either are fast food or appear to be.  Anyways, I am glad that we did not turn away.  I had the falafel platter with grilled veggies and baba ganoush.  The griled veggies were very good as was the falafel (honestly, though I can't really tell a good falafel from a bad falafel unless it is total crap).  The baba ganoush was a little less smoky tasting than I have had at other places, but still good.  We also had the spicy feta fries (fries with feta, bleu cheese dressing and wing sauce), which were good, but would not hold up to the Gaelic Nachos at the BOP.  The waitstaff was very friendly and it was a good experience. I would go back, but I would get the sandwich for about half the price as the entree.  The flaming cheese also looked very good as well.While it is the best newspaper in Phoenix it remains well below average.Summary based on several visits:
--barely ok, generic airport with
--usual crap security
--worse than usual baggage claim
--remote rental carsFor layovers this is a decent airport, but if you're staying in the Phoenix area, well that's a different story.  

I was in town for a family reunion and a 50th wedding anniversary.  I prepaid for a car rental at Budget.  Getting out of the gate and through baggage was easy enough.  But getting to the car rental area was a different story.  All of the rental businesses are located in one building about 3 miles from the airport.

Shuttles run every few minutes but may be packed by the time it gets to your terminal.  I traveled with 10 relatives so we basically took over the entire shuttle.

Coming back to the airport was a big hassle.  Luckily we arrived 2 hours before our flight.  We barely made our gate on time.  The reason for the delay was the ridiculously long line at Security Checkpoint C.  Our wait was intense and you could see frustration on nearly every passenger's face.  30 minutes is a long time to to be stuck in a line.

No one seemed to care about the line though, so I'm assuming that it was business as usual.  If you're staying in the Phoenix area make sure you give yourself at least 30 minutes to get through the security checkpoint.

Or you'll miss your flight...It's an airport.  How do you review an airport?  Do I give them 4 stars? 5?  3?  I don't know, so since I didn't walk out of that airport commenting on it's sheer beauty, I'll give it a 3.  McCarron in Vegas, I'll give a 4.  So there's your comparison.  Honolulu International, I'll give a 3 as well.  

Directional signage: pretty basic and coming from someone who has pretty good sense of direction, I'm not saying "wow, I'm so blown away by this airport's signage that I don't have to use my internal gsp system".  I mean, there are signs, you follow the signs, sometimes you forget to look at the signs, and you get lost.  So, look at the signs and follow them.

Shops/Restaurants: they are there.  It's an airport for Pete's sake.  Eat before or after if you don't want to pay an arm and a leg for airport food.

Our bags came quick, but I'll attribute that to the fact that it was an empty flight, and Southwest may just have really good bag handlers.Breakfast here yesterday.  The waiter, Danny, was new but very nice even though he messed up my order.  I didn't bother to tell him and ate it anyway.  Had a lite waffle for $2.75.  It was the softest, mussiest waffle I have ever had but tasted amazing.  I also got the regular size hashbrowns ($1.60) with sauteed onions (.25) and cheese (.30).  What I had wanted was hashbrowns with onion and mushrooms.   Everything tasted good though and was a decent size.

I will go back because both breakfast and lunch/dinner are served 24 hours a day and the food is downright CHEAP.  A grilled cheese sandwhich is less than $2, ect.  An easy place to take the kids.3.5 stars

Finally got to visit this city of Phoenix, when all the other times we both would only be in the city because of the airport. Our friend took us to Phoenix to grab brunch before our trip back and pretty much drove us around Downtown Phoenix. It pretty much reminds me of Downtown Los Angeles. A few ghetto places and a few nice places. I thought there wouldn't be homeless people, but I guess I was wrong. There's always going to be at least 1% of them here and there. 

There's a few one way streets, so be careful when you're driving. ALSO be careful with drivers, some may look like tourist and will not look at traffic while busy looking at something else. 

Drove passed Downtown Civic Space Park - http://www.yelp.com/biz/downtown-civic-space-park-phoenix

Looked pretty cool. Try coming here at night time, the lit up loop will most likely amaze you like it would with me even when it wasn't even lit in colors :D I just can't wait to check it out the next time I visit!We only had breakfast/ brunch at the Morning Glory, so i can't comment on any other feature of the Farm

- Cute place; looks like a small, family-run farm
- loads of picnic tables (and as we were driving out around 11a, we noticed a long line of cars parked along the gravel) 
- the setting would be great for baby and wedding showers, great for groups 

Food:
I had the Gourmet  Wild Mushroom Omelet with a side of sausage
- Home fries and Biscuit were a 3*
- Omelet was ok, with a too-thick hollandaise sauce; 2.5* at best
- Sausages were awful; really dry and cold
- Coffee was lukewarm; not very tasty

Everyone else's food looked pretty good, including the benedicts and tacos.Definitely convenience for us at Foothills.  We have never been unhappy with the cleanliness of our vehicles.  The window rock chip guys are a bit pushy at times, but okay.

What I wanted to say about our last visit, the two gentlemen providing the finishing touches on our car were fantastic!  They were both very friendly and polite.  Our 5 yr tipped and the gentleman shook his hand while the other gentleman opened the door for our daughter and even bowed to her, making her feel like the princess she is!  For this experience alone, we will be back!After my first trip to the Melting Pot, I was in awe over the experience. We started out with a cheese appetizer (which I wasn't in love with), then went for 2 different appetizers, and then the amazing chocolate dessert. The entrees were delicious, but for the small amount of meat actually served, it is extremely overpriced. But, the atmosphere is actually worth the money. The whole restaurant is quiet, perfect for a night of conversation. 

And, back to the dessert. Melted chocolate fondue with all sorts of yummy treats to dip: fruits, cheesecake, marshmallows, brownies, etc, etc. Mmmmmm! Just the dessert, quiet atmosphere, and the bottle of wine had me sold on the evening. 

But, like all others have said, it is very pricey. It was about $140 for 2 of us; including a bottle of wine, an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert plate.Let me start off by saying that the service was absolutely great. I couldn't have asked for a better bartender or waitress. 

Now that being said - maybe this place isn't so bad if you're into paying an arm and a leg to cook your own food. I came here hungry so it was a bit of a pain to have to wait minutes in-between bites.

The upside to the slow eating process is the great time you get to spend with your date conversing and not rushing through a meal - that's always a great change of pace. Atmosphere was dark and relaxing and seating was very comfortable.It was pretty tasty and the prices were good. We called in our order, walked in and payed. Then waited 20 minutes until I asked where was our food. They handed me a bag that was sitting behind them the whole time so our food was now cold and not as fresh. Service is were they lacked.We just saw Marmalade Skies play here last night.  We showed up early to grab one of the last tables. Fans of the band showed up in full-force. It was SRO early in their set. They sounded great ! 

The service, however, was below par. It seemed as if the place wasn't  prepared for the crowd that the band would bring in, even though the band played there about a month ago! We ended up waiting for the server to check on us more than once while we sat with water & drinks completely drained. If we hadn't been there specifically for the band, it's very likely we would have gone some where else. 

No condiments brought out for the sliders. No small plates brought out with the nachos deluxe which were nothing special. The sides of ranch we ordered didn't arrive either. The fries that came with the Real Deal Philly Rib Eye were soggy. Their Wings are the reason for 3 stars. I had the Honey Hot  wings grilled and they were DELICIOUS!Cine Capri is great, especially for movies like Gravity.  Food and drink choices could be improved, though they're certainly better than Desert Ridge's.  Had issues one time with broken seats and crazy loud volume.  Still usually better than AMC.Took my older brother shooting for the first time here. Having just moved to Arizona finding a good range is on my top to-do list. Caswell is by no means a horrible range. I liked it in fact compaired to other locations I have been. It took me but a second to get everything I needed from the front counter to start my brother off on sending his first rounds downrange. My only complaint is that caswells is a bit on the tight, closed in space list and I felt I did not have adequate room to comfortably situate my self and my brother to shoot. Other than that I cant complain, fun shooting!
- Note if you have kids and want to introduce them to shooting.. look for a different range, with a much greater space to do your thing. This would not be my first pick if that is one of your goals.= = = = = =  CLOSED  = = = = = =

How sad to have lost another Mexican Buffet here in the Valley.  RIP Julio's Too, along with Camarones, El Penasco, two Pancho's (Phoenix & Mesa), as well as Tradiciones a while back.     :-OWent for dinner again.  Had a coupon that I needed to use.  Surprisingly, the dinner service and dinner menu options were better and better prepared.  Maybe different chef for dinner than for lunch?  Anyway, it was pretty good.  I would go again with another coupon, but not if I did not have a coupon.  Pretty pricey since everything is ala carte.The pizza rolls are pretty dern good. The calzone is just ok. We were told the meatballs and breaded chicken is not made fresh which is a disappointment to me. Its good but when going out, Id prefer fresh made ingredients. Its good for a quick and inexpensive dinner. Haven't tried the pizza. Husband has had the baked spagetti which is pretty good.Jason's Deli is perfectly average for a quick lunch.  They have a large menu with sandwiches, wraps, salads, and soups. The food is average quality, but the prices are reasonable. The service is friendly. I recently tried a southwest chick wrap and was underwhelmed. The chicken chunks were too large and dried out. The wrap was overpowered by jalapenos and the sauce was runny.  But I've had the Reuben here and it was pretty good.  I like to stop by Jason's for a quick lunch, but there are many, many better deli's out there.Dropped by Dillards to check out their Swarovski collection & found it to be quite limited. The ladies at the jewelry counter were friendly & recommended checking in the mall next to the food court. They believed their was a Swarovski location there still. As I was making my way thru the store I found an outfit for my little girl. I think the pricing was reasonable & the staff was helpful. Sometimes even a blind squirrel finds a nut.Treated aunt to a belated birthday dinner (three other adults and two children dining; I only had a cocktail and two teensy flakes off of the top of a cheddar biscuit.  BE AWARE that EACH biscuit contains 8 grams of fat, 2.5 grams saturated, and a total of 150 calories.  

They ordered *Berry-Mango daiquiris http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-lobster-chandler-2?select=d3bUfGn-UZ1bEq99wODlTg#d3bUfGn-UZ1bEq99wODlTg and I a *classic mojito. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-lobster-chandler-2?select=iNV2KvaH87Oqi9k_JefLFA#iNV2KvaH87Oqi9k_JefLFA  I heard that the berry-mango was a balanced mixture of fruit flavors, but the alcohol was hardly-detectable.  The alcohol flavor wasn't missed at all, though.  Everyone who had them "ooh"ed and "ahh"ed.  I wished a simple mango version was available, but I'm also glad it wasn't, or else I would never have found out that RL, or more specifically the bartender working that shift, served a TERRIFIC mojito!  My first sip disappointed, but once I swirled everything a few times with the straw, the drink actually turned out to be one of the best mojitos I've ever had!  It's a classic version, made with Bacardi Superior rum, muddled mint, pure cane sugar (don't like ones made with simple syrup-- too sweet), freshly-squeezed lime juice, and club soda.

I would never be able to dine here (aversion to farm-raised fish, intolerance/allergy to whitefish, shellfish allergies, and Blue Bunny ice cream choices contain corn syrup), but I wouldn't mind enjoying a mojito while everyone else dines!  :)

*Berry-mango daiquiri = 350 calories
*Mojito = 190 calories4 stars for the young bear stuffer guy rockin the converse shoes, he tried his best to keep my birthday girl's attention. She just turned 2 (if you read my reviews she is the one that might be autistic or has adhd and is wild nutz) and she was just all over the place.

Now, this is where I have to take off a star... at the check out... my daughter had a build a bear purse that she stuffed with hearts (both the purse and hearts were BAB, I was not buying them). I quickly snatched it without her looking and put it behind my me and on top of a shelf.... obviously so my daughter would not see it and scream. Well Mr. Lazy from behind the counter (not my cashier) starts yelling MAAAAM give it to me and I will put it away...  HERE GIVE THAT TO ME AND I WILL PUT IT BAAAAAACK. My daughter started wondering what he was yelling about and she was looking around. 
The guy was ridiculous, my husband was paying and he even turned around to see what the guy was yelling at.
2x I replied to him that I didn't want her to see it and then I just walked away.

That jackass should know if a mother tries to hide something away from a child that he should not create a scene. All he had to do was put it back after we left.Brak likes BJ's. For a "brew house" kind of joint, the food is WAY above average.  Some of the servers have been here for years and are great.  Others are horrendous - we've had service ranging from outstanding to unacceptable here.  But the food has been consistently good.  Brak likes the chicken parm lunch special.  The marinara sauce has an extra spicy kick that's both unusual and very tasty.  Would have granted 4 stars if not for the spotty service.  But the food has been consistently good, and is a regular spot on our office lunch rotation.I haven't been here in years, and I remember it being better. I had the Yellow Curry and it was a bit too soupy for my taste. Daughter did like the dumplings, and husband enjoyed the Pad Thai. It really was just so-so though. Service was good, but that was only because we were in there with 2 other parties.I am going to start tentatively with a 3 star.... I have used Aardbark a few times. The 1st time they did a great job with our dog & the cut they gave her. I did walk in specifically saying that I wanted the same cut as one of the dogs on their website... they weren't quite sure of it but looked it up & the end result was close. Since then, we have felt the service go down a little... when we walk in they say "same as before?" - we say yes & it has ended up a little different each time. Also the people there seem like we are bothering them when we go back to pick her up. They yell from the back & say "who for?" & we yell back her name. Then they yell "$36 dollars" & then don't get up for a few seconds which are awkward while we stand there with our cash out because BTW they don't take credit cards. After they retrieved her this last time (hence this review), they bring her out & they have chopped off her ear hair. I asked why & one worker yelled to the other one - "why are her ears cut off?"  I heard a voice from behind the wall stating.... ummm ummm - so I tried to save her & ask were they matted? She yelled back "yes they were matted". I thanked them & gave them a not so great tip & walked out. The kicker is that we had brushed her everyday before taking her in because we knew she was a little over due, so I know for a fact that she WASN'T matted and I'm not sure what happened, but honesty would have been the best policy if something went wrong or she misbehaved accidentally. We do want to give them another chance because, to be honest, for the price they do a pretty good job most of the time. So this review is kind of hard for me & I don't want it to be bad but at this time I can't be 100% on board. Please, please, please Aardbark don't let us down!!If you are patient and don't mind waiting for the cashier to make the person in front of you a double macchiato or chai tea before they check you out than you will like Einsteins Bagels and  Coffee.  They have the best coffee and their bagels are pretty darn good as well.I was excited to try this place based on what my friends have told me and what I read on Yelp.  I decided to take the family out to dinner this past Saturday.  We arrived around 5:30PM thinking it would not be that busy and that we would have a short wait, boy was I wrong.  The place was packed and we were told there was a 40-45 minute wait and due to the excitement of wanting to try this place we waited and waited and waited some more.  After 60 minutes of waiting we were finally seated and our waiter was very friendly and took care of our needs.  The food was a small step above Serrano's with the salsa being a little bland for my taste.

I did a little research after eating here and would recommend calling ahead to get your name on the waiting list no matter what time you plan on visiting and ask your waiter for the hotter hot sauce if you don't find the salsa they bring to the table hot enough.

I will probably give this place another shot down the road.I love me a good sandwich and Flancer's delivers!  We shall start with the bread, as it is fantastic.  Good flavor, perfect level of chewiness, and not all hard and crusty.  These guys get the bread right.  I had the shrimp sandwich, because I love the combo of shrimp and avocado.  The shrimp was overseasoned so it stood out, but the flavor profiles fit well together.  In all, a very satisfying lunch experience.

Flancer's missed the fourth star because the shrimp was overseasoned and the sweet potato fries (that cost a dollar extra) were just so-so.Our first steak sandwich from you and it was good but I'm sorry to say its only half the size of a "philly cheesesteak"...maybe raise the price a bit and make it bigger! I had to buy my guy a taco from lulu's after dinner to fill him up....Stayed here a couple weeks ago when I was in town for spring training and I overall thought the hotel was okay. The room was pretty standard but clean. Pool as nice and having a pool bar was a bonus. This is definitely an ideal location if you're looking to avoid the loud "party" crowd that flocks to most of the hotels during spring training. It was a lot quieter than most and older. Despite a few gems, we had some pretty horrible customer service incidents while staying here. Every pool bartender we encountered in the afternoon and evening walked around like they hate life... they could not have been more unfriendly. We had an awful experience at the restaurant too - I would definitely not eat there again...food took for-ev-er. The shuttle guys were very hit or miss too - some were very nice and friendly and others had major attitude... one even told us he doesn't like "dealing with people"... umm, then why are you in the service industry?? Definitely not my first choice for hotel in the area but it was okay.It comes down to this: do you think that paying about $10 for a salad bar (not including drinks) is too much?  If you do, don't go to Sweet Tomatoes.

Since you are still reading this review, you are probably thinking "it had better be a special salad bar".  Well it is.  Sort of.  Here's what you are going to get:

The Salad Bar Itself: this contains a large variety of items but nothing outstanding.  There are a few prepared salads and some specialities like country potato salad.  The big plus here is that you get so many choices that you will be able to build just what you want, so long as what you want is not chicken or hearts of palm, etc., for which they charge extra.

The Soup Bar: this is the high point for Sweet Tomatoes.  You have eight choices, about half of which are vegetarian.  Chicken Noodle has huge pieces of white meat chicken, and there are usually at least a couple of soups that rate an A.

Pasta, Potatoes, Bread: the freshest items are the pastas, which they make in small batches.  There will be two or three, but unless you think that mediocre mac & cheese is worth dying for, these are not worth looking for.  The baked potatoes and sweet potatoes are ok but no more.  They have a few breads, incuding a couple of foccacios which are not bad (I will say no more).

Desserts:  This is what you get -- soft serve ice cream in two flavors and a few desulatory toppings, a couple of dishes of cut fruit, jello, and a half-dozen types of standard muffins.  They also have one warm specialty dessert each day, such as a chocolate lava cake or a fruit cobbler.  This is usually a cut above average -- try it first.  

Sweet Tomatoes is a comfortable place to eat, albeit a bit crowded and noisy -- lots of kids.  It is clean, bright, and in good repair.  It is also busy, especially around 6-7 pm, but they handle it fairly well.  The conclusion -- if you are not put off by paying $10 plus drinks, and you are not primarily a carnivore, there is really nothing MAJOR wrong with Sweet Tomatoes.I must say that the performances I have seen were excellent. Both were musicals. However, I am giving it 3 stars because the theater itself needs renovation and repairs. The steps up to seats in the main theater are loose, and it's only a matter of time before someone will be seriously hurt and sue them, so I hope that they take notice. Also, the top row is too small, and an employee at the theater admitted that when they constructed the seats, they ran out of space for the top row. Yet they still SELL TICKETS for that row, even though it's impossible to get to your seat. We had to change our seats. FYI, every ticket I have bought through GOLDSTAR, will get you the WORST seat in any theater. I guess you get what you pay for.The 1/2 turkey sandwich special was a mess. They did not use Boars Head on the special deal. It was some other form of turkey. The works minus mustard means a wet, sloppy mix of a ton of sub oil and mayonaise slopped on a soft roll with lousy turkey. Had better hopes. I think the bald  guy who made the sandwich was in a rush, but either way I will stick to Italian dishes here and you should too.Ok rolls. Good but not too memorable drinks. Recommend it for the happy hour.It's clean, brightly-lit, and very close to my apartment, but why are the prices generally so much higher?  Maybe it's bec. of all the organic items they offer?  Organic or not, I hardly ever come here anymore, as I'd rather go to Whole Foods on Mayo for my bread and organic foods' fix, and to Fry's on Shea for the stuff my Mom wants.  It's nice to know that there's a grocery nearby, though.As it was mentioned in a previous review, this place IS basically a convenience store with sandwich makers standing by.  So pretty much take a 7/11 or a comparable "kwike mart" that is over crowded with run of the mill convenience products and stick a deli case in it with a modest display of only Boars Head products (as if Boars Head is the end-all/be-all of gourmet deli) put a menu above it with typical selections of sandwiches and salads and there you have Convenient Corner Market.  The prices are in the middle.  The quality of my sandwiches was good but not uniquely good.  If you are planning a visit, I'd suggest calling ahead to avoid waiting longer than one would expect while dodging people just trying to buy some smokes, a tall boy, and a scratcher
+'s:  fresh tasting bread, family owned and operated, somewhat decent selection of beer/wine
-'s:  limited selection, long wait, could be cheaper, just "ok" sandwichesVery busy location, but I never feel like I'm in line very long. There are a few downsides, such as parking. Good luck tryin to find parking during their lunch and dinner rushes! The tables and floors could also be cleaner. There is always food on the ground and crumbs on the tables.Met my friend for lunch and ... It's ok. However, we did get the appetizer of spinach artichoke dip and it was really yummy!  The service was really good and my sandwich was ok. I love that they have bottomless fries. That's always a plus. My 3 stars comes from the price. I think it's ok but I can think of better burger places for the same price or cheaper. I think $9+ for a (frozen) burger is a bit steep.This place is really not too shabby! I almost feel bad only giving 3 stars, but it's nothing to write home about. It's just terribly convenient, given that I work next door.

The staff is friendly. They've got ginormous breakfast croissants. They have spicy ramen noodles which are actually very tasty, and they actually manage to make them a bit spicy! Bundle that all up and add a bow of very decent prices, and I call this place a win. I've been finding myself there a good few times recently. Matter of fact, just yesterday I had both lunch and breakfast over there!I guess you have to try it at least once to say you did.

We had the sweetest lady for our server, so the service was excellent.

The food was your typical cowboy fare...not bad, not great.  

The entertainment was heee-larious.  I felt like I should've worn a ten-gallon hat.

It's tourist-y, for sure :o)Pretty good stuff.  Cheap, no frills, etc.  Good quick bite for lunch, but probably not the place to go if you're trying to impress someone.My wife and I ate here to night with friends. I thought it was good, my wife did not. This is a place where you get a bowl to add all the raw items you want to have cooked on a very large flat stone surface. Then you add sauces for from a large variety to a separate bowl to add to your raw items when cooked. They have suggestions but you don't have to follow this. I created my own and I was sure to dip my finger in my sauce bowl to check the state. Be sure to do this as the sauce needs to be pretty strong because a lot of it will be lost when it is cooked on the flat stone. My wife failed to do this and hers turned out to be not very flavorful. Overall it was good for me and I would come back. It would be especially good for gluten free eating or low carb as everything is clearly marked GF or not and most of the items are low carb.I'm always working when this place is open so I was excited to try it on a day I was off.  My sandwich was ok I got a turkey cranberry and the bread was just ok. Not enough meat for my taste, but fresh and flavorful.Very cheap massages ($25 for 1 hour), and they often have specials where it is 2 for 1.  Usually during the time period where the "specials" apply is when they are bringing in a new batch of students that need clinical experience.  Your massage will pretty much be a toss up since you are assigned a student at random.  You do have the choice of whether to have a lady masseuse or a man-sseuse.  If you have no preference, chances are you will get a man-sseuse.  I've been here a few times, and so far I've been pretty satisfied with the massages I've gotten considering that they are done by students and also since the price is so reasonable.  If you go, there is just a flat fee, since no tipping is allowed.Been here a couple times and the food is great but the service has been eh..lets just say it could get better. But it wont stop me from coming here! lolGreat store....had just what we needed.back when buffalo, roamed this land
before cowboys & Indians
the west back then, was truly wild
open range, mile after mile
that's when, I guess, buffalo had wings
long before the hooters' thing
and i thought them, long extinct
at least that's what most folks would think
but on the outskirts, all around
the mesa, gilbert, chandler towns
buffalo with wild wings
those feathered, furry, horny things
started landing in strip centers
along with all the other renters
cookie cutter, propagate
i don't dig, this kind of place
suppose, for some, they're a-ok
just glad they build them far away
from my house, they're not my thing
bacon burgers, wings and rings
fried mozzarella....everything 
next generation, burger kings
run of the mill, you know the game
jilly's, chilis, all the same
sysco truck stops, drops food off 
thaw 'em out and heat em up
served in baskets, side of fries
and that, i guess, the reason why
i'm glad that you are out that way
with all the other 'burban chains
and all this time, thought you extinct
brought back i guess, from the brink
outskirts of phoenix,  it's all good
just please don't put one, in my 'hoodUnderstaffed on a Friday night. Not very busy but we spent a lot of time in line. Seats are nothing special, but not gross. I don't think they should be able to charge as much as other theaters with comfortable seats and adequate service. It should be like $7 or $8 for nights and 5-6 for matinee. Not horrible, but not as good as other $10 theaters.Being a Safeway, you don't expect much in the way of extravagance, but it seems like when this store has a product that gets too popular, they discontinue or change it.  For 4 years I have been buying their bakery's jalapeño and cheese focaccia bread, because it was great! Now, they changed the way they bake it and it sucks.  For years I have enjoyed the Kalamata Olives and Feta cheese salad from their deli bar... Now they switched to inferior olives and if you want any Feta with them, you'll have to mix it up yourself.  So, I still shop here because it is convenient and their is a great bank up front, Starbucks and my dry cleaner is in same plaza.  I just wish the management at this Safeway would put about 10% more effort into making this a great supermarket.This Lowe's is *not* closed - I requested the update, but I think I might know why someone could think that.

I went in to return something I didn't need and do a little extra shopping.  When I got to the return counter, someone was being helped.  When he was done, the only employee in the area started wandering around looking confused.  I patiently waited (yes, I can actually do that on occasion) and finally another employee came up and told him to help me.

The return was quick and easy, and then I went off on my search for under cabinet lights.  I spent over 30 minutes wandering the aisles and didn't see one employee that I could ask for help.  They would appear, off in the distance, and then vanish.  Seriously, the Lowe's employees must all be part ninja.  I felt like I was on safari seeking out an elusive and endangered species.  

Ever see one of those Twilight Zones about the last person on earth?  Or a town taken over by zombies.....yeah, it was kinda like that.  In fact, I almost ran over to the garden center to arm myself with a machete inc ase there really were zombies....

I was just about ready to leave and go to their big orange competitor when I found an employee who saved the day.  He helped me find what I was looking for, walked with me to the section, and made sure I had what I needed.  If I had only run into him earlier, this would have been a higher star review.

Overall, their prices are decent if you comparison shop, and it's clean and well organized.Stopped in for  a quick dinner at Rock Springs.

Really great service, but the food was just ok. I know this place is known for its pie, so maybe I should have had that for dinner.

Had the chicken fried steak, and it was ok, but wasn't exactly a taste sensation. I would be back, because the service was fast and charming.Romans is the double wide of bars, reminds me of the old days of livin in the trailer park!  Seriously though, it seems very possible it started as one and they just kept adding rooms on to it, a sczitophrenic's dream. You can walk from one room to the next, live band, karaoke, uhh what were the other rooms again?

I enjoyed myself, I dont live close so I dont get out there very much.  Though after spending $6 on each beer and $9 per shot of Jager, I'll probably stick closer to home. One more side note.. what do I select for parking, "Dirt Lot" isnt listed?Pretty well stocked so whatever "Target-y" think you're looking for they probably have it.  I don't know why they added a grocery section though.  Did Target convert all of their stores into a "Super Target"?  Anyway, this one used to be just a "regular" one.  They did some remodeling to accommodate groceries but the produce section is very slim - mostly all processed foods.  I guess occasionally we'll buy some groceries there but quite honestly, I think they should've just kept it as a regular Target store.  Even with the remodeling, it's still too small of a space to be a "Super" Target.I have never been a big fan of Chinese food..but i have to say this wasn't bad...the fried rice was great and my sweet and sour shrimp was good....the crab Rangoon ehhh not so great.... IF i have a craving for Chinese again i will try againUpdated from 2 stars to 3.

After exchanging a few words with the owner, I decided to give Kyklos another chance this afternoon. I ordered gyro and fries, which came with a drink.

I will correct myself and say that the additional charge is for the feta cheese, not for the sauce. The owner gave me the example of paying extra for cheese on a hamburger, which I understood...I still don't agree with it, but hey...it's not my business. At least they do give you a decent amount of cheese when they put it on there. That, thankfully, they do not skimp on :)

The sign on the soda fountain about charging extra(s) for refills has been taken down.

This time, I did see tomatoes being cut while we were waiting, but that was the only thing that was prepared while we were there. Nice to see that they do some prep work at the actual location.

The meal came and it was still just "okay" for me. There's just minor things that could be done to really make this enjoyable and easier to eat. 

Thankfully, the pita did not fall apart on me this time, but I'm just still not crazy about it. The shredded lettuce still puts me off. I think that it would all stay together a lot better if it were a solid piece on the bottom, but that is just me. Also, the onions could be cut a little smaller instead of long strands.It'd be easier to take a bite, and not have various food items dangling out of your mouth, or squishing and falling onto the plate.

The fries were tough. I like my fries crispy, but they were a little over done for my personal taste. I can say that this is most likely the best  food option that the Galleria food court has to offer.Mall l, but I desperately need a beer break from school shopping. And since I was there, I had to have a burger. Not the best burger in town, but an acceptable alternative when out shoppingWe never, ever have good service here.  About a year ago, we waited at the hostess stand for so long that we decided to leave.  When we got to our car and put it in reverse, all of a sudden, a waitress comes knocking on my window!  It scared the living daylights out of me and made me almost feel sorry for her.  I guess times really ARE hard when a waitress comes outside and figuratively begs for her lost tip.

Anyway, I was dismayed when that same waitress ended up at our table last night.  It was obvious why we waited so long to be seated during the previous visit.... she was slooooooow and seemed completely oblivious to my agitation.  There were only two tables in the whole restaurant, so a glass of water shouldn't take 15 minutes to deliver.  Ugh.  

The three stars are for the STEAK TIPS.  Oh my, they are good.  Whether you get them as a breakfast platter or a dinner platter is irrelevant.  The sides don't matter at all either way.  I haven't actually had more tender, flavorful, and consistently good steak tips anywhere else.  I don't say that lightly either - I'm a carnivorous sort of lady.

So come here if you've got all night to waste, because it's probably gonna take that long to get your order.  But if you order the steak tips, it'll be worth the wait!The michelada is really what brought me here as I've been wanting to try it since I saw my friends postings. Beer of your choice mixed with clamato in a lime/salt/chili rimmed mug....so good!!!

Food is just okay, some were a hit (shrimp ceviche) some were not (fish ceviche). The raw oysters tasted fresh enough and the raw oysters topped with shrimp ceviche was delish.  The fish ceviche tasted "off", kinda mushy, really not to my liking at all.  I've had much better back home in SF...

The seven seas soup had fresh seafood but the broth was quite salty and lacked something...can't quite put my finger on it.. I've had better elsewhere.

My other half had carne sasada and enjoyed his dish, while another of my dining cohorts had the Alhambres- steak/chicken with veggies with cheese.  That was a bit salty also but their rice and beans were actually better than most places.  They served corn tortillas but were not homemade, same kind you buy at the grocery stores...too bad...

Overall- it was just okay, I would go back just for the cheladas and shrimp ceviche.  The prices are kinda steep, the bill came to $166 for the 5 of us, with only 3 people actually ordering entrees, the rest was the drinks and appetizers..I always manage to spend more money here than I anticipate.  I usually try to hit them up on Tuesdays or Thursdays to get their special pricing on bone-in & boneless wings.  I simply order too much food every time.  With all the different options for sauces/dry rubs, it's hard to stick to only a few.

I routinely order the sweet BBQ, parmesan garlic, chipotle, asian zing, desert heat, carribean jerk, thai curry & lemon pepper.  Add a couple rounds of beer, bleu cheese, celery, plus tip & you are looking at an $80+ tab easy.  Damn!  So much for a cheap meal of chicken wings.  This place use to be better years ago.  Maybe I'm just burnt out on it or I over do it?  I use to consider them 4 star, but through the years they have managed to lose one.  

FYI...the blazin' sauce is inedible.  Only order it if you have company/relatives you don't like joining  you.  It will be an experience they will not forget.  =)BEST place to go whether you woke up hungover, still drunk, or just craving pho after partying all night at the club. Sure, it may not compare to pho in San Jose (if you're ever up in norcal you've gotta try Pho Kim Long in SJ!) or Westminster, but this is the best pho you're gonna get in vegas. And it sure beats the americanized version they serve at TI.

And I've never made it after a night at XS, but it's open 24 hrs so you can get a headstart on that hangover cure.Decent food, nothing spectacular. Service is so-so, like any other chinese restaurant. We had about 10 different dishes, everything was ok and no after-the-fact rections so I guess that's a plus :) Definitely decent asian food in Vegas.3 1/2 stars

It was different. I like the atmosphere and warmth this place gives, it was very inviting. The vibe was calm and I enjoyed it. At first I thought this place literally grilled macaroni and I had no idea it was based on Italian food.

Service is quick and our waiter was very informative, she told us what the specials were and what kind of foods were good like the calamari. She also informed us about what kind of wine they had.

At first I got water because I didn't really know what kind of drinks were available but later when I felt comfortable enough I went ahead and ordered a Mojito and it was alright, I enjoyed it though. As for my main entree, I ordered the Filet steak with mash potato w/lobster. It was good, the meat had a good sear and was juicy, not too juicy though since I got it medium well done. I loved the mash potatos, I just wish there was a little more lobster, it was something new to me and it was great experiencing it... mash potato's and lobster who'd knew?

This place emphasized extra virgin olive oil almost on everything especially with the bread which left me wondering if they wanted us to hurry up and leave or it was made to make us feel full and satisfied, I assume it's to make us feel full and satisfied and I appreciate the strategy. Over all I enjoyed my experience with Macaroni Grill. I'd like to come back and check out the pasta dishes next time.It's hard to find good Pho places in LV, this place was ok. Egg rolls were good and came out quick, were steaming hot too. Pho broth i think could go for a bit more flavor. other then that, service was good and pho was okNot all that great but it's just so cheap. Of the stuff we ordered, my least favorite would have to be the marinated rib-eye. The marinade was pretty bad. I also would not reorder the marinated pork belly, as that's cut into strand like pieces, not large thick slices like the regular pork belly. Speaking of the pork belly, not as thick as I like that other places do. The first round of brisket we ordered was good. The second round however was cut so thin that it just kept flaking apart as we tried cooking it. Picking up shreds of meat is not a fun way to eat. This was probably related to the service.

So speaking of the service, it wasn't that bad if you consider they were seriously understaffed. Every BBQ-able table was filled up, which is a little more than half the restaurant. As far as I could tell, there was one server and one person working the kitchen.

The orders of meat usually come out in pretty small quantities on a small plate too. Don't know why they did that while being understaffed. The salad mix they give you on the side is delicious, probably my favorite Korean BBQ salad anywhere.

Eventually we stopped eating because: 1. it took so long to get our next order of meat and more salad (I think they ran out and kept having to make more) and 2. the grill was so small that it was hard for everyone to keep eating at a good pace.

Even with all the negative comments, I'd still give it 3 stars because it's decent and so affordable.I came by this location right before closing time to order a bunch of fried chicken for my friends.  They were out of a lot of stuff, but the guy was nice enough to throw in what he could.  Chicken was delicious, though.  Worth the drive over the KFC that was around the corner.I went here with a couple of friends for the Lunch Buffet on a Tuesday.

The decor and service are excellent. The platter was not extravagant but decent. May be we have just been spoiled by other buffets. The samosas were tasting good but were cold. Rest of the dishes all tasted the same. The ingredients changed but the taste was the same, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. For a restaurant, that has advertised all over LV bus shelters and supposedly been the best Indian Restaurant from 2001-06, it was quiet a disappointing buffet. But otherwise, there neither anything right nor anything wrong with the food. Just Okay.

Will try the Ala Carte and may be that'll change my opinion.Just came back from Vegas where I stayed at the Palace Station for three nights during a convention.

Overall I can say it was a good experience. After reading reviews here I opted to get a room in the tower. I think that was a wise choice after seeing some pics that some fellow convention goers posted of their courtyard rooms. My tower room as clean, modern and spacious. No complaints.

Not much to choose from as far as bars or restaurants in the hotel. I was happy to see they had a Starbucks and a Subway. Most of my meals were spent at the Grand Cafe a 24 hour diner with cheap eats. It was fair dining. 

The lobby is a bit run down and the casino itself...smokey but hey...I was there for a convention so  didn't spend much time in either. 

I actually had time to enjoy the pool area to which they have two sections...a north and south pool. I guess my only complaint is they need to be better labeled. When calling for some pool side drinks I was asked which I was at....ugh...I have no idea. How about either labeling the pool area, menu that is posted next to the phone or hey....getting caller ID so you know which pool people are calling from. 

In the end I'd have no problem staying here if there was another convention I was attending in the hotel.There's a certain type of Japanese restaurant where most of the food is small cooked dishes for reasonable prices and the menu is mostly on the wall. This is the kind of place a businessman would go to after work to drink with his co-workers, and snack while they discuss whatever. This isn't a go-to place for sushi. This isn't a formal romantic evening. You're not paying for the posh atmosphere.

Everything is well prepared, the menu (both on paper and additional items on the walls) are varied and incorporate traditional dishes and contemporary food as well. Price was very very low, and the place is packed even in the middle of the week, so arrive early or plan to wait (dunno if they have reservations.)

Personal recommendations would be the chicken gizzards, wasabi octopus, shishito skewers, and my absolute favorite would be the honey toast box is a must try too!

If you're looking for japanese food, come here. If you're looking for some good eats with a little sushi, come here. If you want a full blown 7-course sushi meal with lots of nigiri, this might not be the place for you.Had a delicious steak and salad here while I was in town.   I was very happy with my meal there but what keeps this at a three stars is that there were several waiters that assisted us during our dining experience but the the main one treated us horribly.   He treated us like we were inexperienced diners at steakhouses due to a couple questions.   I honestly felt such a genuine air of elitism it was very uncomfortable.   Everyone else was very nice though and the only thing that made up for it was the delicious steak.I am conflicted on where I stand on Gerardo's Barber Shop. When I look at the sides, I am more than excited to spread the word on how well they did. I asked for a fade that was cut down to 1 1/2. I could not be happier with how it turned out. The clean workmanship and attention to details with a razor is impeccable. My problem lies with how they handle the crown of hair. I asked for a trim and got a good inch lopped off straight across. 

I know that this is a barber shop and not a salon, but am still in shock by lack of attention. The idea that it was not measured out and cut to how the hair grows would throw most people off because it has no consistency. Good thing my work is completely accepting of more unique hairstyles.Believe it or not this little restaurant was very good at one point- this was years ago. I really liked the crispy fried oysters. My family and I used to come here, too (family dinners at good prices). Years later, it's become a so-so/ok place (but there are better places out there, so why come here? kind of a place). There is a cheap lunch special (lots of choices) that keeps bringing customers; also there might be regulars who live in the area helping this place stay afloat. The bathroom is passable but it could be cleaner. The last time we came here to eat, there was a couple strange patrons so we haven't come back. It's just better to spend our money at a place that we really like, ya know? Life is short, so make the most of it.This is the second time we have eaten here for breakfast when we've come to Vegas. It's a little way off strip and the first time we came here it was a mission trying to find it. I am sad to say that I don't think this place has the same owners as the last time we were here. The food was mediocre, the pancakes were smaller, the staff was nowhere! We waited for about 15min after we were seated for a waitress to even come over and inquire to our existence. It was all downhill from there. If it were for the fact that we were already very hungry, I think we would have probably left. The pancakes were still good, light and fluffy, they just were the same. Sad to say, just won't be going back.The Skinny: come for the fantastic eggroll bread and the red bean buns but be warned... the pineapple buns and egg tart are only okay (3.75), service - friendly efficient (3), value - got a loaf of bread, two specialty buns and a dan tat (egg tart) for $6 which isn't too bad (3)

Went in to purchase some nice Asian bakery treats. The style of bakery goods here reflect the fusion of cultures you see in Hong Kong. We were excited by the spread so we purchased a red bean bun, a pineapple bun filled with red bean, a eggroll loaf (kind of like an Asian challah) and a egg tart (aka dan tat).

The eggroll loaf is really great - a wonderful, soft and airy texture. A mildly subtle aroma of butter and egg with that perfect hint of sweetness makes this one of the best bakery finds in a while. After a day, it still retains its moisture which is surprising in the Las Vegas climate. At $2.50 a loaf, a very affordable find.

I enjoyed the red bean paste inside the red bean bun immensely. The red bean paste here is different from the red bean paste you find in Japanese bakeries. Using a smaller variety of bean, it tends to have a more robust flavour, darker red colour. Sunville makes a great bean paste with the perfect balance of sweetness and textures (love the little bits of bean in there!). Overall, the bun could have used more red bean paste and the texture of the bun could be a little more dense to support the paste inside. But still one of the most enjoyable red bean buns I've had in a while.

Of this visit, we did have two disappointments. 

First the egg tart. The egg tart has a shortbread/cookie crust on it. Not my preferred type of crust (the puff pastry crust is sooo much better) but if it's made right, it'll do in a pinch when the craving for egg tarts hits. Unfortunately, the crust lacks enough butter flavour here and becames rather soggy  (when I took a bite in the car, the crust was okay but by the evening, it was soggy). The flavour of the custard is not eggy and the texture wasn't silky enough. The egg tarts here are only okay in my book.

Pineapple buns, in all of their varieties, are near and dear to my heart. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll get another round of the pineapple buns here. The strusel on top lacked the melt-in-your mouth sugar cookie like crust that makes my mouth do a jig. The topping was too moist and gummy for my taste. The bun itself with the red bean inside was good but the crust was a clear miss.

Overall, stick to the eggroll bread and red bean buns and you'll be happy.Old, shitty bar which is redeemed by the lively crowd you'll find there. Wouldn't call it a dive bar as it doesn't have any unique physical characteristics; it's just a plain, run-down piece of crap that's frequented by fun people3 stars because their potatoes balls stuffed with ground beef were delicious.  Otherwise...

...Florida Cafe turned out to be a huge letdown for me.  For years, I've wanted to try this place that I keep hearing about from people, seeing ads for on bus stops...

So one night after CES, we made last minute reservations to go.  They weren't busy...I mean, seriously, who goes to a HoJo (Howard Johnson) for dinner?  (Apparently, they're also big on weddings - saw a wedding party and huge limo milling around the parking area.)

As I said, our starter, the potato balls were great.  That got us even more excited for our actual food.  We shared the following:

FC's "Famous" black bean soup - Served not quite hot, which was strike #1...and basically it was just...beans.  A big ole bowl of black beans cooked for a long time.  They weren't great, flavorful or anything. It congealed as it cooled and after about 10 minutes, was no longer in the realm of appetizing.

Cuban Sandwich - Unlike the soup, this dish was served lava-hot.  Even 20 minutes after it was served to us, we still burnt our tongues on the cheese.  Though not as disappointing as the soup, the sandwich was still underwhelming.  There was no real flavor that stood out.  The "pickled" veggies that they put in the sandwich weren't nearly noticeable.

Beans & Rice - Ok...really?  Cubans make their rice with Uncle Ben's boil in a bag dealio?  Really.  The description of the dish mentioned black beans mixed in with pork bits.  Delicious right?  Wrong.  I got myself a big plate of terribleness.  It smelled like instant rice and tasted like it.  I like how the rice comes served molded in a bowl which they lift away as they present it to you. My, how that Uncle Ben's rice scattered as soon as the bowl was taken away.  What's the point of molding it?

Service was decent and for that and the potato balls, I'm giving FC 3 stars thought I quite believe I'm being very generous.Thry have a seperate eating area which is a plus for some that may not wanna smell like smoke but want the bar atmosphere . bald head bartender is very cool and attentive . they have a late night happy hour drinks/food which is cool the wings ive ordered tend to be on the more salty side garlic parmesan lemon pepperPineapple fried rice and papaya salad.  I'm really not a big fan of the latter and half of it was nothing but a big chopped off chunk of totally raw supermarket cabbage.  The former was pretty good, though it tasted as tho it may have been  flavored with ketchup.  2 1/2 rounded up to 3.Yes and No. YES to the cosmetic store part and absolutely NO to the salon. (It's a shame I couldn't rate these separately because I could give the store a 5 and the salon a 1) 
_________
The store: I love shopping at Ulta, me and my mom have been shopping there for years and have never had any problems. Returning products is a painless and quick process (even after they have been opened) and they have some amazing deals. It has almost everything I could ever need, so I rarely shop anywhere else. The workers are pleasant, and though not overly helpful/knowledgeable, they are nice.   
_________
The salon: If you value your hair, just don't. I decided to try it out once since I always shop at Ulta, and it was the biggest mistake of my life. I wanted an a-line with side-swept bangs, which one of the hair stylists had so I was able to point out that I wanted my hair to look exactly like hers. The girl who was cutting my hair claimed that she was the one who had cut the other stylist's a-line and side-swept bangs, so I was thrilled to have her cut my hair. 

I might as well have gotten my haircut at a slaughter house. Instead of the a-line that was suppose to be shoulder length in the front I got a bob that went to my chin, and instead of the side-swept bangs I pretty much got blunt, straight across bangs. It looked absolutely terrible! I cried after and had to wear hair extensions for the next 6 months until it grew out enough to get it redone.

To top it all off, I demanded a refund, hair extensions or anything really to fix the butcher job that was done on my hair. Nothing. All they could give me were their excuses on how my hair was 'too thick' to do the side-swept bangs (oh really? no one could tell me this before I got my haircut?), how it did look like the other stylist's hair (I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was blind and retarded), and whatever other bs they thought they could possibly feed me.  

They refused to do a refund, refused to do anything except offer a free haircut on my next visit. Yeah. Right. Like I was ever going to let them touch my hair a second time. It was literally the worst haircut I had ever gotten.Had the crab-stuffed shrimp with seasonal veggies (broccoli and carrots at the time) and dirty rice. It was okay. Not mind-blowing, not terrible. Also had the Shark Bite cocktail with Bacardi Limon Rum, Skyy Vodka, sweet and sour, blue curaçao and a touch of grenadine. The grenadine came on the side of the glass in a test tube with a little shark plastic figure. Cute.

Hubby had the Alaskan King Crab Legs with the Joe's Famous BBQ flavor. We both found it delicious. Hubby's grandma had either oysters or mussels, garlic flavored which she liked. Said it had a slight kick of spice to it.

Waiter was okay. Not overjoyed to be serving us, not entirely bummed out. Overall, an okay experience.This is my to-go grocery store. I've come to like it more than the Wal-Mart that is near by. It has better meats, vegetables, and fruits to choose from. I have the rewards card so most of the foods I buy are marked down which is helpful. I do recommend everyone get a card when they shop here because I bought meats that were up to 26$ and with the rewards card it can mark down to as much as 12$! I don't know about you but that's a steal!

I wouldn't buy alcohol here though, it's kind of on the pricey side. Although my favorite Moscato is only 7$! 

The staff aren't really that helpful, it's pretty much a hit or miss. But it's pretty clean & organized and it gets the job done!I went on a Monday morning and the place had customers but it wasn't super busy. It took some time to order because the menu was different from the ones in Cali. Finally, we decided on Pecan Waffles and Corned Beef Hash. The food came out faster than it took to decide.

The pecan waffles were yummy! The waffle was fluffy and a little bit sweet just how I like it. 

The corned beef hash looked like they opened a can of Libby's and then barely warmed it up in a pan. I have to say Libby's taste much better. It was nothing like the corned beef hash at the California locations.

I definitely will be back just for pancakes and waffles. I might take a chance on other breakfast meats but I would stay away from the corned beef hash.The place is pretty crowded most of the time, so the first time i was here the waiter was super unattentive and we got charged 14 dollars for an OATMEAL?! say whuuuuu, it's 5 dollars for fresh strawberries, uhmm they give you like 5 chopped up strawberries, then its 3 dollars for half a banana, such a rip off they dind't tell us, although the manager did take off money which was super nice, then i got my baby cousin a silver dollar chocolate chip pancakes with no whip cream and no powdered sugar, guess what, they put all of that on, ohkay wow, so lastly i got the chocolate chip pancakes it was pretty good, but the whip cream is a bit too thick, and after about 2 pancakes, you really don't wanna eat it anymore, you feel really groggy and gross, although it is delicious, the second time i came it was a lot better, but still.Located on the lovely stretch of road known as Boulder Hwy., this Denny's is fondly known to my friends and I as Beer Denny's.  If we're feeling' especially white trash, we'll show up here for a 3 PM breakfast accompanied by a Bud Light. 

The service is usually slow, the food is just Denny's food, but the fact that this is a Beer Denny's makes it win just a little.It's a UPS Store. I needed some papers faxed and they do faxing. Cost me 2.50 each page but the process was painless and they gave me a free cover sheet as well as printed the confirmation on the back of the cover sheet to save paper.

If anyone has a USAA account, UPS stores now offer a method of cash deposits. Basically 2 dollars of what ever you're depositing goes toward a money order for the amount you're depositing (up to a thousand i think) and they deposit the rest via your atm/debit card. No more depositing into another bank then filling out a check from one account to deposit@home to the USAA account which is how i've been doing it.

Fast, friendly and knowledgeable service.The ONLY reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because I researched a bit before the man and I decided on it, knowing full well what we were getting into.  Otherwise, it is a 2 star, if that.  To those who are complaining here...SUCKERS!  The internet can be used for things other than porn...and Yelp.  Moving on...

The man and I had an impromptu "let's get the hell out of Dodge" moment and we seized it.  We stayed here Tues, December 29 - Thursday, December 31.  We picked this place because it was cheap and close to the Strip (even though Downtown is better).    Based on the reviews, we were willing to risk some things.  So here is the summary:

* Yes, we did witness the parking garage elevator not working.  But it was only once out of 4 times using it and we were not hauling our bags in or out, so we were fine with walking 4 flights of stairs to the car.  To the poor ladies hauling out kids, bags and strollers....sorry.

*The bed was stiff as a board.  I can handle firm, but there was no bounce to this bed at all. 

*The plumbing system is old, but works.  Slow drain sink, slow flush toilet.  

*Our room was not dirty, just dated.

* We got hot water all the time, just fine.  I even took a shower around 11:00 a.m. and there was still plenty of water.

*Our room was missing the "DO NOT DISTURB" sign, which we only learned about when we heard the maids coming around and we needed to act on it.  I went to get one from the maids, but they did not have one.  I ran into one downstairs and she did not have one.  Another employee told me I had to get one from reception, so fine.  I asked for one and was told she would call someone to bring it up.  Totally inefficient and it does not make me happy when I have a hangover.

As for the casino...

*The free $100 slot play promotion is definitely one of those "too good to be true" things.  After you sign up for the lame Player's Club (I lost my card somewhere in the casino), you get a voucher and you walk into a roped off area.  An employee will insert a $100 bill into one machine that you choose.  They are $5 slot machines and you have to play the max (so $10 a pull).  If you are lucky enough to get to 1700 credits, you get $50.  Other than that, you are screwed.  Total lameness.

*Takes the cocktail waitresses FOREVER to bring you a drink.  I hate getting sober when I am waiting to get hammered.  

*Beware of the slow dealers that come on shift at 2:00 a.m. -- they may put you to sleep.

Overall, take heed of the reviews and make the decision yourself.  Will we stay here again?  Probably not.  But we do not think we made a bad decision since we went into it informed.Busy night on Thursday but solid service. Pho was mediocre with the broth arriving to our table lukewarm. Not ideal. Also had beef spring rolls, good not great. Overall I've had better Vietnamese in Vegas.Food was good, drink prices were alright. I tend to be surprised when barstaurants can't split c.hecksthis place has the best view in the city. The food is good but way overpriced. they have deals online as I would not eat there unless I used a promo code for discounts. it is an amazing view...best in vegasI ordered some cod meals to go.  Price was fine.  Fish were cooked well and serving size was average.   Service was quick.  Amy Kent/Jazz was playing in the background which was nice.   Tartar sauce was too small a serving for the fish.  Parking was difficult to find a close spot.   They looked pretty busy.
I hoped the fish would have been better and of a larger serving.  If I go back it won't be for the fish.
Let me be a little bit more explanatory.   I opted against Culver's for a fish dinner because I feel their fish is overpriced for a fast food take home meal.   So I decided to try Avanti Italian Restaurant to see if I could get a better meal.  I didn't.   Culver's is better hands down.  Thus, just because a restaurant is "fast food" doesn't really hold true in this scenario.
I found a nice pub in Avanti to whit I would like to try again.   But for fish I would recommend Culver's.  Avanti does however have an all you can eat fish dinner for about 18 dollars.   So if you want to eat a lot of fish you can take advantage of this.   Myself, however, would maybe eat one or two more pieces which would be about 3 dollars per extra piece.   I think this is rather pricey.   All you can eat for 15 would be more appropriate I think and I will spend the extra 3 dollars on another beer anyway.
I am not an restauranteur though and I could be wrong.  But I think the lower price would draw more diners over time and drive better sales and more profits.
Think about it.   If someone goes to Culver's for 11 dollars and then finds they can get an all you can eat meal at Avanti for 15 it becomes a no-brainer and more people go to Avanti for fish on friday night.   But their fish has to be better than Culver's.  Which at this time it is close but not better.
A few ways Avanti could improve their meal and Culver's too for that matter would be to provide a better tartar sauce in a larger quantity, larger slices of lemon, a whole grain bread rather than a bland slice of bread at Avanti and a wonder bun white from Culver's.  Avanti makes a baked potato which you cannot get at Culvers.   The baked potato is worth an extra buck to my mind.  But good fish trumps this one.  I opt for Culver's on this one.Well, if you ignore the meager decor and shitty shitty service, this place rocks!! Lots of food with a great curry sauce.  Last time I ate here with my mom, the lady heling us didn't speak a single word and glared at us the entire time.  The food is too good to pass up though...and the two of us ate there for about $18.....3 stars.Tried out Vientiane for lunch...many menu options, reasonable prices, and huge portions. They had about five lunch specials that were only $6-7. 

We tried the Pad Thai with tofu, which was pretty good. We also had the daily curry special with tofu, which was very tasty. The spring rolls were ok...nothing to write home about.

Service is definitely not their strong point. Don't expect a cheery greeting when you walk in. After waiting for the check for about 10 minutes, we finally realized that your bill is waiting for you at the counter, where you pay and ask for take-out boxes. Overall, decent thai food.Definitely miss State Street Brats. The place on game day or any day. Another reason why I got fat during college.The flat bread is fantastic and so is the hummus. Had the chicken curry with couscous. Not impressed by the curry but the chicken was fall-off-the bone. Staff not exceptional but it was the tail end of a busy friday night so I can understand.Outstanding bakery, deli with prepared foods and superb butcher selections with homemade sausage. The produce is also of the highest quality. This is a fun store and a little pricey.Whelp... one week I found a radtastic solid wood import from India... a rocking buffet that would look great in my new place, but the next week it was gone. I'm not knocking stars because I'm an idiot and can't make a decision to save my life (if it was meant to be it would have been there, right), I'm knocking some stars because there's little to no organization and outside of the folks up front who'll check you out, I don't know that they staff the joint. I had a few questions but wasn't able to track anyone down which was a bummer. Stock is always changing (grumble, grumble) so it's worth repeat visits if you're just browsing.I have been here twice now. First time I would give 4 stars. I had a pasta special and tried some of my friend's spinach, bacon and olive oil pizza. Service was great, ambiance was cool and food was very good.

The second time is tough. I'd give the food (pepperoni and sausage pizza) 4.5 and the service a 1 or 0. We arrived last Friday night at 9:15-9:30pm. My boyfriend and I were seated right away and given menus. We said we needed a minute to decide on our drinks. After 15 mins of looking around for our waiter, I finally went to the bar to order drinks and say we couldn't find our waiter. The bartender apolgized and brought our drinks. The waiter came back shortly and asked if we were ready. We ordered garlic bread and the pizza. The garlic bread never came and we thought it may come with the pizza. Finally the pizza came (which was delicious) and our drinks were empty. He never brought the garlic bread or apologized. At that point I didn't care. He took my credit card and came back with the check and didn't run the card. I had to remind him I gave him my card. He may have been really tired or just not "completely there". Anyway, I'd come back to give the place another chance because the food is good and I saw a few other servers giving other tables good service while we were there.My main reason I enjoy My Florist Cafe is for the music, I love listening to Nicole play.   Live music over cocktails and dinner is something I really like and rare to find a place that does them both well.

For the most part the food is good and have really never had an issue with it however I will say there isn't anything on the menu that is my favorite.   The meals are a little pricey for what you get however figure that is also the price for the entertainment.  

As for the drink menu, that's a different story with the Steinway being my favorite.  

I like Todd B's comments about eating something and realizing there is something missing; I think that best explains it.   It's missing the wow.  

The decor and location is nice and the restaurant clean comfortable.   I will be back as I do enjoy the dinner and music combo and look forward to find something wow on the menu one day.  As we normally go in a group of six, this seems to be the overall feedback.We were in the Phoenix area a few weekends ago and after we saw that Los Reyes de la Tortas was overflowing, I did a quick yelp search and saw that I had bookmarked OHW and we headed on over. The place has a huge dining room and a bar and patio off the back. 

They were out of zucchini when we were there (huge sad face), but my friend and I each got a burger and some fries. They were pretty good, but they weren't the best burgers I've ever had in my life. I'd probably try it again if I was in the area, but I'm sure there are better burger places aroundSecond most expensive oil change, ever. For $70, it should include a massage. I guess they figure since you have a Jag, you wouldn't bat an eye at $70. They don't consider broke ho's like me with 18 year old Jags.

I do give them props for not trying to upsell you fifty bucks worth of extras (hello, Jiffy Lube!). They also call you when your car is due again. If I was getting that kind of cash each time a customer came in, I'd be on the horn too.

I can't say anything about their repair service. But they seem to have plenty of business. Their parking lot is always full of Jags. Apparently they work on Rovers too.This small place is easy to miss but worth finding so look hard for it.  The food is always good although the amount of spice in the food depends on who is in the kitchen.   One time I ordered basil fried rice at 2 stars and it was fine, a week later same dish too hot to eat at when ordered with 2 stars.  Next time same dish 2 stars and no spice at all.  I like it but will try Touch of Thai next.When you walk out of the beat up parking lot, look up the aged store front, walk pass into the aged low decor 1970s style interior, and get seated by the waiters, the visual setup creates the expectation that the food would be on par-disappointing. But you would be wrong, the food really is good here commensurate with the price.

We have a big menu of affordable dishes to order from . After we ordered our food, they arrive within a reasonable amount of time. The imperial Hue soup is flavorable, spicy and temperature hot, and filling. The seafood floured soup is one of the best and non greasy dish that they have. The seat-in experience is acceptable; save by the food. There is not a whole lot of customer to employee interaction.

This is not a place to experience a quiet dinner(as there are noisy kids) or to impress a date. It's a drive by, eat and get out place.

If I were to come in just to order 2 dishes to-go, the wait could be an agonizing 15-20 minutes. The wait could feel like forever as there is nothing to distract the customer like a TV. Better luck calling in with a menu in hand.

Overall for business improvement on a dime:  I would recommend they 

1) Update and remodel the outside and inside decor to make it attractive for outsiders to come in.
2) Work on lessening the variability and wait time from the cooking by lessening  the number of  similar menu items. 
3). This family run business works way too hard such that they have no spare slack to make improvements. 

The food outperforms the other experienced qualities. Given that there are lots of good Asian restaurants nearby to chose from, I hope to see them do some innovating from a service and experience perspective as other local Pho places are progressing in that direction.Perhaps I'm a bit jaded.  I know good restaurants and Red Lobster at Metro is fine.  Food like all the other red lobsters.  What sets this apart from all the rest is the service.  That's why I'm writing this review.  
My wife and I went to R.L. last night.  She had the lobster pizza and I had lobster nachos.  She drank water.  I had Sam Adams draught.  The beer was wonderful.  The pizza is and has always been very very goodl.  The nachos were also good.
A five star rating goes to our waiter, Doug.  First, he was an adult man who had personality.  Could describe each dish you ordered in mouth watering terms.  Made pleasant conversations and banter and was on top of all our needs before we knew what our needs were.
Should you go there, ask to sit at one of Doug's tables.  YOu won't be sorry.I thought Top Shelf was good! As good as Macayo's or Valle Luna.  Had the grilled fish tacos. Fish was good but was served as a typical taco with flour tortilla, tomato, lettuce and cheese. That was kind of a disappointment. Others in the party enjoyed their food and I really liked the rice and beans! Service was great!it's a school, enough said. not sure what they are teaching in there but my nephew comes home saying things like " that's COO" or "uncle i'm gonna be late for SCHOO" .Loved the ambience and the couch was very very comfortable. Our waitress was sweet. Didn't like the pancakes or the sandwich much, but the monaco hash (made vegetarian) was really good. 
Fun place, but a little expensive for the quality of food.Oh Kona Grill, how you bring back memories.  

I first discovered Kona Grill's happy hour back in college, the lure of the $2.50 Ladies Margarita and the half price happy hour menu fit right in to my college budget!  Although the shopping after too many $2.50 Ladies Margarita's didn't, but that's a story for another day.

I went to Happy Hour at Kona yesterday for the first time in awhile, and oddly enough, it was with some of my old college buddies.  We were excited for cheap food and drinks, because even though we aren't in college anymore, we still love cheap eats!

It was a bit cold and rainy yesterday, so we were able to easily find a table on the patio (HH is only available on the patio and bar....so getting a seat sometimes turns into a stakeout!). We were a bit disappointed to see that the HH menu was a bit different than before; instead of just all the sushi and apps and pizzas being half price, they were bunched into groups by price.  Some of the prices were still half off, but others, like the Edamame ($4.00 regularly and $3.00 during HH) were not that great of a deal.  Being that it we were quite hungry, we ordered some sushi, edamame, calamari, chicken tacos, avocado egg rolls and the potstickers.  All of the food was much like we remembered, with the calamari being our overwhelming favorite, so crispy with the spicy sauce, yum!  We were a bit disappointed to see that the tacos no longer came with the yummy fried rice like they used to, but it wasn't the end of the world.  The sushi was good, but not the best I have ever had, but fresh nonetheless.  The biggest bummer about the sushi was that most of the rolls that we wanted weren't on the HH menu, especially since they were only $6.00 to begin with the HH sushi rolls were all $3.00....didn't make sense to us.

I know I will go back to Kona, but only during happy hour, I don't love it enough to pay full price!I had the breakfast quesadilla. As far as quesadilla's go is was pretty good. I loved that combination, seasonal veggies, sausage, egg, cheese. They could be a little more generous with the protein, and most of the quacamole was turning brown (not exactly appetizing), but overall it was good. The salsa that it came with was the redeemed the old guacamole.

However, the person who served the guacamole could have been a little more sensible and not served brown guac. Instead, it looked like it was mixed in with the nice looking guacamole as if I wouldn't notice.Sephora is wonderful for the range of products that they keep in stock.  I loved my experience there.  The staff was most excellent in assisting.  With that said there is a very fine line where assisting becomes annoying your customer beyond belief.  Please stop with the pushing of this product and that product.  Also please remember the personal stuff that you discuss @ the register isn't always for the general public.My husband wanted to get a dream catcher for the little one, visiting Arizona and all. I came here yesterday with my family. They had a great price for a large one, but no choice for color - just black. We ended up getting 2 smaller ones, blue and white. Assistance from a young male working there lacked in the "niceness" department. Kind of a smart alec.Great food, service, atmosphere, and margaritas... ruined by horrific lighting.. awful/bright fluorescent lighting!  Too bad..., such an easy change would make the ambience so much better!

Glad the place has not been updated!  Love the authentic feel.. there's already too many 'new' places in Scottsdale, we don't need another.

Hated the salsa served in a carafe to pour on a plate!  Who thought that would be enjoyable?!!

A Mexican restaurant with only three margaritas on the menu?  Where's the silver coin?

Loved the food and great service!!Everybody loves this place, and maybe because of all the word of mouth i was expecting something spectacular, but i was just kind of like, oh, so this is Kazimierz...ok.

i was also put off by the very poor attitude of the door guy. my boyfriend took me there for valentine's day, and the door guy kept us outside and hounded me over my ID while i chattered my answers through my teeth in my dressy top. i'm not a jerk about these things, either, i know i look young and these guys are just doing their job, but he was seriously going out of his way to be crappy about it.

anyway, we made it inside finally and the food was pretty good. i had a walnut/pear salad and we shared one of their pizzas. my date thought the pizza was amazing while i found it to be so-so. the live entertainment was nice, but too loud.

i think i'm just such a die-hard fan of postino's in phoenix that with my first impression being the door guy i never gave it a fair chance. but still, i'll pick Postino's over this place any day.Stay tuned. I actually fly to Portland, OR to get my haircut, I'm so picky about who touches/cuts my hair. I don't mind spending the money, (I mean I pay to fly to Portland, OR for gosh sakes!) but I need someone who is KNOWS different types of hair, how it reflects the light, and how to cut it best--depending on the hair type- curly, wavy, thin, thick, you get the idea. Color and cut are completed by two different people. They were able to schedule me, last minute...so kudos. So far. 
Hair cut was done by the Salon Manager, it was fine. She even had me come back to do some fine tuning. Hair cut was solid.Ooooookay.  Here is the deal about buca.  I do enjoy the food but I am very outraged by the prices.  The waiter here has a crush on bradford and I'm straight but brad is a sexy guy.  

Soe we got a couple of beers and an app and three meals for over a hundred clams after tax and tip.  So 1 star is deducted.  

If you go there get the chicken saltimbocca.  Sheer delight!Martini Ranch is that girl who tries to look chic and a little messy like one of the Olson twins, but doesn't quite pull it off and ends up looking disheveled and a little manic. The place just seems a little out of place in Scottsdale's glitzy and glamorous nightclub scene. Their only redeeming quality is their live music shows. There aren't too many bars/clubs that offer a venue for up in coming artists -- especially not any as big as Martini Ranch. 

In all honesty, I'm not much of a club girl -- or a Scottsdale girl for that matter-- but Martini Ranch isn't that great outside of their live music offerings. I checked-out their "Shaker Room." It was sad. It was a little pathetic with weird stripper poles. And it played really bad dance music. They've got plenty of drink offerings, but they are somewhat pricey. I paid $9 for a rum & Coke and that seemed a little outrageous to me (although , it could be that I am just a cheap-ass) 

Despite Martini Ranch's awkwardness, it isn't a horrible place to hang and enjoy some entertainment. There is quite a mix of people that pass through the place, which is kind of a nice departure from the young, silicon fakeness often seen on the streets of downtown Scottsdale.

In the end, though, if some of my favorite bands return, I am pretty sure I'll be making a trip back to the Ranch. The next time I may just stick to their $3 Bud Lights... or perhaps be a little less stingy and splurge on a Martini.Pretty neat place if you're a baseball fan.   But the food is very, very, average.  I ordered their most expensive steak my only time there in 2012 and it was beyond disappointing.  Shortly after a local told me you go there for the ambiance, not the food.   Now I get it.... I'll return with friends but I'll keep the food simple next time.I don't see what everyones problem with this place is. It's not bad at all if you have a group of friends you are hanging out with and just are out for a good time. It's a great place to take east coasters, and an even better place to take someone on their power hour. The drinks are inexpensive for scottsdale, and the bartenders are pretty quick. We were there on a somewhat busy night and didn't have to wait for drinks at all. The atmosphere is kind of lame, and the patio is so small that the smokers are basically smoking in the doorway to the club causing for it to smell smokey. 
-1 for smoke/layout
+1 for the cool bartendersI went again today, and got the Avocado rolls. Nothing special... The green tea smelled like feet and was cold. I'm sorry RA, I know you hang out the cool kids, but if I want sushi I'm going to find someplace a little less mediocre.Happy Hour prices were amazing here - I enjoyed a solitary evening during a business trip - food and drinks all within the "per diem" budget.

Service is questionable while the crowd - oh well, it's Arizona - what do you expect?All in all, it was an ok dinner. I liked the atmosphere, even though it was a bit loud. We started with edamame, which was fresh and hot. A good start. 

The sushi roll menu had too many items with crab mix... I think it's their attempt to keep prices down and profits up. There wasn't anything very inventive on the menu, but we found a couple of rolls and some tuna and salmon nigiri to order. The nigiri was ultra fresh and tasty, just not very big. The shrimp tempura roll was ok, and of course came with crab mix. Odd. The beef tenderloin roll sounded better than it was. It lacked flavor and pow. 

But, the drinks were good and reasonable. Three stars for the drinks and nigiri.Take advantage of happy hour to get a good, reasonably priced sample of the rolls and other appetizers that RA offers.  They have good drink specials too.

I dropped in for a late dinner last night.  My only complaint was that the music was loud for my tastes,  I didn't know they had a dj spin on Sunday nights.  If you're into that, by all means, it's worth the trip.I'm so torn on this review...I like the pizza at Grimaldi's. It's not life changing good, but it's very good. I especially like their crust, you can tell they have good pizza ovens.

You walk in and you feel like you're in an old school Italian place...Pretty cool. Red checkered table cloths, Sinatra type music playing, you get the drift. Service is attentive and usually pretty quick. Even if the restaurant is busy they seem to staff it appropriately so your food won't take forever. The wait to get in can be really long, especially on weekends in the fall and winter (AKA tourist/snow bird season).

The thing that kills me about Grimaldi's is the price. It's expensive for what you get. The prices seem reasonable when you sit down, there are different price points for the different sauce options (red/white/pesto), and a large pizza is base priced at $18. Doesn't seem bad, but that's just for sauce and cheese. It's when you start adding toppings that your bill will skyrocket. For example: I came here a few weeks ago and we ordered a large pesto based with grilled chicken and artichokes on half (side note: If you order a topping only on half, they will still charge you the full price for that topping...Seems like price gouging to me, but whatever). This pizza ended up being $27+ tax and tip, and that was for two toppings. If any of you are interested in doing a supreme style pizza, be prepared to take out a loan to pay for it. 

Overall the pizza, service and ambiance are good, though it's overpriced in my mind. Grimaldi's is still hands down the best pizza option in Old Town, and I will almost certainly be back at some point.I must say, I do not really like thier food. 

But since they do not use any hydrogenated oils, I wanted to give them a shout out for doing it the right wayService was excellent, the view was beautiful however, the food was "eh".  Chilean sea bass was great, but they had this huge nutty crust on it that didn't add any value to the taste.  Sometimes having just clean tasting grilled sea bass is all you need.For $7 including tax during the weekday, this is a good value.  The crappy breakfast I had at the Waffle House the other morning cost more than this.

My meal included corned beef hash, french toast, sausage, sauted mushrooms and onions, along with an assortment of fruit, coffee, and orange juice.  The selection was not super extensive, but all the basics were there with a few nice extras.

The service was attentive and friendly, food decent.  There were a dozen or so regular/old-timers in the place, in addition to myself.

I must confess however, that there IS a dark side to the Hometown Buffet.  When I walked in, there was great deal of consternation over the state of the bacon -- tragically the latest batch had been overcooked. It was overly crisp, *not* tender and juicy.    The manager who greeted me informed me of this and I was assured that fresh bacon would be out shortly.   

Thereafter, I continued to hear assorted bacon-related grumblings from the old timers.   Fortunately, no full scale bacon riots erupted during the remainder of my visit.  

Do you like bacon?Aretha Franklin was right:  Chains are for fools.   Ruby Tuesday's has always sort've blown me away when it comes to how hard they try to not be a TGI Fridays clone but yet still fail miserably.   The food at Ruby Tuesday's is predictably average with service that varies from piss-poor to pretty darned good.

Most recently I enjoyed the Ruby's Minis (sliders) at the bar and the wife enjoyed a broccoli and cheese soup and the salad bar.   The soup was salty and not great but the salad bar and sliders were  yummy.   Plus, they have dos XX lager (not amber) on tap which is a rare and tasty find!

Hooray for Tuesdays on a Monday..errr..or something.Everything is like average. Like another person reviewed, I also fell in love with the Sandiego branch. Compared to that place, something missed.
However, it is located in the very good place in Tempe. 
Good place to enjoy sports and beer itself. Good place to have a group gathering. and I like their outside seats. :)Went on a Sunday for dinner and drinks. It was alright. Atmosphere was good. The food was good. I got some appetizer thing. It had the garlic fries and southwest rolls and flat bread with hummus. I was a fan. I opted for the summer season beer which the waitress described as "refreshing". She didn't mention it was as refreshing as water because it was a watered down bud light. I also tried the brownie dessert. It was dry and stale. Waitress took it off the bill. I'd go back but based on the price and everything, it wouldn't be my first choice.I'd give Pita Jungle 3.5 stars.  My wife loves this place. I enjoy the food, but not quite as much as she does.  The cost of an entree is very reasonable and you get a pretty large portion of food. I've had the chicken platter both times I've gone. The chicken was excellent, cooked well, tender and seasoned perfectly. I'm not a big fan of the beans you get with the meal, decent but not great.

The hummus and pita bread is very good. 

Service has always been very good.Had a traditional scrambled/hash browns/bacon/toast/juice breakfast and while I wasn't blown away I don't have anything negative to report.  The hash browns were really just diced potatoes that sat in the pan until browned and weren't all that flavorful, while the bacon was definitely some of the best I have ever had.  It was thick cut and full of all that bacony goodness.

Side note:  The wait staff is above average in attractiveness so if that matters to you, there you go.Been here only twice. Unfortunately I forgot what I got the first time. I remember that it was awesome though. That didn't help me the second time around.

I got the chorizo and eggs. It had more chorizo then scrambled eggs. The potatoes were my favorite. The portions were huge, but it also came with over a $9 price tag. My wife got a half stack of pancakes, which I only remember being waaayyy overpriced.

The coffee was $2.39 with unlimited refills, which tasted great.

Our waitress was attentive, friendly and hot. They seem to have new ones every semester.

Even though my portion was big, I left feeling unsatisfied and couldn't get Cracker Barrel out of my head.It's basically Trails without the guilt of funding a larger, more soulless business. They don't overcharge AS MUCH, and they have a better selection of hippie clothes, INCENSE (more than just Nag Champa!), and glassware. I'm not so sure the staff have expert opinions on their products, but at the same time I don't think the sort of clientele shuffling in really needs it.

There's a tip jar with the sole purpose of getting employees sloshed at a local brewery at the end of the month, and they openly admit this. I fully support this cause, and believe that we as a society should expand this practice. The Hippie Gypsy, with a vaguely mystic and antiquated style was a vaguely good place to shop.The place is really cute, prices were good and the service was great.  I liked the cheese bread and sausage.  Portions were huge, but the rest of the food was mediocre.  Pasta was gummy and the cream sauce was watery.  The deep dish pizza crust was good, but the cheese and sauce was really salty.  Drinks were a little light on the alcohol.  Don't think I'd go out of my way to return.The majority of my early sexual escapades were spent here, and I have bittersweet memories of this place. This location is a nice, cheap hotel in which to spend a night or two. The rooms are kept clean enough and there are a few sketchy people, but hey, it's Tempe. There's sketchy people everywhere. If you want a bed for a bargain, stay here and save some money. Who needs some fancy inn anyway?Nice looking place and friendly staff.

My only complaint would be all of the non-paying customers that come in and are allowed to stay.  Lots of street people and bums take advantage of the free air conditioning, water, and restrooms but they take up seating and stay all day.  The inappropriate conversations take away from the coffee shop environment and make me uncomfortable at times.  

Starbucks needs to crack down and offer their services to paying customers only.Fries kickass  burgers are ok.I thought this was a gay bar... Uncle Stinky Poo has been trying to convince me that it is not. 
Maybe if they lost the blacklights, wild neon colors, and the techo dance-music track from 2003, I might believe him.Thinking about going to Uno's? Here's a fun little recipe you can make yourself at home. First, you'll need some crappy  family chain-style food. Think Bennigan's. Think Chili's. Think TGI Friday's. Then, get some service. Some really, really slow service. Think snails. Think molasses. Think DMV. For the staff, drive around for a while picking up teen-agers, preferably the ones standing on street corners - the more restless and bored the better. Pile everything in a blender. Press 'puree'. Cheers.

And yet, I keep going back. Why? Aside from being close to work  and my distaste for walking long distances in the heat of summer, I like their veggie burger. It's big, it's served on an artisan challah roll, the bottom of which is lathered in guacamole (all right, so it's more avocado than guacamole, but still), and it comes with salsa. It also costs twice what it should, but hey, who's counting?C Moore's is a nice place.  The only "neighborhood" bar I know of in Tempe.  Good beer selection and some decent eats.  I'd visit it again.I can't commit myself as a huge fan of Casey Moore's just yet. While the staff there has been great when I've been, the only time I've had food there it was just OK. I've been there a few more times for drinks and they have good prices and the environment is one of a kind. I guess I'll have to stop by again soon.First, let me say that I've been an on-again, off-again member for years.  If always had good experiences with friendly staff and super clean family environment. Equipment is awesome with a huge variety.  But, why the waivering member status?????  I get bored! 

My husband signed us up again after about a year break. We keep teling ourselves that we could workout and home, then we find out it never happens!  (Sound familiar anyone?) So, back to the Y we go. I excitedly grab the class schedule and then the disappointment sets in. There are so few evening classes and not ones I'm interested in on the weekends.  My thinking is that they cater to the retirement crowd so the concentration of classes is during the day. It's great for walking on the treadmill and zoning out, but I can't do that 3 days a week. Im not a runner so treadmill running is OUT!  I need fun, aerobic classes each evening that will work around my crazy work schedule. Can I get a beginning yoga class somewhere in there? 

For now, letting membership go and depending on my fellow Yelpers to guide me to a fun workout place with dance type aerobic workouts. And maybe a bitnof Yoga tossedmin  Don't fail me Yelpers!The counter help was charismatic and makes you feel really welcome. Super sweet and genuine or is a darn good act, lol. The place was clean and well decorated but the food was ok but nothing special.Positive: a much younger crowd than the 24 closest to my home. Better people watching. 

Negative: crowdedI like to go through the drive thru, but i have eaten inside before as well. If you are inside they give you lots of chips, on the to go orders ,no. I got the green chili bean and cheese burro with rice and beans.  It is ok ,not the best. But it is very  cheap.       It is a quick meal when you are on the go.    I would rather have spicy and tasty, however i am sure i will go there again at some point.I would have rated the hotel a 2.5, but giving it a 3 for the price. Rooms are not suites, more like a motel with rooms having outdoor access. We stayed here Superbowl weekend, had a room on the first level by the pool, very noisy. Used the rooms fan to drown out the noise slightly. Can hear guests in the rooms connecting, running water for their shower. Can also here voices outside as they walk by and hang by the pool. Workers started sawing and drilling outside at 8am. Maybe the stay here is nicer when there aren't as many people here. Breakfast area is nice, but not enough seating for guests, go early or bring food back to your room. Food is adequate.

Pros: price, comfy bed, location isn't bad. Shopping across the street. WIFI.

Cons: noisy, not necessarily suites, old motel feel, slightly run down. Was a bit tricky to find, free breakfast is basic, not enough seating.This place is very very old. It can be a little bit intimidating when you first walk in ( we came in the back door). If you go in the back there is a little bit of Mexican history on the walls. Pretty neat reading all the little articles and looking at what the original cafe looked like. The lighting is dark and you feel transported to the magical year of 1980. 

Now to the real part the food! So like most Mexican restraints you start out with chips and salsa. The chips were fresh and the salsa was tasty but be warned they bring out three kinds from week to hot and they don't let you know which is which. Our waitress was on her break she was eating her dinner she stopped to wait our tables. I'm guessing they are short staffed. She took our order I got the steak machaca dinner and my woman got the taco and cheese enchilada. 

Food was brought out real fast and it was hot. I'm guessing that everything is pre made because it came out literally five minutes after we ordered it. The food taste very good. Very authentic but be warned the only difference between this place and the taco stand is you get to sit indoors and have to tip. My Machaca had so much grease there was literally a pool of oil in the bottom of my plate. We spent about 28 bucks on 2 beers and 2 dinners. 

We probably wont eat here again but its good to try once to at least eat at an original Glendale restaurant.been going here for many years.  seems a bit hit or miss with what they have in stock that morning/afternoon, and the quality, but it's always eatable :)

My favorite is the Devil Dogs and the Rainbow Cookies!!!Good food, service a little slow, a little dated and you do have to put up with a lot of whiney elderly clientele who send the waiter back for a lot of petty trivial stuff that takes away from handling other customers,  more like babysitting seniors.LAS - Ahh Las Vegas

I almost, if not always have flown in at night into Vegas, which always guarantees you awesome views of the Las Vegas strip all lit up in millions of neon lights as your plane descends into Vegas.

As soon as you step foot off your plane, you know you have arrived when you hear your first sounds of slot machines just steps away. Don't stop here, this is not the Vegas you have come for.

From your plane, depending on which airline is either a quick people mover ride or if your lucky, just a ride down an escalator to baggage claim and steps away from the taxi lines/shuttle busses ready to wisk you off to your hotel.

If your flying in solo and not in a big rush to get to the hotel, your best bet to save some $ on cab fare is to take one of the many shuttle buses outside of baggage claim. You'll pay somewhere in the range of $6-$7 per person each way taking a shuttle. Be ready to make a few stops at other hotels before reaching your own.

Wi-Fi is FREE at McCarran, always a big plus in my book, helping me pass the time while I wait to board my plane back home.I'm impressed with how quickly and nicely the security personnel processed the massive crowd through the security check point. I was equally shocked and dismayed at how much water and everything else cost at the stores next to the terminals.I've been to this airport plenty of times & I must say RENOVATION needs to take place. 

After my recent visit to Las Vegas, I had to rummage through the area to find an outlet to charge my phone. I finally found "recharge centers" by Verizon. It had a place to sit on but only for 5 people. I was lucky enough to find an open spot, but people had their laptops, phones, & other devices plugged in. People ended up crowding the area. 

The employees are nice and polite. But they seriously need to change things around, which include their eatery places.A-OK indeed.Weird layout for passenger pick up/ limo/shuttle service. It definitely feels like you're in Vegas because they have slot machines!! Lots of stores and restaurants to entertain you while you eat for your flight.Better than a 3, not quite a 4. 

The place is packed with large Island people mowing on large plates of delicious looking food. How does one NOT eat here?!

Enjoyed chicken, beef, fish combo plate. YUM! Stuffed. 

Unless you're a sumo wrestler, share a plate. If you're still hungry get another plate. These are HUGE PORTIONS!The expression, "you get what you pay for" definitely applies here. This place is pretty much a dump but cheap as hell and great if you're going with a bunch friends who are cheap haha jk. The rooms are perfectly fine, but definitely not the Venetian by any means and also don't let their pool disappoint you. 

I stayed here with 3 friends for Punk Rock Bowling in Old Town Vegas during Memorial Day weekend. I think our grand total was about $220, which is super cheap. The rooms are clean, the beds fit 2 or more people comfortably, have a flat screen tv with cable, and the restrooms are clean, what more can you ask for?!

Everyone staying here this weekend was definitely in town for Punk Rock Bowling, so if you ever come during Memorial Day weekend, brace yourself for Old Town Vegas to be even more shady then it already is haha. Basically the whole weekend was filled punk rock, punk rockers, and booze everywhere. 

All of the staff is pretty nice and attentive. They did mess up my reservation and give a 1 King bed room when there was 4 of us! As a result I was stuck in a smoking room for a night, which certainly sucked, but the problem was fixed in the morning.

Their pool is small and modest, but there was definitely some awesome pool parties there all weekend. And they let you bring in booze and sell some awesome jello shots at the bar.

The parking here is pretty limited but they have relatively affordable valet parking if need be. I definitely had a great weekend and enjoyed my stay at the Gold Spike, but overall 3.5 stars, because the smoking room thing really annoyed me. See ya next year Old Town Vegas! Punk Rock Forever!I just wanted to say that I came here while in Vegas. It is just north of the busy Strip on the way to Fremont Street. They house lots of jewelry and some hard to find vintage items. Not as large as it appears to be on TV. If you come here expecting to find something cheap, just buy one of their tourist memorabilia. It was something to do while I was visiting Vegas.I did not stay here but I came here for the Courtyard grill and buffet. It had the best deals I have ever seen in vegas. This was my first trip to vegas staying in this area and I am quite impress. Fitz is located right in the center of the old vegas strip (fremont street). And at night they have a light or movie show on the ceiling outside which is sweet... and also don't forget to do the zipline. funn..So-so...After a great dinner with the "family", we walked a few doors down to have a few drinks at Jackson's. It seems like the past few months of my life have been tolerable thanks to alcohol...and I'm not a drinker.

This is a locals Green Bay Packers bar. So, I was a little confused why there aren't any cheesehead decor in the bar but there was a harpoon of all things. This place is pretty big.

The women's restroom is quite disgusting. Only 2 stalls: regular and handicap. The regular one was filthy and I had to use 3 toilet seat covers to relieve myself and the flush didn't work! The other times I went to the bathroom, I had to use the handicap stall which was much better and cleaner.

BUUUUUT our server was fantastic. I couldn't decide what I wanted to drink so she let me try stuff and she was accurate with the description of flavor profiles of drinks. She would chat with us from time to time. However, we found it quite peculiar when she asked me if I wanted a cold glass. I want a volcanic glass that would spew hot beer please! She's still good in my book though. Magic Hat #9 and Stella Artois FTW!I love quick and easy dim sum. I went out by myself to explore the Chinatown that Vegas had to offer. After looking up some dim sum spots I decided to go with Changs. I was not disappointed nor thoroughly excited.

The variety of food definitely hit the spot. The quality was probably on par with anything I've had on the East Coast, it was authentic and well priced.

Vegas' Chinatown had nothing really going for it, but the cheap eats were delicious and great.Always delicious - never disappoints. Chicken curry is delicious (with spice from 1-10) as well as the mongolian beef. They always serve their plates with a bit of rice, which is always a plus for me (grew up in Asian food - always will love rice hehe). Delicious food.My wife and I were there for the Military bowling tournament and yes it's a casino with all the amenities needed to make it what it is..., a comfortable place to stay. Nothing great, but if your not a smoker you will be by proxy since the ventilation is woefully weak. The only other drawback was the poor service at TGIF (our orders were always messed up). One bright spot is the shuttle service to the strip and Orleans.

We will be staying there again next year since it convenient for the tournament.just an old casino with a bowling alley! and a dead easy bowling alley. shot 739 scratch with crappy carry!

has a TGI Fridays inside and a buffet that is $9.00 with players club!This movie theater is tucked away in the Palms, behind the food court. It's fully featured and very clean, with the latest modern gizmos including an  IMAX screen.

There are disco balls hanging over each theater door outside, which is a little strange, but interesting.

This is the perfect spot to duck away for a couple hours after you're tired of gambling and just want some downtime. Although you do run the risk of being informed that you are a "party fail" by your friends for doing so - that's just a risk you'll have to be willing to take!Just you average 24Hours Fitness Gym, You walk in and you forget what city your in cuz everyone looks the same.  With the 1980's color scheme.  I talk shit but i still go to 24 Hour all the time.  The 24 Hour at Silverado Ranch is the Nicest 24 Hour in Vegas.  Stay away from NorthEast Locations.Great pizza and terrible fried foods. 

So, I cannot understand the reviews of the puzzle being underdone, but the $9.99 pickup special is amazing. 
Three topping for under $10.00 and the crust is pretty spectacular. 

Now on to the fried food. 
Aside from wings, I've had the burger/fries as well as fish and chips combo. 

Based on years of experience with grocery store foods, I can tell you without hesitation the food is just frozen and refried. 

You are getting frozen fries, frozen beef and frozen fish filets so you should not expect much. 

Stick to pizza, and realize that these guys are in a rotten part of town so if they are less than super friendly just smile and they usually smile back.The first impression that I got was that the decor was beautiful and very Fung Shui!  The drinks were great but I felt that they were a bit over-priced for what they served you.  The food was pretty good and fairly priced.  Everything was served elegantly and the service was personal and friendly.  I would recommend anyone to go and experience Little Buddha.We liked the decor of Little Buddha, a crimson tinged deco palace reminding one of Shanghai in the 1930s.   The place can be casual romantic.  

We thought the sushi rolls were adequate at best (but people at  another table were in love with them - (reason we ordered).     We did order the sea bass for dinner and that was divine.  Quite good and tasty.

Nice cocktails - good time.  In a city known for many many restaurants, this place is A-OK to go to.  Its not the best In Las Vegas, but its a fun dinner out.YisssssSuper strong drinks for super cheap. They have great specials, and it seems they always have a holiday celebration of some sort. 
The bar is incredibly large too. Wasn't too smokey when I was there, but it was mid afternoon. 

When I'm, in the area this would be a place to stop again for sure!+1 star because this is where I go to get my bloody hands on Walking Dead stuff!  It's super close to my work.  I just can't give it much more than that because this Toys R Us is in the middle of what can be a rough neighborhood.  In the words of South Park's Eric Cartman, it's "In the Ghetto...In the Ghetttttooooo....."

I mean, this Toys R Us has probably seen much better days.  The outside looks so run down and 'vintage', it's so ready for a paint job.  All you can see are those little spikes on each letter of the sign, the spikes that keep the pigeons at bay.  But be careful!  There is pigeon poop galore along the front walls of the store.  Ick.

Go inside, and it's just as worn out.  The floors are dirty, the shelves look sickly, and often times the toy pegs are bare!  It's just in sad, sad shape for the most part.  This Toys R Us needs a new interior designer, and quickly!  Someone bring in that guy from that show on that network.  Yeah, that guy.  Or just bring in Candice Olson or Genevieve Gorder from HGTV or Tanya Memme from A&E to spruce up the place.  What??  Damn straight I know only the hottie female interior designers!  

Interior aside, the most important thing is that Toys R Us carries TOYS.  Lots and lots of toys.  For little kids, sure there is everything they could want usually in stock - Power Wheels, kiddie pools, slides, bicycles, Lego, Skylanders, Barbie, Hello Kitty, Justin Bieber posters, just about anything.  But for us big kids?  It's so hard to find those toys!  Especially those collector edition or 'Only at Toys R Us' big boy toys!  I can't tell you how many times I went over there on the first day a new limited edition Walking Dead toy...ahem, 'Action Figure'...should be out in stores and in stock, only to find it hasn't arrived yet!  Or it came, and some Butthead (or Beavis) hoarded the entire case!  You friggin' Ebay resellers you, tick off us actual collectors.  Leave some for me..err..us! 

Service is often an issue at this Toys R Us as well.  Sometimes this place can be barren of workers in red shirts!  You literally have to walk to the customer service stand to get a hold of an employee for help.  And on a day where there's restocking going on?  Good luck getting one of the old folks to leave their post of unboxing toys.  It can get quite irritating, especially when you're looking for someting in particular, like the new series of Walking Dead figures.  Show me the zombie!  

I'll keep coming here after work as long as they keep stocking the action figures that I really want.  Otherwise, I usually just shop at a few toy places online that cater to the big boys like me!  Toys R Us please get your act together and tidy up your store.  Oh, and stock more Walking Dead please!Dear God I have a hang over. I've been up all night playing slots and poker and I've had a blast. I hit up pizza hut & dairy queen and just about every place that sold liquor. Oh ok so ugh my huge king size bed is a plus but everything else is kind a odd everything is old looks like it needs to be remodeled. Everything smells like old molding and or musty. People who work here well u can't walk down the hall without them begging you to see a show or should u give your life away the will let u see a show for half the money. See my pictures I will add more once I wake up I'm so tired I've been up all night.I've been to the Blue Moon a number of times since they've opened and I have enjoyed every stay.  Having said that, you have to read the reviews and be informed- this is not the Bellagio.  

Pros:  staff is awesome, including John the owner.  It is clothing optional, so if you want to lay out by the pool sans Speedo, you can. The pool area and hot tub is nice. Fun when there is a group staying there or sunday bbq pool parties. Continental breakfast is free and pretty decent.  The beds are extremely comfortable.  It's quiet.  If you want to cruise, that option is available to you. Free parking close to your room. Very happy to let me do a late check out and then hang around the pool the rest of the day until my late afternoon flight.

Cons:  they are 5 minutes off the strip.  Absolutely no biggy though--it's a quick car ride or cab ride to the strip.  There is nothing within walking distance for food or anything to do (sketchy industrial-ish neighborhood), but again- a quick hop to the strip.
The price is high relative to what you can get for a nicer strip hotel--but, if you want to stay at a clothing optional resort with other gay folks, that's what you are paying for.  The room I had wasn't fabulous---the TV was like 14".  C'mon guys, you can get a 42" for $250. A lot of it is in the details though--there was a light out in the bathroom.  The shower head sprayed water all over the place.  The elevator light is one exposed light.  There is "junk" off the pool area that you can see if you go out the end exits.  Kind of looks like the money was put in up front in the rooms and then nothing much has been updated since then.  It was a bit of a ghost town, even with Hustlaball in town (I had hoped there would be an afterparty like there was 5 years ago (which i missed!)).

Would I go back?  Depends on the event and the price.  I've also stayed at a strip hotel and done a day pass for $25.I had always passed this place and wanted to check it out.  And finally I did.  I got a AAA discount so I saved like $3.00 a ticket but I think I could have gotten cheaper tickets if I had found a coupon.

What I like about this Wax Museum is that they let you get up close and personal with the figures...that being said you don't really want to get TOO close to the figures...can you imagine how many germs are on them...yikes!

It was a good size museum but they didn't have a lot of really interesting figures...especially for a place like Las Vegas.  I think this is more like a one time deal...I can't imagine that I would be back anytime soon.  Still it was a good way to spend an hour or so and I got quite a lot of photos...so it was all good!My wife dragged me here unwillingly after the poor experience that we had with wax museums in Branson. Well, this one was much better. It was fairly expensive, but there are coupons out there for it, which cuts the cost by about 20%... still kinda expensive for how short the attraction is. The wax figures were done very well, and I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. The biggest problem that I had with Madame Tussauds is the length. For the price, you aren't getting a whole lot. If they're charging $25 per person, it should be expanded by at least 50%. On the positive side, the layout of their exhibits worked really well. Overall, it was fun, and it was worth going to see once.I eaten at this firefly 3 times and still don't really understand the buzz over it.  All the food items i've tried are very decent tasting.  But i'd say the portions are too small in relation to the prices.  I would need to spend about 50 or 60 bucks to satisfy my appetite here.  I do love the outside deck and eating/drinking in the fresh springtime weather.  I'd recommend this place for drinks and snacks or if you want a small meal.I really didn't spend much time here but if you're looking for a place to sleep, Harrah's is ok. Room was decent sized as was the bathroom, but the shower/bath is standard sized. The hotel is on the older side for the strip and the room looks like it's due for an update. Bathroom fixtures were on their way out as well. The bed was ok but the sheets were on the thin side. Also, the pillows were feather, not down, so we got stabbed repeatedly by quills sticking through the pillowcase. Bring earplugs as Harrah's has an outdoor nightclub and you can hear the music blaring from downstairs if you're sensitive to noise. Fortunately, we only bathed and slept in the room (That's all I'm admitting to, anyway) so we didn't make use of any of the other amenities, but it seemed like they charge for everything except maybe the air you breathe. There wasn't any resort charge or it would have dinged them another star. The best part of Harrah's really is the location, which is very centrally located on the strip, surrounded by more upscale casinos like Caesar's Palace, the Bellagio, the Venetian, and Paris LV. If you're looking for a middling room at a middling price, Harrah's is ok. 2.5 stars, really, but I generously rounded up.The location works well if your are planning on going out quite a bit. Yes the rooms are outdated a bit, but they are clean and a decent size (got comp'd to a mini suite).

The staff is great and knowledgeable! There can be long lines around check in... but this is Vegas and it happens at all hotels. Check out was a breeze!

The casino itself is a decent size, lots of smoking going on... but that's normal as well. Overall I'd come back and recommend the Harrahs for those looking to do Vegas on low-medium budget.The shop has good prices and good deals on used guns. They stock some Sig Sauer magazines that are hard to find elsewhere in town which is a plus for me. Customer service is a bit slow. The staff is very friendly but when busy the get stretched thin. 

The range is B quality. You cannot practice head shots. The price is cheap though and it is not as crowded as other ranges in town. The staff gave a new shooter with me some personal attention as far as grip and stance. 

Summary: Good prices and some hard to find items. I hit the range there when the others are too crowded.I went here 3 years ago and I have to say I had the best ravioli I have EVER eaten.  I went back a week ago, and the service went to the dogs.  The ravioli was just ok.  Slightly disappointing.Went here on Tuesday night. The staff was very nice considering our party was over an hour late for our reservation. We had some trouble at the airport. 

The service was friendly and the restaurant is beautiful. The views of the Bellagio fountains are fabulous.

For dinner I had a salad ($12) that was pretty standard and the Ravioli dish ($25) that was good but nothing I would rave about. The wine selection is nice. Had a couple glasses of the house Pino Grigo which hit the spot. 

All in all I think  its a bit over-priced. I do realize that it's Vegas so I'm always prepared to expect to pay up the wazzooo. I just think with all the other truly awesome places on the strip I probably wouldn't go back. Unless someone else was footing the bill again.We had a good time at this restaurant recently. The chef was kind enough to prepare a schezuan style chicken dish even though it was not on the menu. Our entire order was delicious and served well. The quantity was also pretty decent and I would recommend ordering three dishes for four people. 
Expect to pay around $25 pp at this place without alcohol but with some soft drinks. There is another cheaper chinese place at Stratosphere around $15pp but Dragon Noodle Company has a much better ambience.Great service, great atmosphere, and a bar which is very great when you're waiting for a table during the busy hours!  On the other hand, the food isn't great... to me it's pretty bad.  The linguini with chopped clams was okay... the spaghetti looked and tasted like it sat under the heat lamp all day... the chicken parmegiana was dry.  My friend liked his veal marsala so I guess they can cook a steak.

The restaurant itself looks fantastic.  I love the menus and pictures on the brick walls.  They also have stories about the history of las vegas which is nice.  Oh, you also get free bread and wine... free bread and wine never tastes bad. :)

So if you want to go to the restaurant for the ambiance, then Battista's is the place to eat at.  But if you're going for the food, then maybe try somewhere else...I highly recommend the margarita sampler.  You will not be disappointed.    If you're going for Happy Hour, that's the best I can do for you, since every time I've been for HH, I get so frustrated waiting for a waitress, that I go sit a the bar or just leave.  The entrees are similar to Chili's, Chevy, or other Mex/Tex-Mex Fare.  Nothing particularly special or unique, but not bad either.My car got ran into while sitting in my parking space. Whoops. Well, to get it fixed I trusted Exoticiar Paintworks. I guess they did an okay job on the work but nothing impressive. The work looks solid but the fact that they do not take credit or debit cards is mystical in todays world. It forced me to go to the bank which I dislike! However the work looks good but not great. The inside of my car was dusty and the exterior was messy from a shoddy ca rwash given before i picked it up. They even left the service number thing inside the backseat to be discovered later. It also looked like someone riffled my center console looking for who knows what. Overall I was not impressed however in Vegas service is often bad in things like this. Hopefully the work holds up.My fella had never played Bingo so he chose Terrible's to pop his Bingo cherry. The casino isn't bad, but it is on the smaller side and smells pretty smoky. We walked in and the signage is good. We found our way to the Bingo hall quickly and got situated. Customer service wasn't the best. No one was particularly informative or helpful when we had questions. I've Bingo'd before, but never at Terrible's and my fella was newbie so we had some questions and we felt that the answers were short and not very informative, like they were cutting us off. 

Overall, the casino is ok, maybe just not my cup of tea.The food was decent, the casino was fun, but there craft beers were very good.@ Lunch buffet. Food was OK.Review #200!!!

Go once before they blow it up.  Make it quick.  I had a blast here one night with a friend.  We were a bit intoxicated and playing that "wedges ledges" game.  Do you know what I am talking about?  The game where you try to get the coins to drop off of the end and into your bucket.  Anyway, it was the most entertaining loss of $12 I have ever enjoyed.

This used to be where all the dead heads would hang out when shows were in town.  The bartenders still talk about it, and were playing some Jerry Garcia tunes while I was there.  Don't eat anything here and wash your hands when you leave.Decent selection. Pricing is high. Most of the shoes here I can find through other sources for cheaper prices.

When I was here, they were having a deal. Save $50 on two pairs and save $100 on three pairs. I really struggled trying to find a third pair worth buying (even knowing that it was effectively $50 off). The sales folks were friendly enough, a bit pushy.

Much as I hate "showrooming" this is the kind of place where it makes sense. Come try on a bunch of shoes, make notes of the models and sizes, and then buy them elsewhere.I'll second that this place was clean, and also that people at the front desk weren't friendly.  The bar was the place to be.  We didn't really patronize it - just waited for some people there (their instructions, not ours).  And waited, and waited, and waited.  So the bar staff were very nice.  And there aren't a lot of people there.  Or in this part of town.  But it is clean.My wife and I had an enjoyable stay at the Courtyard.

Actual rating comes out as a 3.5 but it's a 3 here on Yelp.Over the top pricey steakhouse in a town that has a steakhouse on every corner. Service was obsequious, almost to the point of being annoying. If one more person has asked us how we liked things "so far", my head would have melted. Amazing wine list, but overpriced, way overpriced. Entrees were well prepared and all ingredients were high quality. Beautiful, well appointed room. But it is just too damned expensive. With one of our party of four not even having an entree, and with one bottle of wine, the tab was over $500. At some point, it just doesn't make sense. But then again, we were in Vegas. What the hell.Since posting my review (which I also sent to the restaurant directly), I immediately received a response from the General Manager of the restaurant. She apologized profusely, and is currently communicating with me to better improve the service her staff provides, which is why I'm given the restaurant an additional star, as I am impressed with the speed in which they responded to my comments.I went for lunch, Foods are not that very good, but view saves it~;)Stoped by with the family for my little sister's birthday, ordered a cheeseburger and Mozzerella Sticks. The cheese sticks were huge and delicious, the burger, also very large and tasty. The have these amazing super thin shoestring fries with awesome seasoning. First time I've been to this location, usually frequent Town Square but is very comparable. Service is very consistent between the two. Large portions, good location, great service, and plenty of seating. A little bit pricey depending what you order, but overall a nice dining experience.After work one night my co-workers and I decided to stop by here for some draaaaaaaanks n' food. This was my first time here... We ordered some dranks and a BUNCH of food. No complaints, your average bar food and we are drinkin so it's allll good anyway! I never saw the bill, just threw down some money to pitch in but I think they have some good drink specials... 
We were hangin' out upstairs which I guess closes earlier than the downstairs bar which I found a LITTLE annoying but I guess we could have just moved the party downstairs, however we just called it a night then anyway. I would definitely go back for some more draaaaaanks n' food for a fun low key night!I've been wanting to try this place out for a while now and my first visit was definitely a pleasant one. The man who greeted us at the door was very polite and showed us to our table. It was such a nice day out that we decided to take advantage of the outdoor seating area. It was really nice and had plenty of shade. We couldn't come here and not try a deep dish pizza. We ordered one with pepperoni and sausage and some steak house fries as an appetizer. Everything came out great and tasted as good as it looked. I'll be back again when the mood strikes for good pizza with a good beer.I have mixed feelings about this dealership. I did get a great price on my used car, but I don't think they actually inspected my model year 2012 vehicle. This created a possible safety issue for my family. The hood shook violently as I was driving a week or so after buying the vehicle. This event happened during high-wind conditions as I was driving down the freeway. It turns out the previous owner had apparently replaced the hood and grill, but did a very poor job of replacing the parts. Only one bolt kept the hood latch secure, and only one screw kept the front grill in place. Whatever may have transpired to require a replacement of the hood and grill was not reporting in the CarFax.  I think you could argue for or against the idea that the dealership should have caught the problem, but I can say the mechanic I visited to fix it at a competing dealership noticed the problem immediately upon opening the hood. The Honda West dealership is a high-volume, low-margin operation and you can get great pricing on new and used cars compared to Findlay. I would caution every prospective buyer to pay attention to the standard dealership tactics. They will try to squeeze as much profit out of the transaction as possible. They are not your friends. The advertised price is really only an incentive to get the buyer into the showroom. The moment you decide on a car and a price they begin to wear you down with various options and fees. Don't let them do it. Stick to your plan, and be prepared to walk out. The most irritating thing about Honda West, however, is the Arbitration Agreement they try to make you sign. This is a recent trend in the industry where a dealership will try to get you to sign an agreement stating that any legal problem between you and the dealer will be heard by an arbitrator outside of the traditional legal system. Usually, in hearings like this the deck is stacked against the consumer in favor of the dealership. I absolutely refused to sign this piece of paper, and I walked out of the showroom. They flagged me down and allowed me to purchase the car without signing the agreement. If you see car at Honda West and like it, go ahead and buy it, but don't let them take advantage of you, and stick to your guns.Our journey to the Lodge started out as four couples.  Luckily the restaurant took reservations, and our table was all set and waiting for us.  Unfortunately, an incident occurred (having nothing to do with the Lodge), and before the waitress could give the orders to the kitchen, we were reduced to two couples.  I have to give props to the waitress and the manager for their patience and fortitude during this brouhaha (haha sounds funny, but it sure wasn't!). 

I needed some comfort food, so I ordered the Turkey Club, without the Club, i.e. on a roll instead of the three slices of bread, mayo on the side, provolone instead of the cheese that came with it.  It came out just as I ordered, and the roll was a hoagy roll that was much better than most. Three cheers for the avocado! I was also thrilled to be able to get a salad instead of the ever-present fries, and it was a really nice and big one.  Hubby ordered the Chicken Wrap and liked it a lot.  Of course he got the fries!

I'm not a beer drinker, so I ordered a glass of wine, and that's my biggest nit:  the wine glasses are sooooo tiny!

I'll definitely be back, but next time we'll be dining à deux.I have been to plenty of Sally's around town. This location is pretty legitimate. I would not say it is the best one in town, but it is the closest one to me. The staff gets a 6/10.

The one bad experience that I did have here was when I was looking to buy a cuticle nipper. I saw the one I wanted online, but couldn't find it in store. When I asked the male employee to assist me in finding it, he said they had two kinds and began to show me the first one. When I brought up that the one I saw online was cheaper, he immediately said that they didn't have it and didn't even bother to show me the second nipper he mentioned. Rude...

Nonetheless. Sally Beauty is a good company. Don't forget to get a Sally Beauty membership card and to sign up on the website; it is totally worth it.If you catch a good sale prices are OK but if not on sale you pay full retail!  Great selection, hard to find help, appear to be understaffed.Good food. Good service. Open 24 hours.Great value and selection... Burlington Coat factory has some amazing mark downs, but like Ross you really have to sift through the layers upon layers of clothing in order to find something worth the (discounted) price.

Overall the store is laid out in sheer madness.  The different departments intersect with the super discounts and the new items all over the store.  Alas, the designer shirts, suits, and ties for the men are neat.Gotta luv AYCE sushi for only $19.95 (and just $3 more during dinner)! They have nigiri, temaki, uramaki style sushi. It's a bit different that you order off a menu sheet & they don't bother to replace it with another order sheet (guess they don't want you to order more since it's an all you can eat).

Several disappointments: they were out of uni, when I order ama emi I expect it to be served with deep fried ebi but none came, their floors were slippery. Their dynamite is not what I expected (not enuff mayo for my taste).

Now the plusses: they have an extensive list of sushi rolls, the hamachi kama is HUGE & moist & the skin was onoliciously crispy.
I'm not a fan of wasabi or ginger but my friends luvd it.
This place  was busy for a weekday @ 2pm.I'm sorry but mediocre at best.  Jimmy johns it is.  Jersey mikes might be better too.  Turkey is carved and fresh but slightly dry so the heaping amount of cole slaw takes away from tbe dry taste.  My opinion, too much cole slaw, not enough turkey.  Nice friendly staff and quick service though, and tv in the place to watch the football games on Sunday.  Don't know how people can give 5 stars for paying 9.50 for a sandwich and drink.  Oh, bread is average at best, 
Maybe too chewy.  I had bread last night at maggianis,  that's good bread there. Dry turkey with smallish portions and too much cole slaw make it barely a 3 star.  It's a different concept of pulled turkey and I give them props for that.  Service is quick and friendly , props for that.  Just don't skimp on the best thing, the turkey. Oh, and as I was leaving, 2 people complained.  One wanted more provolone as they skimped on it, and another asked why no wheat options.The sheets were clean, flat screen tv nice, bed very comfortable, pillows nice and firm, but the carpet needs to be steam cleaned twice or just replaced. minus 2 starsTaj Palace is still my favorite although this is the only comparison I have. Mint doesnt have as many vegetarian options as Taj Palace who offers about 6 options including a salad bar. I was disappointed that Mint didnt offer any lentil dishes and the naan wasn't as great as everyone posted. My fiancé who is the meat eater wasn't too fond of the goat curry and prefers Taj Palaces chicken tiki masala. Overall, it was a good place to try for Indian food and was crowded for Saturday lunch buffet so that has to say something but we'll stick to taj palace for our Indian fix.I'm lucky that I'm able to come during a time when everyone is at work, so I can't really comment on the busy times. 

My biggest complaint? One of the check-in staff is the rudest person I've ever encountered. He never says hi, I have to ask for a towel each time, and he's just straight up impersonal, almost to the point of being hostile. Dude. If you don't like your job, get another one. Everyone else I've ever checked in with manages to make eye contact, say hello, and glance at the screen to know that I get a towel.

Other than that, I enjoy coming here because it's clean, fast, and people don't really bug you.I come to this Wendy's all the time for lunch. Its super close to work.

I frequent the drive thru, so this review is for drive thru service only.  

The staff are friendly and fast, and I have never had an order come back wrong.  No tomato, extra mayo, extra pickle, etc...they've never gotten it wrong for me.

Yesterday I tried out the grilled chicken flatbread, with the asiago and ranch.  It was really good.  Fresh greens, tomato, and it wasn't drowned in ranch dressing...just enough for some good flavor.Prices are not any better than most neighborhood grocery stores and that's really disappointing.

I like the people that work here. In fact, I think that's the only reason I go back. The neighborhood reminds me of ultra-high-density New York City or Pittsburgh, there are no-line-lot (which means different homes share one or more common walls) high density gated communities with street names like "Long Island Street" and the like nearby, and those hideous project-ghetto neo-ugly high rise buildings too. And South Point is right down the street. 

Clearly, this is one of Mr. Lee's most convenient locations, and priced accordingly. Props to Mr. Lee on motivating his employees. Even with a store full of people (usually on Friday night after 5pm and before 7pm), these employees are rock-and-roll motivated!

A little difficult to park, but not bad.Pretty basic place to stay! The room was clean but in need of upgrades for sure. It's pretty obvious all over the casino how outdated everything is. The price was cheap, and if you aren't too picky, it's worth it for an extra spontaneous night. If my son were with us, I probably wouldn't stay there. The gambling downstairs is my favorite on Fremont though! And the drink prices are awesome! I would stay here again if I were trying to penny pinch.For quick and cheap Chinese food, this isn't a bad option. A close friend of mine grew up in a household that owned several Chinese restaurants (which is funny because she is Taiwanese), so if she says this is authentic, I will take her word for it.

Food: I've only gone for the lunch special- very cheap and quite good. I usually get the Lemon Chicken special- You get soup, an egg roll, entree and rice for $5.95, much cheaper than places like Panda. I love their Egg Drop soup. I have always been a fan of Egg Drop but I love theirs the most- It's not to thick or goopy, they use the right amount of corn starch in my opinion, and they actually add seasoning flavors, so it's not just the bland chicken stock, thickener and egg. A little soy sauce and pepper on this and I am golden! The Lemon Chicken was good too- Not too sweet, tangy and plenty of the lemon sauce on the side to spoon onto my rice for a little flavor kick!

Price: Did I mention they are cheap? You cant even get a combo at McDonalds for this meager pittance any more! Great portions for the cost, and the service is fast.

All in all, if you're looking for some place quick, affordable and Chinese, this is a good one to keep in your pocket.  Great.. now I'm craving Egg Drop soup.. *grumble grumble*My boyfriend and I went here for our Valentine's Day dinner... I would say it was okay. My bf ordered the prix fix dinner they had on special that night and LOVED it- it was some sort of steak with lobster entree. But I ordered some pasta from their regular menu and was not impressed. Our waiter was very good though, so I liked the level of service. We also ordered dessert and it was fantastic, so that made up for the lackluster pasta!This is not my favorite Macayo's location in town, but it is a solid choice for a quick lunch in the area. Easy to get in, great lunch deals, good service, and a dark relaxing atmosphere. The chips and salsa are particularly good too.I am also giving a 3 stars because of the following:

PRO:
1) really cheap price ($26/nite on weekdays)
2) free unlimited access to tower is awesome.  the view is really nice, and watching drunk people jump off the tower is fun too.
3) room is decent enough for the price
4) good location (not far from new hotels on the strip)

Mehs:
1) there are lots of weird and depressed looking people here. 
2) the whole place isnt kept up.  parking lot is dirty and scary, lots of places not clean, furniture in room pretty old.  
3) area is creepy and scary. even the downtown area (which is really bad compared to new hotel areas) was a whole lot cleaner, brighter and with happier looking people.

this is a good place to stay for the first one or two nites in vegas, because the view from the tower is really beautiful and its a must see.  but other than that, better food, fun, and happier people are somewhere else.I say don't be fooled by the area that this restaurant in, because in this case, looks can really be deceiving. 

You wouldn't think a nice restaurant would exist in the area this place is in. The outside looks like it's a subpar restaurant, but when you walk in, you'll be surprised, or at least I was. 

The menu has a vast selection of Thai dishes to choose from. I was slightly bit overwhelmed, but I wanted curry, and they have a dedicated section for curry. A few seem like the same but under a different name, but I'm not very experienced with Thai food. 

I ordered the musaman curry and I admit it was tasty. I could taste the coconut and it blended really well, especially when topped on white rice. The meat reminded me of Vietnamese beef stew and it was quite delicious. It came with a few pieces of potatoes, tomatoes, and carrots. I wasn't very impressed with the amount of food I was given and my table was given. We all were surprised at the amount of food we were given with the amount the food is. The $12 curry had the portion size of something $8, but I guess when it comes to quality, you can't argue right? I wouldn't mind coming back, but this wouldn't be my first choice for Thai foodI give this place 3.5 stars. This place is way off the strip and you would probably want a car to get there. Taxi would be expensive I bet. We came here for lunch and arrived around noon and there was a line out the door. Some of the people were there for the lunch buffet and after looking at it, I didnt want to waste a meal on cheap fried stuff. The place is pretty big and we were seated with the sit down side and noticed that more people do that than buffet. Overall, the food is pretty authentic but too bad we werent able to explore more of the authentic dishes.

Garlic prawns- These bad boys are quite expensive at $22 but they are fried and yummy. I couldnt help but eat the fried shell as well. They werent spicy and did have some flavor to it but I did have a tummy ache after all the fried stuff. I say if you are a fan of seafood, then go ahead and give it a try. Since I am not an avid fan of it, I could have easily passed on it and tried an entree but my yelper self had to try.

Nam Kao Tod- This is an appetizer that Yelp told me to get. I would not reorder this. It is fried crispy rice pieces that have a sour lemon taste to it. I do not particularly like the flavor and it is not something I would ever crave. I would pass.

Tofu pad see ew- Average and nothing special about it. I liked the veggies in it though.

Mango sticky rice+ coconut ice cream- These are sold separately but they put them on the same plate. This dish is always awesome and it tastes like the others I have tried. The sticky rice isnt that sweet which is nice because you have the mangoes and ice cream with it.

Overall, it is a good Thai place in Vegas and I guess it is similar to Krung Thai in San Jose. Nothing crazy status but a good change than the regular buffet.My friend and I went into Red Square after being coerced by one of those dudes walking around saying he'd get us in free. Well I would hope so considering there was no line. I made a deal with him. He gets us in for free and give us free drink coupons. What a great deal, huh? He obliged and we went in. We ordered two drinks and realized that neither of us had any cash to tip the guy. I asked if I could tip on my card and he said no and it was ok. Very sweet guy and unfortunately I forget his name. Music was alright, nothing special.

I'll have to go back to try their food one day and explore the place a little better.The Good:  The service is top notch!  The waiter we had went all out to try to impress me.  (5 stars)
The steak.  I think if anything it was the best of all the dishes...(5 stars)
The salmon.  Pretty good eatin' but not as good as the steak!!!(4 stars)
I like the fries. Hubby didn't (he likes thin crispy fries, I like big steak fries!)  I took some of HIS fries!!!  :D

The bad: For the price, I expected better
Pork chop --  WAAAAAY too salty for me!  Took two bites and it was like SALT SALT and SALT!!!  NO WAY!!!  :(  My hubby was surprised that I sent it back, since I normally NEVER send food back... (1 star)

The ugly:  Too full to order dessert!  Wished we did, given what I see of the Yelp reviews here.

The verdict:  Meh, for the price, I expected a BAM!!!  That said, it's still pretty good food and I am willing to come back again...  Will order dessert next time and avoid the pork chop!!! 

3.5 starsI got the pre-fixe lunch menu for $29. 

Blue corn pancake with duck was great. Duck was flavorful, sauces went well. 

My pork  sandwich: The bread was too thick for the sparse filling. The sauce was spicy and pork soft but the bread tasted like cardboard. I don't know what happened there. The bread they gave us before our meals were great.

The fries were dry and tasted leathery. 

My bf ordered some lamb salad with bacon. The salad was okay but nothing exciting. (this was not part of the pre-fixe)

The dessert was a key lime pie ice cream with two cookies. I guess this was a decent dessert but a little bit plain. 

I guess seeing Bobby Flay on tv made me think that he was creative with food. I guess that's only for tv. Wish his persona on TV came out in his restaurants.Service was perfect. If you like your meats straight off the grill, piping hot-- this is not the place for you. The chefs will let the meat rest and serve it less than warm. I don't particularly like this. The pork tenderloin was almost room temperature. It's very flavorful and the sauce is great but had a gross pork aftertaste. The tamales are hit or miss as sometimes it will be moist and other times will be dry.  Newbies should try it. Blue corn pancake was okay. His breads aren't that great. Margaritas are average.Note that when you make reservations they take your cc so they can charge you $50 a head if you ditch so try not to.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect coming here, but overall it was a decent meal at a place where you're paying extra for the star power of Mr. Bobby Flay.  All sides come separately, but is usually enough to share if you want to get a few sides to share among friends.

The decor was interesting.  Lots of  bright colors and had flames all over.  The selection of drinks had a great list of tequilas to choose from.  The cuisine is Bobby Flay's famous TexMex Style.

Random note: no hats haha, I was told to take mine off.  I know it's Vegas so don't count on a hat to hide the fact that you were too lazy to spend 5 mins on your hair just because you were up till 6 am the night before.

Service was decent and friendly.  They told us our table would be ready near reservation time (8:15).  Our table was not.  Haha we waited about another 30 mins.  To be fair the place was pretty packed.

The food!
Bone-In Ribeye:
Well cooked piece of meat.  The server will tell you the house recommends Medium unless you want your steak mooing near the bone (not quite in those words).  It's a big piece of meat.  You will probably be full haha.  My friend was getting meat sweats eating the thing!  I didn't feel that the random toppings and sauces that gave it the TexMex theme were necessary.

Tuna "Nachos":
Appetizer dish.  Blue corn and Potato? Chips to handle what was basically some rough cut tuna tartar.  The tuna had some mango habanero sauce on the plate that was quite good.  The tuna itself was good, but seemed a bit bland to me.  The potato chip was flaky and seemed to be created by pressing multiple layers together.

Spinach:
Side dish.  Pretty standard sauteed spinach.

Garlic Tamale:
Small Tamale with a big pat of garlic butter in the center.  Again, good, but not amazing.  Also I was getting so full from the steak it was hard to finish off the tamale.

Overall, it's not a bad place, but with the gluttony of food in Vegas, I think you can probably do better.  Especially if all you're looking for is a good steak.I was excited to try my first Bobby Flay Restaurant. When I walked in, I was very surprised by the casual environment. I was under the impression that it was going to be a little more formal than it was. There wasn't anything extravagant about the interior, very simple. Sadly, we have been drinking the whole day and wasn't really hungry from the really late lunch we had.

We ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla and wasn't too amazed. You can definitely skip this appetizer. We then got the Blue Corn Lobster Tacos which was full of flavor and very good! A definite appetizer to get.

Due to us not being too hungry we ordered the crusted Tuna Steak. The tuna was delicious but it too wasn't something we would order again. I think we might of just ordered the wrong plates because a 9 year old boy ordered the rib eye and his dad got the NY strip steak and it looked AMAZING. The lady to my left ordered the cioppino and that too looked AMAZING.

I definitely want to check out the NY location for their brunch menu that they are well known for and try out Bobby Flay's food again... when I am not so full. Till then...I'm not gonna go crazy with this review. I had a cheeseburger and fries to go. It was good. It filled me up. It did its job. I didn't want to short change Mesa just because I didn't dine inside.I was in the area and decided to stop at the Laotian restaurant that had so many yelpers raving. 

Lunch prices were reasonable. I ordered the ginger garlic stir-fry with chicken - medium hot. A few things: a) the medium hot was pretty mild (thank goodness...I don't know what possessed me to order it medium); b) the ingredients were fresh, but I noticed that some of the vegetables, like the baby corn and mushrooms were from a can; c) the complementary appetizer (salad or eggroll) was a nice touch and added a little more dimension to the meal. 

The food was average and really nothing that I couldn't easily replicate at home. I wasn't particularly impressed, although the neighboring table left raving about their meal. Maybe I should have ordered something else?

The service was thoughtful, albeit slow, which was a disappointment because there were only three other tables occupied at the time. Really, it took an inordinate amount of time for my entree to be served. 

There are plenty of other South East Asian restaurants in the Madison area to try, so I won't be dying to come back to Lao Laan-Xang anytime soon.Burgers are good.  Service is very slow.  Two for Tuesday burgers are very small - its almost not a deal.  Eh.Eh.  For the big Irish pub on the square, this is just average.  I like the ambiance.  It is a place to sit and have a pint while chatting with friends.  It never gets too loud.  Upstairs, the couches are fun, almost Alice in Wonderland inspired.  

Prices are a bit high, but if you happen to luck out for happy hour then you are golden.  They have happy hour everyday from 10pm to close.  It is a nice place to end your day and get a deal. 

I have had their food a couple of time.  It is ok.  I am just not overly excited about this place.  They always card. ALWAYS.  Kind of annoying because I am obviously over 21 and there creates this HUGE congestion at the door.  

I do not hate this place but I do not love it.In town for homecoming weekend - Go Badgers! - our group had to try Mickie's.  We went on a Friday morning and the 6 of us waited maybe 5 minutes and were able to grab a big table, a big deal since it's seat yourself.  

The service was a little slow, but it's an old fashioned breakfast place, so it was expected.  As a vegetarian and health nut, I was so very happy to see whole grain pancakes on the menu board.  They were.....different.  Kind of like bread, thick, and huge.  I liked them though.  The boys of course tackled the Scrambler.....and didn't eat until 8pm that night because they were so stuffed.  

Overall, a cheap breakfast place near campus which us visitors enjoyed for it's individuality.A few years ago it seemed this hotel was pretty happening - not so much anymore. I stayed at a newer hotel this trip but thought I'd mosey on over and see how the blackjack tables were at NY NY. We also stopped by for dinner on a Friday night at Gallagher's and found we weren't missing anything.

Well needless to say the venture was a waste of time. The place wasn't happenin' whatsoever on a Friday night nor a late Saturday afternoon. The bj dealer was super lame and was talking to the pit boss the whole time with a pretty full table. Guess the fun dealers are down the road at Cosmo.

Just wanted to stop by and re-live the past...but as they say keep the past behind you.Love this Casino.... 

I walked around and felt as if I was walking in the streets of New York City...!

The roller coaster ride is pretty intense, you must try it at least once..!!

I love the huge arcade full of all sort of games...! It was super fun..!Hubby and lil guy went to the Star Trek Experience so I hung out at the casino. I distinctively remember doing the same thing when I was 8 months pregnant visiting Vegas with hubby and a bunch of friends and they went on the Star Trek Experience while I sat at the casino waiting for them. Well, I've never had much luck at this casino so yup, you guessed it, I lost! I got so bored waiting for them and just sat at the nickel slots (after losing on the quarter slots) and got into a rhythm of tap and tap on the slot machine while my eyes were fixated on the huge screens up top showing music videos. Eh it was okay. Not one of my favorite hotel casinos that's for sure.Haven't stayed here as the rooms were sold out, but my first impression walking in was SMOKY! 

I know that's the way all casinos are here, but it hit me like a cloudy sock of soot when I dashed in to get my Jersey Boys tix. 

There are very good restaurants here http://bit.ly/LLP2cB and http://bit.ly/LLPh7k. And a great show, too.Hotel Decor/Lobby/Eateries/Ambiance = 5/5

Hotel Room/Cleanliness=2/5.

The hotel itself is lovely. Glittering chandeliers, boisterous crowds, general amicability from the staff (April at the front desk is a 6/5), all of it lends itself to the positive hum not only of gay Paree but also buzzin' Las Vegas. BUT!

Staying at Paris was like the cursed, gradual decline of a bad relationship. Everything is platinum when you walk in, but then disappointment takes hold when you see your girlfriend without makeup for the first time (i.e. when you finally get a look at the coupon booklet you paid extra for that, turns out, is NOT worth the additional money). 

Then you find out she's a sloppy drunk (or when you are told no, there are no king-sized beds left, even though that is what you specifically booked. Are you happy with the two queens, ma'am?). 

And finally, you realize you've both gained fifteen pounds, she lost her job, and you've picked up smoking ( the room is dingy, the shower water reeks of rotten eggs -thanks, sulfur- and the tiny shampoo and conditioner are Not. Even. Worth. Stealing).

Darn you, Paris!

But....we were hardly in the room, so if you can get a deal, I'd recommend it. For the lobby. And for April. Use the coupon booklet for the buy one, get one and go see Jubilee at Bally's, and take your picture in front of the Eiffel Tower.

Enjoy!We didn't stay here but we did walk through a couple times, we really like the ambiance and the feel of being in Paris on a spring day. We ate at the cafe inside and enjoyed the atmosphere while walking around, it was warm and cheery while being on the casino floor.  The location on the strip is great, it's right in the middle of everything and walk away from everything in them middle of the strip. It's located next to Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile shopping center. These properties are part of Caesars, along with many other properties.Paris hotel has a hint of a 19th Century theme, so don't expect it to be very "modern". It's more focused on the well known Parisian elegance and opulence. It has some ups and downs, for instance; in one hand the rates are fair, the newly re-modeled rooms are very spacious and comfortable, and the staff was very friendly and helpful; at least the few I interacted with. On the other hand; the bad hand, cleanliness and upkeep is only a facade until you get to your room. In one of the stands in the room, there was a dried up fluid stain in the surface. In addition, the love-seat in the room had a 2-3 inch tear in the back rest. How long has that been there? no way to tell. The hotel seems to have a constant costumer tempo and shutting a room down for every minor repair is preposterous. However, a thorough cleaning before/after a costumer is not too much to ask, is it? and how hard is it to stitch up a  torn fabric? Because of the lack of attention to detail is why Paris deserves a border-line three our of five.I've never stayed at Paris Las Vegas but I have spent a fair amount of time gaming in there. I love the blue sky and clouds mural on the ceilings and the light effects they do to mimic day light. The casino floor is nice, but I think Paris thinks a bit too highly of themselves because their table minimums were awfully high, and their poker tourneys were set at buy-ins that were so high that they were only filling half of the field.

However, Paris does have one little thing that sets it apart from every other place on the Strip: their breakfast buffet. This breakfast spread they have, set in a Parisian village theme, is absolutely out of control. I have never in my life seen so many different options on a breakfast buffet. At $30/person, it's steep, but it is an experience you'll never forget. In the "you're not going to believe this just happened to me" Vegas-story fashion, my buddy and I are standing in this incredibly long line waiting to pay our $30 each and these two incredibly cute girls walk out of the buffet area and headed over to us. They asked us if we'd like two free coupons for the buffet; of course we took them graciously and chatted for just a minute. They had to go to the airport and weren't going to be in town to use them. They informed us we didn't have to wait in line, we could just walk in -- and walk in we did. Certain things in life are just perpetual game-changers, and Paris' breakfast buffet is one of them.

Everything you ever wanted or could dream of wanting for breakfast was there. Since that experience, it's been a tradition that every time I'm in town, I go to Paris for breakfast only. They can keep the gaming and sell that to the tourists. If I want to game, I'll go to the MGM, Rio, Caesars or the Bellagio. In fact, Paris could just close its casino as far as I'm concerned and keep the breakfast buffet open. This is also where my nickname "Bullmoose" originated, so it's been a great story to tell!Of the hotels I have stayed at in Vegas, I would rate this one as average.  Nothing spectacular.  We arrived in the morning hoping to check in early.  No such luck.  Went and had lunch and while there, I received a text my room was ready.  Went back and it was, however, the people we were with, their room was not.  And this was at almost 300 PM.  So, we all went to our room and hung out until their room was ready shortly thereafter.  Anyway.  Hung out at the pool area some, it was average.  Drink service was kinda slow, although the towel service was super friendly and the pool was nice to take a quick dip in.  Room was nice, but nothing amazing (we stayed in a Monaco Suite).  The wi-fi was painfully slow, which was annoying.  Gym was nice, but kinda small.  And various machines were broke while we were there.  The spa looked nice, but I did not get any treatments done this trip.  There was an amazing yogurt place called Yogurt In that I tried while there.  AWESOME.  Try the peanut butter.  Also ate at Diablo's, which was a fun vibe and super yummy (try the veggie burrito and chips/salsa).  We hung at Ignite one night and had an awesome time people watching.  Drinks were yummy there.  Hotel was very hard to get in and out (tons of traffic).  Weird location that was very busy on the Strip.  Anyway, if you can get a deal, stay here.  If not, there are better Suites on the Strip for sure.I've been to Vegas a few times, and after staying at a few places, I guess you could say ny expectations were high. Nonetheless, I expected our rooms at the Monte Carlo to have that "Vegas look." Wrong. The rooms looked as good if not worse than any other generic hotel, such as La Quinta. I've stayed at Hiltons that have by far better rooms than this. But I guess for the price I pay, what do I expect. No wifi was an inconvenience as well as no microwave nor fridge? I know to many its not a huge playing factor, but when you're there for a week, its nice to have food/drinks on hand without burning a hole in your pocket or having to go down to the lobby. Shitty showert that would clog and super loud flush for the toilet. Walls are thin. We heard everything and anything the people next door were doing. 

Another issue was room service. Your room service staff is very friendly BUT out of the 6 days we stayed, our room was cleaned once on the 2nd day. You best believe by the 6th it seemed like a tornado had hit. (We were only in our room to sleep and gone 80% of the day/night). I understand that at times, wed be in the room when they would come by.. but they wouldnt come back again.

The staff is very friendly though. So 3/5.

If youre on a budget, I would recommend to come here. If not, invest in a nicer hotel on the strip. I definitely won't stay here again.Monte Carlo is an old, reliable friend. We've stayed here on three separate occasions spanning eight years. As far as Strip themes go, you're not going to find much of it here. Monte Carlo is built quite simply as a moderately priced, classy hotel. Depending on your timing, it is possible to land a stay here for a very friendly price. 

Two things stand out to me whenever someone mentions the Monte Carlo: 

1) The pool. We really enjoy the pool mostly because of the lazy river. It's very relaxing, and the poolside music is among the least annoying of places we've stayed.

2) The casino. Very friendly confines and it's never difficult to sit/play wherever you want. 

Monte Carlo also has easy access out back to the neighboring casinos, so you don't have to sardine yourself down the Boulevard to get where you want to go. Anytime I'm heading to Vegas, Monte Carlo is in my top three choices for rates in the initial search. She's never let us down.There's reality and there's zumanity.  A show from Cirque Du Soleil that I would say is just average so I would say that it's pretty on par with reality if you ask me.  I think I was about to fall asleep at a couple points in the show.  Being a guy and all, I thought the "sensual side" of Cirque Du Soleil show would definitely keep me entertained and needless to say, only a couple parts of the show really kept me engaged.  That, being mostly the audience involvement.  They did a great job in making people laugh and if you are the audience participant, it will by far be an experience you will not forget.  However, doing tricks naked is not much if the tricks aren't that great.  The only performance I believe is really worth mentioning is that girl on the zumanity website with the ring which you can play by rolling your mouse over the letters "Zumanity".  Save some money that way if you want or bring a date because it mainly is a "couples" show.

Always look for promotions on the tickets.  The tickets we orignally bought were upper orchestra seats for 175$ for two and we ended up finding a promotion that we got for about 130$ for two instead.My husband and I are in town for CES, and he got us tickets for the show, after reading previous reviews we knew to keep an open mind but the people near us were not thrilled at one point. We however laughed and laughed and laughed, and when we weren't laughing we were in awe of the skill, stamina, and flexibility of these performers. There were at times, when too much was going on, and you had to decide which performers to watch, I could go again and again just to see what I KNOW I missed the first time. I walked out of there vowing to get in some more workouts, but man was it entertaining! 2 hours flew by without notice whatsoever.This is a 3 star hotel, not a 5.  Why:

-The doors slam.  This is very bad in Vegas.  Whether you sleep at 4 AM or 4 PM, you will be constantly awakened by loudly slamming doors.  It is so loud that it rattles fixtures inside your suite.

-They charge you for using the gym.  It is $40 for the day, and there is no option to just buy a 1-hour pass.  Who has time to use the gym for the entire day?

-Wifi is extra.  I'm maddened by the fact that the more expensive a hotel gets, the more they charge you for stuff that's free at the Comfort Inn.

-Crossmarketing is ubiquitous.  The elevators are stuck on a constant loop of "Big Girls Don't Cry," and then you're assaulted with the soundrack from the Phantom of the Opera upon exiting the elevator.

The upsides of the Venetian are Bouchon, it's central location on the Strip, and Barney's New York.  The prostitutes found lingering around the Venetian are much hotter than those around MGM.

Overall, this hotel, like much of Vegas, has a surface feel of elegance, but that patina is very thin.  The sheets and beds suck.  They still use those disgusting bedcoverings instead of duvets.  The towels look fancy but are thin and the same quality as the Comfort Inn.Nice suites.  I like the layout of this room. Separate step-down living room with nice furnitures. Only down fall is that the lighting is dim, especially the bathroom.
When I first walked into Venetian Casino from the Parking area, it seemed little dirty...
I wasn't impressed with the Casino until I walked into the room.  Their WiFi in the room is very spotty for the price we pay...and what's up with the cell phone connection...? It sucks.
Some Poker Dealers in the Poker Room have NO personalities.  Not too friendly, especially the ones that work late...along with the waitresses...My first trip to Vegas! And my hotel was... meh.

Nothing special about this hotel. Beautiful lobby, but there's not much that really differentiates MGM from the other Vegas hotels (except the lions... which were not out on display the entire time we were staying there). 

Rooms are average. Pillows a little on the hard side. Bathrooms are massive, but the shower heads are only high enough for a child to fit underneath. I'm 5'5" and had to squat underneath (try doing that tipsy - it's no easy feat!).

Selection of restaurants was decent. 

There was a plethora of pools, which was the best thing about MGM... no one pool was ever super crowded, so that made for a very nice day-drinking experience.

(Oh, except for Wet Republic, which had a 3-hour wait to get in, but I suspect that was because it was the pool's opening weekend and Kim Kardashian was there)

I'd maybe return to MGM, but I'd be curious to see if the other hotels had more to offer.We stayed in the older part of the hotel and the room was very dated.. the drain in the sink and the shower did not work and the most amusing part was the fact the air conditioner had 3 settings of low, medium and high, which seemed to blast cold air on every setting.... 

why 3 stars.... we really didn't spend that much time in the room and the walk to the lazy river was less than 5 min...  the casino and restaurants were great... all in all any time spent out of the room and at the casino/pool was great and well worth it!!I stayed here as a solo traveler for business one night this past week.  This was the third trip to Vegas and second time on the strip, my first stay was at Circus Circus, which I considered decent (outstanding for the vacation price Southwest gave me) but this time I wanted to try something nicer.  Everything was very nice, I checked in around 7 pm so the line was short, very friendly staff and I'm including everyone that I dealt with not just the front desk employees.  For me, finding my room on the 9th floor of the West Wing was difficult and I'm not above using my map or asking for help.  I must have looked like I knew where I was going because four or five other people asked me for directions, so I would guess this isn't an uncommon complaint.  I really liked the fact that you could get to the gym easily, the elevator marked it on the 4th floor but I wasn't able to check it out due to forgetting my teeshirt and I didn't want to spend 30 bucks on a shirt at the gift shop just to sweat in it.  I tried out the buffet, always an awkward experience when eating alone but I couldn't decide on which restaurant in the hotel I wanted to eat at and I regretted the decision. The food was decent and at (what I assume is) the correct warm/cold temp, good price so I'm not complaining but last time I had lunch at the Luxor and I feel like it was much better food and selection.    My main complaint is the hotel fee of 24.95, I understand it's for internet and other services and that ALL the other hotels charge a price as well (this is the most expensive one so far) but then I feel that the internet service should be up to par.  In my room, I got two bars it was slow enough that I ended up just using my hotspot from my phone, that's right my 3G connection to my tablet was faster than the 24.95 I paid for, basically, internet at the hotel.  The next morning I figured I would just go to the Starbucks to use the WiFi there and yet again, no service.  This time I was able to pick up on another hotels connection and it was stronger than the hotel's that I was actually staying/sitting at. Problem, oh heck yes. 

Pros:
Clean hotel
Friendly staff
Easy check in
Won 40 bucks in penny slots (lost same 40 bucks at gift shop)
On the Strip
By Monorail (I didn't use it though)
Large food/activity selection

Cons:
The creepy long mirrored hallways, really am I the only one creeped out by those?
horrid internet service
Hard to find anything at the hotel, I'm pretty sure I missed about 75% of the whole place.



The main question, would I stay here again? Answer In the future yes, if the price was right I would, I don't have that many complaints about it but I am planning my next trip to Vegas and I am certainly finding a different hotel for this next stay.MGM is a decent place to stay if you can get a good rate... Check-in/out is a waiting game, as with any other hotel on the Strip. My room was actually much nicer than I expected, and I especially loved the blackout shades. They really work!... Internet was fairly fast, the minibar selection is good, and I was fortunate to be on a quiet floor.

Their higher-end restaurants were also better than expected, except for Fiamma- blecch

Negatives included boring, often rude blackjack dealers, poor cocktail service in the blackjack area, very little shade available at the pools unless you purchase a cabana (and, you know, it's HOT in the Vegas sun... there was also very limited waitstaff working the pools), the room air conditioner couldn't keep my room cool, and huge crowds everywhere

Overall, if you like staying on the Strip, this isn't a bad place. There are better hotels, and there are certainly worse placesIt's nice, they have some great insitive that they offered us to join.  I just don't care for the montly maintenance fees after I'm done paying the money.  There are other ways to get fees out of people.  We ended up buying one somewhere else.  And although the rates are a little higher, we don't have the monthly fees for the rest of our lives.Stayed here with a buddy for free with 2 complimentary nights comped on his behalf. The hotel is the whole pirate theme but it's a step up from some places like Excalibur (which is still not a bad deal for a cheaper option stay). The room was spacious enough but parts of the room sorta didn't make sense like one side of our wall didn't have any outlets so you'd have to plug in any electronics on the opposite wall. The drain to the shower lagged. The room was stocked with plenty of towels though.  The casino seemed like a big enough place to play so I'd say its standard size for Vegas. The hotel is in close walking distance to the fashion show mall and the Wynn so that's a plus...room rates from what I saw were mid level for a strip hotel. There's also a Starbucks right outside the entrance. Not a bad place to consider for a stay.The show outside is a little disappointing. Being Vegas, the inside labyrinth is intentionally confusing. It's pretty dark and unwelcoming inside, but the pool area is nice and the Seigfried and Roy attraction is very enjoyable.I stayed here over the Labor Day weekend, and the stay was better than expected. When we first arrived we were going to valet because it's not an extra charge, just tip, but the valet was full and we just parked in the structure.  During the summer the structure can feel hotter than it is outside, so just be warned.

The rooms were clean, the room I was in had a view of the pool area, which I didn't visit because the friends I went with didn't want to go and I didn't want to go there by myself.  The rooms were a little dated, but there was a flat screen in the room to make it more modern.  I thought the beds were comfortable.  My only complaint is the lack of available electrical outlets.  There was one at the desk and maybe two more in the bathroom.  You stay with four people in the room, four cell phones (you know everyone probably has a smartphone), three plugs you do the math.

There is a monorail the takes you to the Mirage, but it's not 24 hours, it closes at 1 or 2am depending on the day.  This was not a bad stay.  For Vegas, as long as the hotel is clean, I'll be happy.I stayed here for the first time last weekend, got a room for a three day weekend for around $70... gotta love that!  Right in the middle of the strip and everything!  Everyone told me this place was going to be ghetto and that it looks like a bad Chinese gangster hideout but I was entertained by the dragons on the beams in the ceiling and the random fake celebrities... We were able to sleep eight in a room with two doubles... ghetto fab I know, but it all worked out... 

The room looks pretty much like any Harrah's style room, same bathroom, with the same toiletries, tv checkout capability, and a tiny balcony that overlooks Harrah's pool next door... 

They use the Harrah's player card in their machines since they are owned by them, you can use your comps there, they have a slightly below average buffet there, we went to the Sunday brunch variety... I enjoyed the french toast and broccoli soup they have there... other than that the eggs were gross and tasted like pure yolks and our group of 8 had to sit at two 4 seater booths back to back... Overall their food was decent quality it's just those scrambled eggs that were the problem... 

The casino was pretty decent size, they did have slots on other floors as well but I only played those that were on the main floor...  the casino was always busy whether it be the slots or the table games and the cocktail waitresses were easy to come by but I'm not sure how fast their reaction time was because I didn't order any drinks from them.  

Really, I had a great time and no complaints about the casino or the hotel and I would definitely stay here again... well comped that is =)  I wouldn't spend full price for a hotel I get for free otherwise...Food -  We ordered Onion Soup, Frisee & Warm Bacon Salad and Beef Bordelaise. 
Onion Soup - was OK but a bit on the salty side. Generous portion and definitely was not stingy on the onions. The beef stock was salty and does not have that rich buttery aroma to it.

Frisee & Warm Bacon Salad - It was light and refreshing. It was simple yet delicious. The soft-poached egg mixed nicely with the citrus vinaigrette. The portion is on the small side.

Beef Bordelaise - Steak was nicely prepared - medium rare as we have asked for. The potato chips on the side was impressive but a bit too salty to eat alone. 

Ambience - Will definitely ask for an outdoor seat next time. The lights for the indoor seating was poor and not suitable for taking "foodie" pictures :PA decent inexpensive, moderately tasty off the strip bite with ambiance. The warm goat cheese appetizer is note worthy ;DThe was nothing spectacular. It was good,  but not great. The steak frites are very good.Food was Ok, nothing too special, but what really annoyed me and my group was that our waiter was extremely rude. Also, one of the steaks arrived cold!Taste: 3
Value: 3.5
Cleanliness: 4
Atmosphere: 4
Wait time:4
Overall:3
1 being the worst, and 5 being the best



Came here with a big group( of 14) and we were some how able to get reservations, I was told this place is usually booked out a month in advance, and some how there was a drop out and we got lucky( we were trying to book about 3 weeks out)


Even though we had reservations it still took over 30 minutes to get us seated which was a bit disappointing especially when you are hungry.
They ambiance is dark lighting, semi romantic. as you walk in you dont feel like you in vegas, which is nice to get away for a second.

I order steak of course, which they are know for, the steaks are average between 25-35
I was say this was the best steak that I had for the price, most steaks under 20 dollars taste like rubber, and usually the only other steaks that I like are LB steak, Alexanders, Sage, craft steak etc, but those run you closer to 80-90 which are good too.

The steak I ordered rare and came as asked, flavors were good, tender juicy. The cut it self was pretty thin, I was expecting more of a normal cut, but for the price it cant be beat.

They also give you full sized bread baggets at the table when you sit which were nice, I used mine to soak up some of the juices from my steak.

The fried onion things that came with it were okay, not much flavor, it felt like you were eating/ tasting just air.


Over all I would come back again, at the price point the quality/ value is very good, however the wait/ reservation part is banannasBlah, I don't see what the hype is about this restaurant.  The food is tasty, and the service is adequate, but falls well short of the quality you expect from a Michelin Star quality restaurant.  Comparing Andre's to Restaurant Guy Savoy, it simply does not measure up.  If you are in Vegas, take a pass on Andre's and just go to Restaurant Guy Savoy.  Order the Guy Savoy Signature and have an awesome dining experience.  You are spending an incredible amount of money, so you should get an experience that matches the price.Basic American style coffee shop. Perhaps my opinion is tainted a bit by the fact I viewed some things about food preparation which are not generally seen by most customers. Nevertheless the breakfast was good and in copious amounts. The wait staff worked very hard at delivering the various orders as expeditiously as possible.I've stayed here twice with my friend and resident rich guy from TX.  He always gets free rooms cause he's a high roller.  I have had nothing but fun the times I've stayed here though.  It's one of the older hotels and you can tell inside.  I think it makes it classier though.  I like the style.  What can I say it's Vegas...if you want the best accommodations in town hit up the Belagio.  If you want a fun place to relax and get your gamble on then there is no better place than at the Flamingo.  You'll have fun, trust me.Le Luxor est assez grandiose mais un peu vieillissant. Casino comme on en voit partout à Vegas, il y avait un gogo-danceuse près du Lounge. 

Les scupltures dans le style égyptien et la pyramide sont vraiment à voir !

Si ce n'est ça, les boissons sont dans les prix normaux de Vegas, et l'hotel est un peu excentré par rapport aux endroits actuellement "hype" sur le Strip, mais proche du panneau "Welcome to Las Vegas".We stayed at the Mandalay bay over the weekend to get away and everything was great.  The rooms are not spectacular, it does look a little dated, but there's nothing wrong with it.  The bed was very comfy(slept like a baby), there was plenty of space compare to the newer hotels, the bathrooms were clean, flat screen tv, little table and sitting area. 

The casino area was easy access from the rooms, very important to a gambler like me, there were a variety of games, lots of blackjack tables actually, and Asian pai gow poker room which I loved.  

The restaurants were great, the buffet was so so, but overall the experience was good.  It's more like a 3 1/2 star, but since there was nothing especially memorable about the experience, I'm leaving it at 3 stars.cute enough staff, decent enough foodREALLY wanted to love this place, but i was not impressed. My husband raves about it everytime he comes home from vegas so it was one of the first reservations we made when we planned our trip. nothing exceptional but not terrible. 

have to say that their epi bread is to die for.  my favorite part of a baguette is the end (extra crusty) and providing the wheat-shaped bread/epi loaf (with multiple "ends") instead of sliced baguette or rolls is perfect. 

started with some cold mussels and the breaded bone-marrow appetizer special.  i absolutely love me some bone marrow, but when she said it was breaded and fried, it made me think twice.  i should've listened to my gut (literally) and passed on that.  almost everything is better fried, but NOT bone marrow. just say no! keep it simple and traditional. the mussels were tiny and nothing special. 

my ribeye was perfectly cooked and delicious. husband had the steak frites, his usual, but it paled in comparison to the ribeye.  obviously they are different cuts of beef, but my husband mentioned that they were having an off night.  the frites were perfect.  no dessert because we were full of frites and we didn't want to risk a hit/miss dessert.  we wanted to try bouchon bakery downstairs anyways. 

had very high hopes and expectations for our meal, but it was just ok.  i might like to try them again for brunch, but with all the other choices in vegas i most likely won't be back to bouchon. unfotunate.I was so wishing I could give this place 5 stars...a t least 4. Unfortunately I was disappointed. This was my first Thomas Keller experience and I really wanted it to be special :(

The restaurant is very classy and the service was what you'd expect from a place of this caliber. It's the food that left me disappointed. They started me off with some french bread (too hard) and warm pistachios. I had the crispy frog legs (didn't care for them too much), grilled sturgeon (a lot of flavors that didn't necessarily go together well) and profiteroles with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce (ok).

The setting was nice -- outdoor by the pool. All in all, won't be back given the options here :(For some reason I always think of Olives as a lunch spot. Had dinner her a couple of times, but lunch seems to fit better. Nice location by the Bellagio fountain, and a very pretty patio area.

Appetizers are the best thing on the menu; flat breads, beef carpaccio and (god forbid) ravioli. Somewhat uninspiring, but decent.I had one of my best meals here my first time in Vegas: Butternust Squash Ravioli with Sage and Butter Sauce. The things my brain remembers. 

Now, Olives, is just eh.Not sure what all the fuss is about. It's a medium priced for Las Vegas and very noisy dinning establishment. So loud you can't talk to the people across the table from you. My sea bass was good but not wonderful. Cold in the middle but never could get the servers attention. There was a corn pudding that was cold and smeared on the plate as what appeared to be an afterthought.  My husband said his steak was good but not wonderful. They do give you a nice basket of bread and olive spreads before. With all the restaurants in Las Vegas this is not a hit. It's like a celebrity chef gave it his name and went away and said who caresWe had breakfast there one morning and it was actually really good. Our waiter was less than enthusiastic to start but ended up being a really good guy by the time we left. Typically priced - an omelette was about $15 and it was really good. Sometimes service can be a bit slow but I will say go between the breakfast rush and the lunch rush if you can - Lines to get seated can get long...As they say, "You get what you pay for"  The $7.77 Steak Special is just that. A small side salad, and an entree of grilled shrimp skewers, a cheap quality striploin and real mashed potatoes.

Not terribly bad, not ridiculously good...just A-OK...

Kinda reminds me of the Ellis Island Sirloin Special, smaller steak but with a grilled shrimp skewer instead of an ice cold beer...ALOHA!When in Madison you have to go to the Great Dane, right?

The beer is great.  My Stone of Scone Scotch Ale was a winner.

The Dane burger was OK.  The artichoke dip on it was interesting.

If the weather is nice, try to get a seat on the outside back patio downstairs.danceclub with multiple rooms.  definitely a different feel in each. the outside area is really nice and chill.  i enjoyed hanging out there to catch some fresh air after a night of dancing.  i had a good time dancing the night away.  
word of caution though, i got pickpocketed on the dance floor. no lie! i was enjoying myself and was not keeping an eye out on my shoulder bag, which was dangling on my side.  someone reached into my purse, opened my wallet and took $80.  it was packed that night so i definitely bumping into people, which is why i didn't even realize someone had opened my purse. STUPID ME!  either way, anywhere you are, be aware of your surroundings.I have mixed feelings about the Hofbrauhaus.  It's a very social bar, but it's loud.  There is live music, and beer, and decent food.  However, the food is overpriced, and the beer is uninteresting for a craft beer geek like myself.  

We went to celebrate the departure of a coworker.  I had a glass of dunkel, and a glass of the lager.  The dunkel just didn't have enough flavor for me.  I preferred the lager.  I also had a $15 poached sausage.  For two sausages and a pretzel, it just wasn't worth it.  Sure, the imported mustard was good, but not worth the price.  In fact, for 14 people, our total bill was $750.  

I think next time we will try to go somewhere worth that kind of money to spend.  It is a fun place, that is for sure.  You can buy a shot of Jagger, and you'll get spanked along with it.  All things considered though, I would just rather go somewhere else to drink beer and have a good time with friends.So this place really had the potential of being better but I think I miust have just gone on an off day. Unfortunately probably won;t be back in AZ for a while so they may never redeem themselves in my book! 
We went for the beers and burgers and beet salad I had read so much about. First off, when we order the waiter tells us the fan is out for the night so theres no beer AT ALL.... they advertise their beer and burgers like crazy- you'd think there was a sign or someone would tell us before we were seated! 
Anyways, the beet salad I got was very good. The beets and walnuts and arugula and all that jazz were crispy and refreshing and the dressing they use is very subtle so you can really enjoy those veggies. Also had the low-carb roll... it was good, but nothing special- served me right for ordering sushi at a burger joint.
My boyfriend got the Delux burger. he LOVED it. the bun, the burger, the toppings- all of it was right up his alley and no wonder their burgers have been rated the best!Charming little place to visit and eat. They even have the sign displayed of when "Lucky You" was filmed in part there. I thought it was cool, at least. Nothing too special, other than it was the only quaint place we ate while in Vegas, which was a nice change fom buffets and restaurants. Food was decent and the prices were okay.

Be prepared to pay in cash only.Do not go on a SUNDAY if you're in a hurry. We waited in line forever and when you think you're at the front of the line you're not. Not at all. It wraps around and starts again. It is also way overrated.

The food is awesome though. You can pretty much eat anything you want here, and they have it. We stuffed ourselves silly.I love the Bellagio, but not a fan of their buffet.  I only went because I got comped the meal.  Went for a dinner on Sunday.  

I headed straight for the crab legs, and was quickly disappointed when most of them were still really cold with ice covering the meat.  

I avoided all the salad, pizza, bread, and other cheap items.   I tried to focus on mostly the more costly items.  The sushi was about average.  Good enough for a buffet, but not near good enough for decent sushi restaurant.  

Most of the meats I ate were just average as well.  If I would have ordered any of these items at a restaurant as an individual meal, I would have sent it back.  I know you can't expect great quality at a buffet, but I thought the Bellagio would have been nicer.  

Pastas and all the side dishes I tried were good.  And the desserts were pretty tasty.I can't wholeheartedly give this buffet a four-star, since I'm pretty sure the fresh shrimp I ate made me sick later on that day, but otherwise well worth the money ($23.95 for brunch on Sunday, including fountain drinks with free refills). My cousins who are locals will also vouch for this place. We went on a Sunday at exactly noon, and didn't get seated until close to one. But it was worth the wait! Really good steak, 10 different potato dishes, good mix of vegetables and tons of dessert that's well-packaged in bite-sized portions. There were a lot of different kinds of breads too, which I was unfortunately unable to make it around to tasting.Came early; so didn't have to wait long for dinner. I probably didn't eat enough to make the buffet worth it for me.  I don't even recall what I ate that night but I was impressed by the huge dessert section.My visit to here confirmed that buffeting is a young man's sport!!  They have most of the usual option and do it well.  At $50 a head, you could also get a very good meal somewhere else and not feel sick afterwards.   Just saying....We went to the Bellagio Buffet this weekend filled with memories of a super experience the last time we were in Vegas.  Perhaps it was because last time we were there for breakfast and this time we went for dinner - but it was just missing something.  Nothing I ate really struck me as delicious.  The prime rib was a bit bland and not very tender, the mashed potatoes were runny, the pastas were mediocre (the beef ravioli - blech!), the sushi was dry, and the desserts were just ok.  I ate a bunch of crab legs which were pretty good and made me feel like I didn't just throw away $40 on dinner, but overall I was let down by the experience.  I think breakfast may be the way to go here.  I will try another buffet the next time I am in Vegas.Diverse selection of food, similar to Rio ( though not quite as vast as Rio), but more conveniently located on The Strip.  The crab legs are nice here because they are pre-split so you don't have to crack them open yourself, saving you valuable minutes of gluttony time.  The food here is separated by regions, such as Italian, Mexican, Middle Eastern, etc.  Being at least a platinum Total Rewards member really helps here because the line for the more plebeian customer gets very long in a short amount of time.  In general, the quality is decent; they are going for more variety while sacrificing some quality vs. a small amount of foods that taste absolutely spectacular (as is the case with most buffets).I'm veeeeeeery picky when it comes to buffets...particularly Vegas buffets. My mind automatically raises the buffet-bar when I step off the plane and into Sin City. So with that said, The Spice Market Buffet at Plant Hollywood was ehh.

There's a decent amount of food that stretches along the entire back wall of the buffet. It was kinda inconvenient for a hungry hound like myself. I had to use my legs and feet to walk, yes WALK, from one end of the buffet to the other. But along the way I found some interesting items [during lunch] that peak my interest, some good and some not. I found it very interesting that they had a decent selection of Middle Eastern food. Not many buffets that I've had to opportunity to try never cover that part of the globe.

Overall, taste and quality of food was aight. I wasn't really impressed, but I mean it got the job done.

What I was impressed with was the desserts. They've got a crepe-making station that wasn't half bad. They've got a few different fruits to put in the crepes [strawberries, cherries, banana, etc.] and they'll even throw on some whipped cream and chocolate sauce if you're into that kinda thing. The only thing that irked me was that the fruit was drenched in a sugary syrup, or as the kids call it "sizzzzurp."

Service was okay. Our server [are they still servers at buffets??] cleaned plates in a timely fashion, told us some stories and made some small talk.

I mean SMB was okay, don't get me wrong, but for the cost and quality of everything, I'm sure there are other buffets that would be a better bang for the buck [one in particular comes to mind]. But it's worth a whirl at least once.My parents enjoyed the show. This was not my favorite cirque du soleil show I have seen but I didn't hate it...O  is still my favorite.Tao...the professional reviewers stated this place cost 25 million dollars to build.  When you first walk in to this place it is quite impressive.  The naked girls getting pruney in the bathtub with candles is a nice touch.  The giant Buddha insulting all Buddhist is quite ridiculous considering Buddha is a god in some religion put in place were debauchery is taken place at the utter most decadence.  Again, I digress.  

The place is huge with two main rooms, one is over stuff with high ceilings, and the other is over stuff with little AC, take your pick.  The music was jamming, the mixes were on point.  The crowd is your typical Vegas crowd mixed in with your "I travel in a bunch Asian Night" - p.s. I am so over that scene....yes I am Asian and I am over the whole Asian scene.  However, this place is pretty mix and we did have a good time, I would consider going back only with VIP, I am not sure how anyone could wait in that line.  It is insanely long.I don't think I'll ever understand the etiquette involved with accepting free drinks. My girl friends always try to push me into getting a free drink if they think I could. They also egg each other on to do so. My guy friends call me a gold digger if I do accept a drink.. which pisses me off because: A.) I have two jobs and I can afford my own alcohol thank you very much; B.) The same guys also offer to buy or straight out get me drinks. 

So how does the etiquette of free drinks tie in with Tao? Because I succumbed to the peer pressure of my girlfriends and accepted a decent amount of drinks. Maybe it was sheer luck that there were so many guys from UCI that night. Apparently anteaters stick together and buy each other ridiculous amounts of alcohol. I found out that night that the trash cans in the food court of the Venetian have panels that open sideways instead of at the top. Pretty hard to throw up without making a mess that way. Oh, and if you drink a lot of AMFs, your puke comes out an interesting shade of blue.

So in conclusion: tons of nice boys; crowded; beautiful settings. And run to the bathroom instead of trying to yack in a trashcan. Oh and don't listen to your girlfriends because they're evil =)Went on a night Sean Paul performed. Great dancable music and beautiful interior!  The whole experience would have been better except for:

1. Ratio was not enforced that night - it was a sausage fest and a disgustingly smelly 

2. WAY TOO CROWDED.  it really took away from the experience.  there is no dancing to be done here.  just having random people move you and shove you around for a couple hours.

if not for those 2 things i would rate this club a 5 stars hands downThis is the second time I stay at this hotel. My company booked a suite for me there. The suite is ok. You have to walk a little to gamble at Mandalay Bay. The beach is awesome and it's heated, but the lazy river is not. For some reason the lazy river is not heated and there is no tube for rent.The price isn't bad and it's a fair size buffet. I love it when they have the crab legs. The chicken is so yum, this buffet reminds me of Hometown Buffet, but a little better. The service here is good, but not great. The line are not that long as most buffets. Enjoy!I was really excited when I read about this place.  Dinner with a James Beard award winner that combines Seafood imported daily from the mediterannean?  How could you go wrong?

The view, just like everything in the Wynn is breathtaking!  Seriously, I can't think of a more descriptive word to describe it.  We sat outside under the cabana beside the koi pond.  And, it was just like being on the Capri coast.  

You can do the chef tasting menu for $140 pp or whole fish selections that range about $60 with different sauce preparations.  

I started with the parmeggiano-reggiano souffle with fresh peas and asparagus.  It was interesting, but not WOW!  I'm eating a James Beard award winner here!

I then had the linguni with clams.  It was kinda bland and lacked flavor.  I had very few clams as well.  The pasta was kinda dry too, so I don't think it was worth the $30 for the dinner portion of the pasta app dish.  

Everyone was kinda underwhelmed by the whole experience and disappointed because we thought our tastebuds were going to be tantalized but instead we were traumatized.The ambiance was nice and the servers were friendly.  The decor is very trendy and not what I would expect in a Mexican restaurant...but this is Vegas, after all.  Unfortunately, the food wasn't anything to write home about.

We weren't very hungry so only ordered the tableside guacamole,  taquitos.and a couple of mojitos.  The guacamole was doused in far too much lime juice so all we could taste was lime.  And the sundried tomatoes in it were weird - they should use regular diced tomatoes instead.  We wound up scooping some of the pico de gallo into the guacamole which helped a little bit but the lime was just too overpowering.

The taquitos were pretty good as were the mojitos.  Nothing amazing but nothing great.

It's also VERY expensive for what it is.  For our simple meal, the bill was about $50.Can I copy someone else's review?  I completely agree with Vivian.  This place is all about the view.  In fact, it's really about 3 things...

1) The view
2) Being able to brag to friends "I've been to the Ghost Bar"
3) The ride up the elevator

Other than that...eh.  First of all, the place was filthy.  The gray-ish carpet had stains all over it.  I don't know why, but that shocked me.  I remember thinking as I walked in "this is IT?".  I was actually convinced we were at the wrong bar.  The tables and chairs looked cheap and, along with the carpet and bad lighting...I was completely underwhelmed.

So, I spent my time outside.  The view was great.  And, of course, you gotta stand on the glass floor.  The angle of the walls actually kinda of did some tricks with my head for a minute, so it takes a while to get your bearing (at least, it did for me.  Or...was that the vodka?)

Anyway, been there...done that...probably won't go back.I guess I had high hopes for it, being my first Cirque show but it was actually kind of boring after a while... I guess I was expecting more stuff to go on but all they had was swimming and diving which was interesting but not as cool as a lot of commercials i have seen for other cirque shows.

It was good just not great.This is a nice show. The show doesn't really have a storyline, but it keeps you entertain with all the stunts. Nice dream like decor/settings that compliments the music. Several different type of performances from acrobats, high diving in the water to a guy on fire. Well done production and performers are amazing at what they do. I would say I am not a show type person, but if you go to one, "O" is a decent choice.This was my 3rd CDS show. I got kind of addicted after seeing "O" in Las Vegas about 2 years ago, and I hope to see more of them (next on my check list is "LOVE"). However, I would say of the 3 that I've watched, Ka was probably my least favorite. Maybe I expected too much, but I left the show a bit disappointed. 

Don't get me wrong, the rotating stage and the beautiful theatre were spectacular, but the show wasn't really what I expected after watching the other two. Since I believe this is the only CDS show with a full plot-line, I think it is much more dramatic than the other 2 that I've seen. The pre-show was all about scaring the audience, instead of making them laugh. I was missing the light-heartedness and the comedy that I have enjoyed with other CDS shows. The plot-line was a bit slow and I couldn't help but think that certain aspects of the show were just cliche. Although the performers were good, everything was focused on the plot-line, and it seemed like it jipped the audience on other aspects. I missed all of the jaw-dropping stunts and acrobatics I've seen with their other shows. The martial arts were just mediocre and I really wanted more.

That being said, my friends that went with me really did enjoy the show. For one of them, it was his 2nd CDS show, and the other 2 it was their very first. So, I guess maybe it's just because I've seen the others and now I have more to compare it to. I would just have to say that this show wasn't what I was expecting, and for that reason, I didn't really leave satisfied.

I still think that if you're going to fork over the cash to watch a CDS show in Vegas, go see "O" at the Bellagio. Even though the tickets for "O" were super expensive (especially compared to "KA", since I got the summer special for $55) and never discounted, it was worth every penny, and I would pay to go see it again. "KA" not so much...So this place should be 3.5 stars..... First of all, we went on Wednesday. We were allowed to walk right in.. No cover or wait....

The inside is nice.... Staff was ok....

I had beers... 8 bucks for a Bud....

There is no seating at all unless you get a table....

The dance floor is small but it was filled....

We might go back but I would never pay to get in.....What can I say?  Beggers can't be choosers.. it was late..  we were hungry.. we came.. we ate... we left.. and wen't back to sleep.  Where else would I go at 5 in the morning after shakin' my bootie at Tryst all night?  

It was a bit of a trek, as we had to navigate our way through the lovely canals of Venice, with the gondolas idly sitting in the waters, as if to remind us what time it was.  And, it was a little surreal... I was headed to breakfast and the sun was coming up when I really should have been going to sleep. But, then again, this is Vegas, the city that never sleeps.  

The menu was nice.. the service was okay..  We had the mashed baked potato spring rolls.. yummy...I had a chicken sandwich with a side salad that was entirely forgettable ..  I ate my friends french fries- I give them 4 stars for the ranch dressing, though.I just noticed the previous review and felt inspired to inform: It's little known, but Grand Luxe Cafe actually started as a collaboration between the Venetian and the company that owns Cheesecake Factory, because at the time they were not allowed to open another CF on the Strip (this is what I've been reliably told). 
Ironically, Grand Luxe took off and became one of the most, if not THE most successful restaurants in the original Venetian--which is why there are now two. And there's a big Grand Luxe in LA as well. And probably more elsewhere. 
I haven't eaten here in a while, but I certainly believe this restaurant fulfills the phrase "it is what it is" better than anywhere.This place... how could one not love it?! The drinks are amazing and the price is just right!! I personally recommend the "G Spot" or a martini. The food is excellent here as well. I usually get the Fez burger. I am not sure what all is on it, but I can tell you that it tastes amazing!! So why the 3 stars?... Unfortunately I woke up later that night very ill. Since this place was not the only food I had all day, I can't say for sure that I got sick from here. However, I'm hesitant to visit again now.Great atmosphere and service, however, the food left a ton to be desired. Please do not serve fish tacos with previously frozen tilapia...you may claim it is fresh, but farm raised fish seldom comes fresh and the texture showed it! Most people in Vegas are typically from somewhere in California and know what a true fish taco should be. For $16, you really ought to to put something better on the menu. If I need a spot to get a drink, this is it. If I need a spot for dinner, I am definitely going somewhere else...UPDATE - I am actually going to amend my review to a higher star due to the fact that the owner reached out to me as a result of my review and displayed a true concern over the experience. I will definitely try them again. The biggest reason? They clearly care about the level of their food and quality of the experience.First actual place on our drinking tour (post bachelorette party) of the Boulevard was Margaritaville.

We had originally wanted to sit at one of the bars, but apparently Sunday afternoons while football is on and it's beautiful outside makes for a hard time to get two spots. 

So we got classic margaritas from the small to-go bar, and wandered on our way. It was easy, fresh, quick, and the bartenders were super nice and non-Las Vegasy. 

We chatted in line with a big dude who was talking football and making our drinks extra special. Why hate on the tourist trap (because that's what the restaurant really is), when the tender pours an extra shot in each drink. Sign me up.Probably the best thing going for this place is the outdoor patio facing the Wynn fountain but even the patio has limited seating. The gelato options are not very impressive with probably only about 8 flavors compared to Espressamente Lilly next door at The Palazzo. Espressamente Lilly easily has 20 over gelato flavors so I'd take the overpass that connects the Wynn and The Palazzo and head over there. A scoop of gelato is cheaper at Sugar & Ice for $4.50. A scoop at Espressamente Lilly is a dollar more.I would give this little establishment 3.21 stars.

The good: Everything is very pleasant to the eyes, from the look of the place to all the colors of the pastries. The sweets are also very good.

The not so good: It's often crowded and there may be long lines and seating may be hard to find. The prices are also pretty high, but you have to expect that. 

I've tried a bunch of their muffins and breaded pastries, and to be honest, I feel this place is more hype than substance. Sure, it looks good, but taste wise, it's nothing special. 

The coffee I had is forgettable, especially at $4 something for an iced coffee. That, in my opinion, was the biggest rip off. You're better off getting something sweet and getting the drinks elsewhere. Actually, skip all the danishes/drinks here if you can. The sweets, like the Raspberry Tart, are what stands out here. 

Overall: It's an Anna Kournikova, it looks good, but it's not a winner. But I guess I'm a typical guy, I'm giving the stars mostly on the looks.Had stop at a buffet while in Vegas. I've tried Buffet at different hotels, this was my first time at the Wynn. Of course you can expect a pricey tag (84.00 for 2 ppl) I think we went around 4 or 5 so.. it was the dinner charge, I suppose.

Highlights: crab legs, at least 2 types, and that guy is CONSTANTLY refilling it. Good soups. Tons of Shrimp Cocktail, edamame, kim chi, spicy cucumber, rack of lamb, sushi, smoked salad, lots of different types of salads, prime rib, pastas, breads, lots of cured meats and specialty cheeses, I can go on and on. It was quite the selection, (although I focused on the crab).

Then there's the DESSERT ROOM. Yeah. you read that. not a section of the buffet line, or an area. An entire room dedicated to dessert. The were at least 8 diff types of mousses, some cream puffs, a CREPE & WAFFLE station (made fresh for you), lots of cakes, candied apples, flan, crème brulee, tarts, ice cream/gelato.. you name it. They had it. DEEEELLICIOUS.

Service was good and friendly, place was very clean and organized. Good buffet!My family and I have been coming to this restaurant for over three years now and we still love the food...I wish I could say the same about the service.  More and more frequently we have experienced absolutely horrible service.  Ranging anywhere from inattentive service to incorrect orders being served and more often less than hot.  The thing that has prompted me to finally write this though was my family's most recent visit.  Some twenty plus minutes after we ordered, I had to alert the waitress to the fact that we still not been served any of our meals (even my son's salad), while the table behind us who had arrived 5-10 minutes after that had already received there second helping of all you can eat wings.  There didn't seem to be any real reason for this since the restaurant was fairly empty (it was before 6:00pm),  We soon got our food (my son getting about a minute for his salad before our entrees came), but there was no explanation of what happened or even an apology for what happened and the food was lukewarm to boot (even though the waitress cautioned my son about how "hot' his plate was). 

I know not all the staff is so inattentive, but honestly it seems to be getting worse and worse over time.  If we could get the menu items elsewhere we likely would never return to this location...And yes, I plan on completing the 'survey' on their receipt with this same narrative!Make sure you get front row seats! We sat all the way in the back and missed out on a lot of the fun. Overall it was an OK show. With a lot of music and visual effects I just thought it would be a little bit more.....Exciting. 
We got a pass when we purchased the tickets for the Ice bar that included two entrees, two cocktails & two shots for like 30$ something bucks I thought that was pretty cool.The view is very pretty if you sent out on the patio. It's right by the Wynn's pool and I guess it could be kind of awkward watching people swim as you eat, but hey the view of the pool is pretty! The only bad thing is that there are these black birds flying over you and picking off the food leftover on the table. 

What we got:
Benedict Trio ($24): it was your choice of either pulled pork, lobster, and traditional. You could pick one of each or pick whatever of the 3 you wanted. I ended up getting one of each just so I could try them all. Eggs were cooked perfectly for each of them, once you cut into them, the yolk started flowing out. For the pulled pork...pork was kind of hard and chewy which made it hard to cut. Lobster was pretty good, but left a bad aftertaste. The traditional was bland and didn't have much flavor to it. The hollandaise sauce on it tasted bland too and didn't do the dish any justice.

Fried Chicken and Waffle ($20): I would have rather gotten this dish than any of the Benedicts. It came with a spicy maple syrup so it gave the waffle a nice kick to it with it being sweet and spicy. The chicken was perfectly fried and crunchy. I would totally get this dish again if I ever came back.

Service:
I forgot our servers name, but she was nice. She didn't come all that often and there were other people taking care of us and getting us things that we needed.This was a splurge for hubby and I's 15th wedding anniversary. We sat outside on the patio which was amazing for me, but I really love the fountains. Even though we had reservations two weeks in advance, we were told it might be about twenty minutes(we got there about 10 minutes before our reservation). Which is fine, I know there are limited seats outside and people will stay and chat. When we were first seated, it took our waiter a good five minutes to ask us what we wanted to drink. It took probably 8-10 minutes to get bread to our table.   Not a great start!  We were decided what we wanted to order and sat there for another 10 minutes or so before our waiter came back and yes, our menus were closed on the table that whole time.  Our appetizer came fairly quick but our steaks took quite a while. We had the crab cake which i thought was pretty incredible. We saw a few tables who sat down after us get their food much quicker then we did.  Whatever, though, it was our anniversary and we had a great view of the fountains. I ordered a medium 18 oz t bone steak which ended up being more rare then I would like, and hubbies medium rare porterhouse steak looked medium. Steaks were tough to cut with the knife provided but melted n your mouth. It was delicious, as was the sauces they provided.  Our water glasses never went empty and that really was the only attentive service we received.  We were asked if we wanted coffee, which I replied yes, along with a dessert menu.  We got our menus right away and it took at least 20 minutes for someone to take our order.  When the waiter took our order, it was another 20 minutes before we got our creme brulee.  The waiter simply forgot because I looked up at him when he walked by our table and the look on his face was one of oh s*&^% forgot their desert.  He did apologize and since it was our anniversary, it was complimentary.  I was in great company but the amount of tip left on our bill reflected our dissatisfaction with our service.  Our total was $192 for the crab cake appetizer, two steaks, two baked potatoes, and some coffee.  Just a warning, they do allow smoking as it is outside, which can be not so pleasant when the smoke is blowing in your direction.  We also had a rowdy group at the table next to us who were quite loud and obnoxious but I understand the restaurant wouldn't want to lose a customer.  We had to ask for our check, as did everyone around us, so I guess that is not unusual.  For the ambiance, and hubby's company it was an enjoyable evening. I loved being so close to the fountains and enjoying them go off every 15 minutes.  We never got any spray and it was a bit windy while we were there.  If we decide to go to a high end restaurant for our next anniversary, we will probably check out another place.I was not impressed by this buffet as the rest of my friends. The fish was not very fresh (and I tried 3: salmon, trout and catfish). However, I like the fact that they have many selections...like they had pho and tom yum noodle soup (and you can put your own fish balls and meat in it). The dessert bar was good though because they had many different flavors of gelato and a variety of sweets. Even though the food was ok, it's still a must try!
The service was great! The waiter even gave us a bottle of hand sanitizer to use. 
Beware: the line to get in and pay was very confusing.It has a decent selection of assorted Asian foods (it should, it's a world buffet, duh) I also like the change in between breakfast/lunch that I got for my buffet. I got to try both meals, which was neat. However,  I've just had better meals, and better buffets for that matter, in Vegas.I do like to come here, but the drinks are way overpriced. Been here many many times. Love to watch the shadow, but not sure its worth the price.Must try. The creme brulee. Fantabulous. Very creamy and flavorful. 

I'm spoiled by some great buffets... And I'd have to say this place is better than the average buffet, but truly doesn't have any unforgettable moments. Yes, it has a crepe station. But it's only average at best. Options are very simple. Choose your fruit. Choose your sauce. Second time I went, they had run out/didn't put out the nutella. Boooooo.

But it's great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Le Village doesn't go out of their way to impress you by something impressive or new-  you're sure to find familiar foods here. 

For sure, nothing bad. You'll get full. But not something I'd go out of my way for.Whats up with that darn line?? Jesus I was starving and couldn't understand why It would take 45 mins to get a table.  Beyond me but, once inside I ate I was happy, I loved the decor and the pretty things around while I ate. The food could have had more options not that amazing but, whatever I did have I was not disgusted. I loved the crepes station I guess from reading everyone's reviews that's what made me stay for the 45 min line. Its really fun how they made different crepes right in front of you. The Nutella crepes was AWESOMENESS in my stomach!Grate staff but food us not a 25.00 Buffett 

Good to the kids but then if unlike pasta then It's for you. It's a eaters pick ether you love it or hate it. I'm giving 3 out of 5Food is very good, I always order the loco moco, chicken katsu and spam musubi, but I was disappointed with their boba. I don't know if it's just the way they make boba in Hawaii but the black pearls were hard and dry and it was like they just put ice cubes and creamy coconut juice in there.great for hangovers when you do not want to drive outside the strip. it's a bit pricy, but the food comes out fast and it's pretty damn good. the service is like any other asian restaurant which is fast, rude, and kind of annoying...or i maybe saying that because every time i come here i'm realllly hungover haha.Pricey. Like most of Vegas, this place looks and smells
great. Food - it hit the spot but I won't wake up in the
middle of the night screaming Noodles Asia! like she was
some long lost hot lover I wish I had married. No. This
is the type of place you just go to because you're starving 
and just tired of walking and hey - open till 3AM. Almost
like New York! This place is right off the casino floor in 
a little corner within The Venetian. I had the Dan Dan 
Noodles. Very filling but a little dry and not as flavorful 
as I was hoping for. The service was very attentive and decent
though.It helps to know the right people.  And my friend who lives in Vegas is "right people."  Her Harrah's Diamond player's card allowed us to bypass a long line of hungry tourists and get a better table.  If I had to stand in line at Le Cafe, I would have been very unhappy.

We were seated at a big round table on the "patio."  By "patio," of course, I mean "the area of the casino floor designated for dining at Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis."  It makes me laugh every time.  They even call it "al fresco" dining on their website.  The cafe facade and the dining room do indeed remind you of old Paris, but the "patio" reminds you of that time you forgot to hit soft 17 against the dealer's 8.  That's always a no-no, by the way.

Anyway, I was craving meat, so I ordered a 20 oz. prime rib, medium rare, and a side salad.  The prime rib was around $25, and the side salad - another $3.99.  The steak came with a baked potato, but the waiter was happy to replace the baked potato with some mashed potatoes.  I got some vegetables on the plate, too.  My friend ordered their "early bird" special - filet Mignon medallions with pommes frites for only $12.99.  If I hadn't been so hungry and if I had actually liked filet, I would have totally ordered that.  What a deal.

Our entrees arrived 15 minutes later.  Her filet was indeed rare and drenched in sauce.  My prime rib was huge!  I know what a 20 oz prime rib looks like, and that was no 20 oz. steak.  The quality of the meat was definitely above average, but it was slightly overcooked.  It was a good steak, even though it was prepared medium.  I thought about sending it back, but decided against making a scene.  I was having a good time, and the steak was darn good.  The mashed potatoes and the vegetables were pretty dull and lacked flavor, seasoning and salt.

When we were done with our meal, it took us another 15 minutes to flag down our waiter.  He seemed to have gone on a break, and the other waiters had absolutely no interest in helping us.  In fact, they chose to do the easiest thing and just ignore us altogether.

Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis is a cute enough place, and I can even see paying a premium for the location and the faux ambiance.  However, do not expect a 5-star service or a 5-star meal.  Hmm, bad service and overcooked meat--maybe it IS authentic after all . . . :-)Entertaining enough for a Vegas show, but nearly naked dancing men isn't really my thing.

We bought our tickets at the half price ticket booth for an 8pm Sunday night show. The tickets were about $32 and we sat in row G - 7 rows back, but the theater is fairly small so you can still see all the dancers' faces, six packs, back dimples, etc. 

The night we went, Jeff Timmons from the boy band 98 degrees was featured in a show as an emmcee and singer. At some points during the show, i felt like i was at a teeny bopper concert.

If naked dancing men isn't really your thing, i suggest you un-sober yourself before going.  The show is pretty entertaining and involves a fair amount of audience participation.  I think about 7 or so audience members were pulled onto the stage.

Pictures with the cast after the show is $20 per person.  

Look out for Jace. He's the one with the hair and is super hot. Hubba hubba. lolthey have a heart clogging philly cheese steak  sandwich with wiz as they call it which taste damn good had the chicken philly as well not as good this place attracts alot of dudes also serve pizza and a varity of other sandwichesthis place is not for the dieters. went here for dinner tonight and left plenty full after sharing a half order of fried pickles and eating half my gumbo.
they start you out with some bisquits. (mmm buttermilk bisquits!) very soft, fluffy, and warm as soon as he sat them down on the table. they also come with apple butter. putting a bisquit onto my plate and to my surprise they are topped with sugar. let me state that i am head over heels for dessert at all hours of the day, but i just didn't care for sugared buttermilk bisquits and apple butter. i wish they left them plain. :( pout.
onto the fried pickles. i love me some southern fried pickles just not as sticks. (refer to picture.) i have never had them in the shape of a fried stick but i was let down. the fried coating was falling off and it was very messy. (not to mention greasy.) they were okay, but not something i will crave.
i go for the gumbo for the main course. i have had some good gumbo in my day and maybe that led me to be spoiled. it was spicy. i liked the sausage in it, but they didn't chop up the chicken. i had a whole chunk of chicken in my gumbo soup and a whole lotta rice. the flavoring was good and like i said spicy. even made my nose run! i sort have wish i went for something else though.
apparently everyone else in my party loved their meals including the ribs and chicken. someone else had the fried shrimp and really liked it. the servers were really nice and attentive. i feel i should give it another try if everyone else liked their meals so i will give it 3 stars for that and the lovely service we had.
i hope other people have better luck then i did.The mall itself I would call 'hoopty' even my husband commented he felt like he was in a Cancun mall. Anyways what saves this place are specific stores that I personally like, like Coach, Sketchers and Claire's. Sadly I could not find my favorite sunglasses kiosk, looks like they are gone. One problem I found is the temperature. Some parts are cool but others are hot and in the dessert heat that can be troublesome. Also some of the 'outlets' are not really that cheap, you can actually find better deals at Ross or Marshall's.We flew in late on a Monday evening and decided to swing by Yard House for some drinks and appetizers.  There weren't a lot of folks out, so it was nice to have the bar practically to ourselves. 

We kept it simple with some beer, a mojito, fried calamari, and crab cakes.  The food was not spectacular, but I suspect the venue is more about beers, sports, and a nice healthy dose of sports fan rowdiness.  I would love to see this place come alive on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.The corned beef is delicious but to get it on one of their mile high sandwiches is just silly.  I ordered one with corned beef, smoked turkey, swiss cheese and coleslaw. The individual parts were very good, but as a sandwich it ends up becoming a waste when you try to deconstruct it. 

The corned beef hash is amazing. Potato cakes are strange - they almost have a hint of sweetness which was a turn off for me. Coleslaw is delicious. French fries are on the better side of standard, but you get a gigantic plate as an order - easily enough for three people to share.

Lines are long and service is slow so be prepared.What's the difference between this Carnegie Deli and the other reviews page?

I didn't get to try this place in NYC but here in Vegas, you can get any kind of food imaginable from anywhere. Anyways we were stuffed from lunch so we picked up something to go later in the night. One sandwich could easily fill the bellies of two. But since we weren't that hungry, we ended up with some leftovers. Luckily our hotel had a mini fridge and we were able to save some for the next day. We ended up with a pastrami sandwich. I was eyeing their most famous corned beef and pastrami combo sandwich but just thinking of the size of that and at $20, I just couldn't do it. Although the plain pastrami was already $17. Sandwich was fixed up pretty quickly and we were on our way. Oh and we got a choice of breads but  stuck with the typical rye. Man the 'wich was huge. No way could the height of it fit in my mouth.  But wow, really flavorful without being too salty. And moist too. Some fat in the meat too which is bad for my health but makes it takes oh so yummy. A lot of deli's have either really salty pastrami or dry, no flavor meat. This was a good balance. It also came with the necessary (two) pickles and the pickle really helps with a different texture and taste to break up all that meat you're devouring. Wow, not sure I could part with almost 20 bucks for a sandwich all the time but this hit the spot this one time. And you should splurge every once in a while, especially on vacation.PROS: Most of the food items like the lettuce tasted fresh. They have a great variety and give you exactly what you ask for. 

the staff inside was fast and friendly, a long line was a short wait! 

They served margaritas, beer, and bottled water, just in case you're really thirsty :) and it was pretty cheap, too!

CONS: I have been to many a Chipotle, and I was a bit disappointed; they didn't give that much meat at all. Plus, the chicken was colder than normal. They scooped me too much rice and mild salsa. 

Got chips and guacamole; the guacamole had way too much onion in it, or the pieces were way too big. 

OVERALL: This chipotle was average! I know you guys can do soo much better.I have been here for dim sum a few times and it is OK.  There was nothing that really ever stood out, positively or negatively, but sometimes dim sum is just calling my name, and this is where we go.  

However, yesterday my family came to try the peking duck.  The last time I had peking duck was in Hong Kong, where the sizzling duck was carved at table side and the skin was perfectly crispy.  It was like candy.  Unfortunately, my experience at Orchids Garden was not on par.  Parts of the skin were still attached to the duck meat and only half of the pieces were crispy, while the others were limp and chewy.  The steamed bun was nice and fluffy, although a little thicker than I prefer.  But, the addition of the plum sauce and the spring onions made me forget the disappointing duck skin. 

I probably won't order it again, hence the search for delicious Peking Duck in Las Vegas continues.  This restaurant is quite clean, though.  Service is friendly, and where else can you get dim sum all day? So, I will definitely be back for that.I've wandered around the empty halls of Necropolis (that's right, my official nickname for Neonopolis is Necropolis) many times back in my hoodrat days. Neonopolis has been a Necropolis ever since the day it opened. I went to the movie theater that no one goes to once, and the movie tickets were dirt cheap(I didn't think $5 tickets for movies existed anymore) and the concession stand also had more food than usual for a movie theater lobby with french fries, pizza, mozzarella sticks, etc.... and we were the only ones in the movie theater. The movie(Meet The Browns) wasn't that good but it had to be one of the best moviegoing experiences I have ever had. 
And then you had Jillian's. It always felt so cool being able  to hang out in a bar-like environment at 14. It had a restaurant, arcade, bowling alley, pool hall, dancefloor and a stage for shows. It used to be so much fun. (And it was pretty damn easy to sneak into the psuedo-nightclub upstairs as well.)
Neonopolis really could have been a very cool place, but the execution of it was just terrible.
And I think the main reason why is because it's essentially a wall. Outdoor shopping and entertainment venues may work in California, but they don't fly in somewhere like Vegas. Put a roof over that thing!This is by far the nicest restaurant in downtown Phoenix so if you are planning a special occasion or romantic dinner, it is a great option.  The prices are steep but the food is excellent and the portion sizes are ample.  I did think that the ambiance was a bit stuffy.  I think there are much better places in Scottsdale for a fancy dinner but unfortunately not much else in downtown Phoenix.I'm hesitant to even give 3 stars. The view and concept are spectacular! It takes an hour for the restaurant to rotate completely. Don't worry! You'll see the whole thing! We still hadn't received our entrees within the first rotation....
Our service was so so. Our servers "assistant" Angela was at our table more the our server and she was great! 
Both my bf and myself ordered the 7oz filets. Very disappointed! We ordered them medium rare and they came out med well. While the steak was still decent, it was a little dry and when you pay $40.00 for a filet you should get it cooked exactly how you ordered it. Cocktails on the other hand were great!
Not sure I'd go back for the food, but may stop in for a cocktail with a view!Copper star coffee has a very warm and welcoming feel when you walk in. The owner and all of the staff members are very kind. The owner offered me a free muffin on my first time visit because he did not recognize me has a regular customer.

I enjoy coming here from time to time to get work done and the regulars there are all very friendly. This is a great place to stop in for a meeting or if you just want to work at a café.

As someone who only drinks black coffee, I do not find their regular coffee very enjoyable. It often has a bland taste and comes out boiling hot. This normally would not be a issue, however, the cups do a poor job of insulating the coffee so the drink itself changes temperatures drastically over a short period of time. Hence, the three-star rating.While the spa here is probably not as elaborate or fancy as other strip hotels, the services were great. You can't beat the prices either! I would emphasize going here over a lot of the more pricey spas along the strip. Everyone who worked here was great. I really had a relaxing morning at the IP Spa. My only suggestion would be to update the showers and hot tub area.My boyfriend and I visited this place while we were in Vegas because he loved the one in Chicago. We went in with high hopes, but we were disappointed. We had cocktail shrimp, lobster crab cake, french onion soup, the halibut special, ahi tuna, and the chocolate cake. Everything tasted bland and dry except for the soup (way too salty though)...  We loved the atmosphere, the friendly waiter (who came and refilled our lemonade and ice tea free of charge 5 times!!), and the big portion of food. But, we probably won't come back since the food is not that great... =(I have been to IKEA more times in the past two years than ANY human being should have to be subjected to. I have furnished two apartments and two offices, no thanks to IKEA. Well, mostly.

My biggest beef with IKEA is that everything is ALMOST perfect. There is always something a little off for me. Sure, I always come out of there with stuff, but I am never completely satisfied. 

I don't hate it, I don't love it. IKEA is just .... A-OK.Decent breakfast buffet. I liked the omelet station. Some stuff was fresh and others tasted like they had been out a while. But decent selection for $15. Ours was free with our hotel stay.Some friends and I came here recently for a little late lunch. It was a warm but breezy afternoon and we sat outside. I really liked the area- it's right across from Green Valley Ranch in one of those village-looking outdoor shopping centers.  This means the surroundings were pleasant to look at and there wasn't a ton of car traffic. 

I can't say I was impressed by what I ate.  I had salmon sushi and it wasn't all that. To be fair, I'm not a fan of warm sushi. Room temperature is good for me, but at least the salmon was freshly cooked, right?  I ordered a wedge salad and was sorely disappointed to the point of not even eating all of it.  Heck, I can hack a head of iceberg lettuce in half and throw some blue cheese next to it for much cheaper.  Not worth the price.  My meal was actually not memorable.  

Would I come back? I would definitely give it another try because the service was nice and the surroundings were pleasant. I'd like to try the dining room, as it looked nicely put together.  I hope the food is worth it!The Ambience here is good- techno in the backround (not too loud) and yummy Watermelon Sake make the night good.  However, the Sushi here is not up to par with what i've had (i.e. Sushi on the Rock in La Jolla, Nozomi and Mr. Sushi and Harney's in San Diego, Sen Dai in Milpitas to name a few).  I had the Spicy tuna- the flavor was not as fresh as i would have hoped, and it wasn't spicy enough.  I also had the Adobo chicken roll- the sauce was good, but the chicken was dry.  The service here is ok- the waitress was nice, but the bussers were awesome.  the sub waiter was very rude to us, saying that we ordered more drinks that we actually did.  It would have been ok, if he didin't have such an attitude about it.This is where I go for dim sum when I'm in vegas.   I would give them four stars if they had more variety.This bar is extremely high energy and makes for a fun night out if you're with a big group of people. Dueling piano players engage the crowd in sing-along numbers from Journey to The Beatles to The Rolling Stones. And everyone is usually singing by night's end. You'll see a lot of the ASU crowd here along with several birthday and bachelortte parties.The cafeteria setting was always a turn off for me but finally gave in to giving it a shot.  Salad was soso-think some of the tomatoes were bad.  But I thought the pizza and pasta were pretty good.  I would definetly go there next time a pasta craving comes around..but maybe will get it to go to avoid sitting in the uncomfortable chairs.I like choices.  I like Blu Burger Grille because, while they serve other menu options, the central concept is building your own burger which means you've got choices.

I like the idea that you can build your own burger and that "burger" can mean other things like "lamb", "turkey", "veggie" , "salmon", Kobe, etc....

The other thing I like about the Blu Burger Grille is that they serve Sweet Potato French Fries as a french fries option!  (Although - to be honest - I still think that Fez serves better Sweet Potato FF and their garlic sauce is to die for.)

I wasn't impressed with the service and the outdoor "patio" is overlooking the parking lot.  The place overall  is exactly what I've come to expect from Arizona strip mall restaurants.  

But don't let my last paragraph deter you -- on the whole - it's a kind of fun experience - the true "blu" definition of "have it your way."I have been to many taco, burritos, and carne asada fries places and this place is alright. 

First, they really need to turn down the tv in order to understand me when I give my order.  Place isn't too crowded nor too pricey.  I had to give their carne asada fries a try.. I'm a sucker when it comes to french fries.  Overall, I think that it was not too bad, but they should have put the sour cream and guacamole on the top of the meat.. It just made the fries soggy and soft.  I did give their salsa and pico de gallo sauce a try, but was too impress since it wasn't hot enough.  I believe they have another spicier sauce, but you have to ask.. I think it would be much easier for them and me if you just put it out..

Place does accept major credit cards and offer cups for water. Seating is open and it's a clean it yourself when you're done kind of place.  There is a TV and a salsa bar.  Drinks are soft self served.
Parking is pretty open since it's a huge parking lot with Vons.  

I'll def give this place another try since they have that huge 2 foot long burrito for $15.  Just have to come when I'm really hungry.I love Pei Wei Asian Diner.  I am not a big fan of this Pei Wei Asian Market concept.  It is like the diner concept, but a lot more plain.  The restaurant is smaller than the average Pei Wei, and seems to be more of a fast food atmosphere.  This location is missing the quality of the other Pei Wei restaurants.  They only offer the basic items from Pei Wei and none of the newer promotional item like the Diner Selects I was looking for.  It is missing some of the fancy touches that makes Pei Wei more desirable than Panda Express.  Food was good, but not quite what I was looking for.  If you are looking for a high quality Pei Wei, try an Asian Diner, not the Asain Market version.  Not bad to eat at, but not interesting enough to recommend.This was my first Consumer Electronics Show and I can say that I was blown away my the sheer massive size of the show. There were some great booths and many that were a waste of my time but it's shows like this that make me really giddy with excitement for the future of consumer electronics. My only mistake was to try and see everything in this show in one day. I now understand why this show is 4 days long. There's a lot of parking and you can even park for free if you don't mind walking about a block or two. I would avoid buying food in the show for suture shows because the food was way too overpriced. I will probably attend CES again in the coming years.ok so now i would give it like 3.5 stars because i went when i wasn't hungover :) .....and it was still preettty good......me and the bf shared an entrée this time because their breakfast portions are HUGE! we had the fried chicken Benedict i must say it was good ......when i saw it i thought hmm i dunno this could taste really good or really bad.....and to my pleasant surprise it was really good....we were going right before the gym so we wanted to get some carbs and protein (and be kinda bad at the same time with all the fat :) ....i also ordered a side of fresh fruit and it was fresh! ripe and juicy strawberry's crisp green apples and orange slices......our sever later brought me some watermelon slices they just cut to go along with it..... i have to give props to them for that because some places have really bad salads and fruit sides and the fact that theirs was fresh makes me think they take pride in what they serve and i can get down with that ya know......we also ordered  one snickers pancake wich was again HUGE! and we couldn't even finish it but boy was it yummy.....im totally gonna try that one at home....again our service as great as usual and we left full  and not really feeling like going to the gym llolll ;pYes! Go here when you want good food at a chill spot in the middle of Vegas. Europeans say the best way to fight a hangover is to eat greasy foods! Well, I dont get drunk enough to have hangovers, nor do I agree with everything Europeans say... nor is Hash House that greasy, so I have no idea why I said that. Onto the review.

Food - Bomb dot com

Portions, ambiance, prices and whatever else doesnt even matter with the above said food description. Well, 1 star off because of the price and inconvenient locations (i.e. they need more locations, specifically in San Gabriel Valley where I live).

I guess all that's left to talk about is the customer service. It's an American restaurant, not an Asian mom and pop, so comparably, I'd say it was pretty awesome. 'nough said.My review will strictly be on what I ordered:

The Box Combo - Shared this with a friend and it was the perfect amount.  I'll start with the chicken fingers.  Obviously freshly battered and fried which makes a huge difference in the overall quality of the product.  Moist, tender, crispy, and simply seasoned.  The Canes sauce goes heavy on the cracked pepper, which I didn't mind at all.  The fries will crinkle cut fries which I think are fitting to the type of meal that is being served.  The coleslaw was pretty standard and on the sweet side.  The toast well...... I mean who doesn't love a warm, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside thick piece of white bread with butter slathered on one side? YUM!

OVERALL:  Pretty good place for what it is.  You don't find places that focus on chicken fingers so it's a great alternative for those who aren't so much into the 93457203975209384 burger joints in this country.

Like I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!The service is slow, they take their time and there is no urgency in their service. The food is great though!So since my cousins and I were on a budget, we decided to all share our orders.  We ordered pad thai, shrimp tempura and some eggrolls.  

The pad thai wasn't anything extraordinary.  I personally like the pad thai that I've had at San Jose with many ingredients.  Tao totally skimped out on us..which brings me to the shrimp tempura. So, when we ordered the shrimp which was $8, we expected there to be at least enough shrimp for the eight of us. however, when the waiter brought out our order, it consisted of two shrimps on a tiny platter. They weren't even prawns, they were those small tiger shrimps that you can buy in bulk at your local asian store for $8 a pack! Ridiculous! We expected at least four pieces of good sized shrimp but for a tiny cocktail shrimp?? No, that was a waste of our 8 bucks.  Lastly, my favorite has to be the eggrolls. Maybe I was overcome with hunger but they tasted really good.Nice ambiance (went for a friend's birthday dinner before going out, restaurant was playing top 40 hits) Food is a bit overpriced for the quantity and quality, although the spicy tuna rolls were pretty good! If you are looking to go to dancing later, you get free admission to Tao the lounge upstairs so that's a nice bonus.If you are a sushi lover, this is an okay place to go to. They have all sorts of Japanese crusine. The food was at best mediocre and price is the typical Las Vegas Japanese joints.After 35+ yrs, I finally decided to give Sushi a try.  I told The Better Half (TBH) that I wanted to give it a shot and she suggested we come here so that I can have a good selection to choose from.  I don't eat Seatfood and have never had raw Fish until now.  TBH and my friends all love Sushi and I kind of feel bad when we have to make different plans because of me....so, here we are.

I was very nervous as we entered the joint and TBH was great because she didn't pressure me to try anything in particular.  I was starvin' like Marvin but my appetite suddenly disappeared as we walked in.  After getting setup with Ginger, Wasabi, Soy Sauce, Jalapeno Soy Sauce I browsed the Sushi buffet line.

I decided that I was going to take it slow and only try a few things....so, I went for Tuna, Salmon, Unagi, 2 rolls I have no idea what they were, Stuffed Tempura Jalapenos, Spicy Tuna Cucumber Rice thingy, and some Tempura fried Roll thingy.  Sorry I don't know the names, but took pics so I'm sure if you're a Sushi enthusiast you'll know exactly what it is.

I enjoyed the Tuna, Salmon, Unagi, & Spicy Tuna.....the other stuff I didn't care for.  I dipped it in a Soy Sauce/Wasabi mix that TBH helped me make....and it helped with the taste.  TBH told me to eat some Ginger every once in a while...which was a blast of freakin' flavor....wasn't expecting that and choked on it.  

I have no idea how to base a rating on Sushi since this was my 1st time....so to me the experience was A-OK, 3 Stars.  I wish they had labels on the Sushi, they didn't.....Overall, I enjoyed myself and will eat Sushi again.  I want to give other Seafood a try now.

Will I return?  I think so.This is for the casino only as we did not, nor have I ever stayed here:

No poker room (never have had one), cleaner than most of the casino's downtown and well maintained. We played blackjack here and won a bit so that was fun. This seems to be a place that caters to lots and lots of Hawaiian visitors who are big gamblers, so that can be fun to watch as well.

Not sure what the rooms are like upstairs but I do know they don't do reservations on the interweb.Great selection of Triple 7 house brewed beers and pretty good food, but a little bland. Great atmosphere with plenty of bar seats and tables. Will come back for sure for the beer. Will eat lunch or dinner elsewhere. This is in a not so desirable part of town, wouldn't venture here at night.  Go during the day,enjoy some really good beers and get back to the good restaurants on the strip.This was absolutely incredible. I wish I would've went in with a notepad and paper to take notes. With each specimen, there was a detailed description of it and it's purposes and functions. 
One downside is you're not allowed to take pictures. To my disappointment I can see from yelp people have taken pictures anyway, but they don't do the real exhibits any justice. 
The most powerful exhibit for me was the fetal development exhibit. It was hard to see the infant bodies, but from a scientific perspective it was breath taking. One thing I will say is that I am totally against abortion to begin with. After seeing the fetus as it develops, even in the early weeks of gestation, you can still make out a tiny human being. Just makes my stance even more rock solid.
As of recent, I learned the history of the human bodies in the exhibit. Apparently the bodies in the exhibit were purchased from China, but they come from prison inmates. The inmates didn't have a choice in the matter. Morally, I have an issue with this. In another bodies exhibit, the bodies were donated by the person for science, but these people were forced into eternal humiliation; they're naked bodies, parts, and organs are up for display for hundreds of people daily to gawk at them. It's as though they don't get to rest in peace. Just a little disturbing in my opinion.This is a cute boutique hotel - I stayed in one of the Executive Rooms for four nights - roomy with an awesome king size bed and 42" flat screen TV. Friendly staff to boot, too.

The pool area is amazing - unfortunately, I could only admire it from afar as it was too chilly to take a dip (there is a jacuzzi that they claim holds 50 people that I didn't take advantage of  - didn't bring the swim trunks).

The only issue I had was the location of the hotel - having stayed near Tempe & Scottsdale on my last visit, being in downtown Phoenix was a drag. It didn't feel like a real downtown to me and there was lots of street construction going on for their transit system. On the plus side it is near some of the gay bars (if that counts for anything).Not the best place to stay, but Karen, over in Tower 1, made all the difference in my stay.

I reserved the room on Orbitz, and after making the reservation, I called the hotel to ask if there are any extra fees, or any reason to keep cash in my bank account. The concierge said no. So, before getting on the plane over, I cashed out my account.

Now once we had gotten to the hotel, we were impressed by the look of the place and thought we had made the right choice. The ambience was hella chill. Once I checked in, I was asked to put down a $400 security deposit, and I was all like, "WTF?! I was told I don't need to do anything like that" and asked if I could just make a cash deposit. Needless to say, the answer was no.

Laurielynn and I then had to catch a cab over to the nearest Citibank to re-deposit the money we had taken out. OK, no big deal. Done. Got back to the same concierge and he said he can do with a $100 deposit, and we had put back $160. The fucker was punching in $200 in the computer, denying our card. Total fail on his part.

Now things were sucking pretty bad, but we had one awesome concierge, whom I should've gotten the name of to give a personal recommendation, that brought us to Karen in Tower 1. She was able to get us to put down only $50 for the deposit, considering I had already paid for the room in full. Thank you Karen!

After the check-in fiasco, we finally get to our room. While I thought it was going to be bigger, it was so cozy. The bed was plush and the bathroom was enormous! Half of the lights in the place are dimmable, so you can set the mood for a night of romance or a night of animal-style pow-chicka-wow-wow. The jacuzzi was huge and it had the right amount of frequency and strength. The shower was kinda weird, though. For some reason, only when I took a shower, there was only off and burn-your-ass hot. There was no happy medium there. So I always came out of the shower dry and red.

Oh, one really cool thing, at least to me, was how freaking fast the elevators were. From the time I figured out how to operate the damned thing, it took only like 5 seconds to get up to the 4th floor where our suite was.

Final verdict: 3 stars, but more like 3.5 cuz of Karen and the unnamed concierge. I would give them a shot again, but I don't think we'll be going back to Vegas anytime soon since our experience sucked, due to the people we went with/for. I think next time we go, we'll have to check out what City Center has to offer.Amazing food, beautiful patio (inside is super noisy) and the scallops are divine - I would second guess an evening there because if the service.Really nice place and good food. Happy hour is really good just a little weird the patio division for happy hour and non happy hour. And yes regular section had a more better service as far as attention. I enjoy my self just wish services was a little more attentive I got the wrong bill for my table and then my to go meal was giving to another table. but over all is a nice spot.The Beautiful Carin and I stepped out a little bit on Saturday night. I had been out of town most of the week and it was really great to get back to warm evenings and happy smiling people.
In effort to get out of my rut of thinking that I only need to go places that I can walk to, Carin and I went over to Sunnyslope and the Art Walk on Saturday evening (thanks to Christina P. for putting this up on Yelp! : )
It was really nice event and we enjoyed walking around, talking with the artists and crafts people and a couple of fellow yelpers. We were looking for something to eat. Based on several reviews and some word of mouth at the Art Walk, we were going to try Bombero's...no dice...they were at capacity and it didn't look to be getting better, so we strolled a bit farther south to Corbins.
It's a nice little place! We walked in without a reservation, and we were greeted by one of the managers (owners?) and they found us a table on the patio right away. Clearly, they were just slammed by all the people form Art Walk, but the service was really very good, esp. considering the workload (by the time we left, people were piled up waiting to get in).
It was nice warm evening, just right for a little cocktail (vodka martis) and some spinach dip (they do a nice spinach-artichoke heart dip...they crisp up their chips in the wood fired oven just before they bring the order out, so...nice touch!).
Carin had a pulled pork salad, which was inventive and tasty...barbecued pork with just hint of healthiness! I had shrimp and pesto quesadilla...pretty good and very crispy, with plenty of shrimp and great pesto flavor...but more like a pizza than a quesadilla.
We only made one mistake at Corbin's...we should have had dessert there, instead of what we chose...oh well, live and learn.
Corbins is a nice choice for good eats in Sunnyslope, esp. on the patio on a warm spring evening.Was here for brunch last weekend. We live close by so it is a great stop on the weekend while out riding bikes with the kids (pity there is not more options). The food is pretty good, however nothing special. The big guy who i think owns the place doesnt seem to warming to kids even though the place was fairly quite. Our server midlle aged silver haired lady was very friendly and looked after us. Overall we would return but mainly due to lack of options in the area for breakfast/ brunch when out riding the central canal.I am just not a huge fan of Corbin's. I am not the one to give horrible reviews but I couldnt think of anything that stood out. Why go back while there are more options in the neighborhood.
Bufallo chicken sandwich on stale bread - 3 stars.Still love this place but Pad Thai. It should be dressed with cilantro, chopped fresh green onions and chopped peanuts ( and bean sprouts) . None on this. Just some bean sprouts. And not very many so I had to ask for a little late of extra. What area of Asia is this so? And Pad Thai was 8.95 plus I asked for extra seafood which they say is extra 4 bucks. They charged us 13.95. I'm not good at math but...maybe they charged me a buck more for extra bean sprouts. You can get a  a pound at Asian market for 1 dollar... Oh well, if you dont like it, eat at home I guess!In Terminal 4, one of the few quiet sit down places to eat and quite a large seating area.  I ordered the appy sampler and they gave me extra celery since the hot wings were really hot.  Around $10.
Many more restuarants and shopping in this terminal compared to the rest.  Easy to get to Terminals with the free airport shuttle.There was only one waiter on staff the night we went, so needless to say service was pretty slow. But after reading the reviews here about the mushroom appetizer and gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce, I had to try the two. I must say they were absolutely delicious! The gnocchi just melted in my mouth! The sauce was so creamy and tasty! YUM! And the mushroom appetizer was on the money! I only give 3 stars because of the service and I tried my buddy's seafood linguine which was just OK. But he went back during lunch and said it was excellent. I will definitely go back to try more.I was intrigued by the Malaysian menu after seeing some dishes I grew up on like nasi goreng, mee goreng, beef rendang, and a variation of Indonesian soto ayam that's called Laksa on the menu. The name satay will always be synonymous with my parent's Indonesian heritage of go to dishes that's served along their killer bumbu satay (peanut sauce). So this place had a lot to live up to for me yet I will tread lightly as this is the only Malyasian establishment I know of in Vegas.
The setting is very modern and clean with ample seating. We were greeted & seated promptly by our friendly waitress.
We ordered appetizers to share and definitely wanted to try the roti canai which is a flatbread (similar to naan but greasier) and served with a curry dipping sauce. You must like curry to have this as the flavor is very intense. We enjoyed it but wish it was served with a little bit more of the flatbread to enjoy more than just a small portion of the strong curry sauce.
Next was the Korean beef jerky which was ok. The beef had good marinated bbq flavor but was a bit more chewy and not as thinly sliced as I would have liked. It came with a tangy sauce I couldn't quite figure out. The Thai sticky rice was disappointing because we expected a more glutinous sticky rice to come out. The chicken satay was pretty good and well marinated. The peanut sauce did not taste like peanut sauce as the flavor was masked in something else. It was interesting. 
We would come back to try some of the main dishes on the menu but my fear is that from my childhood going to another Indonesian family's house for dinner and it not measuring up to my mom's cooking...which I miss dearly.
At least you are doing it Satay Thai Bistro!Like others have said, its just like Chipotle.  Jack In The Box's version of Chipotle (which used to be a McDonalds company).  Someone could give me a chicken burrito made the same way at both, and I probably would not know the difference.  Chipotle's chicken has a little bit more spice, but other than that I can't see much of a difference.

They do have slightly more variety than Chipotle does in terms of the entree's you can get.  I see no point to drive out of my way to go to a Qdoba, when there are like 5 times as many Chipotle's around.Is it me or does the set up and decor remind you of a Soup Plantation? I'll leave it at that and let you come to your own conclusion about the food and service here.Excellent Ultra Lounge especially on Wednesday Night for Rocket Wednesday's Industry Night and the GO GO Dancers are amazing. Once you get inside, head towards the bar and ask for Betto. He is one of the best bartenders in Las Vegas and creator of the Flaming Donkey Cart.The WaunaQueen and I dropped by Fleming's on a Sunday evening for a glass of wine, a couple of appetizers and a great view of the sunset over the west side of Madison with a couple of former co-workers.  As mentioned in other reviews, there is a subset of items from the drink and appetizer menu available for $6 between 5pm and 7pm.

We ordered a couple glasses of the Vinedos Terranoble Sauvignon Blanc, the baked brie and the French onion soup just before the end of happy hour.  The wine came recommended by a wine blog I follow and it was the right choice for the setting and a decent value at $6 a glass.  

The baked brie was a disappointment - just brie baked in a less- than-crispy puff pastry shell.  The cheese lacked that earthy flavor and needed a boost, whether from a sauce or some added herbs.  The gala apples served with the dish started to brown by the time we received our plate.

The French onion soup ($12) also disappointed.  This dish is good test for a restaurant.  It takes time and skill to coax the natural sweetness out of the onion.  Rush the dish and it is bland, cook the onions with too much heat and they become bitter.  Cook the onions slowly at low heat and you are rewarded with a wonderful caramelization that provides deep, rich flavor.  The Fleming's version of this soup was on the bland side of the spectrum with its thin broth.  The baked gruyère and parmesan cheese topping was well executed and added a much needed punch of flavor.

Our group enjoyed the patio setting at Flemings.  Despite sitting near the bustling intersection of University and Midvale, there was very little traffic noise to interrupt our conversation.  Our server was efficient, but less than enthusiastic.  At happy hour prices, it fit the A-OK definition of a three star rating primarily due to the setting and the wine list.  Outside of happy hour, I probably will go elsewhere to find more satisfying food options.

UPDATE: After posting this review, I did get a message from the restaurant manager, apologizing that my happy hour experience with them fell short.  Her message was sincere,  appreciating that I took the time to provide feedback.  I then spoke with the manager on the phone and because of that positive interaction, I do plan on returning to Flemings.  It's a favorable sign when a restaurant uses feedback from their patrons to improve.My trip to Rao's was a bit different: my girlfriend and I were attending a wedding, and Rao's was where the newlyweds were having their reception.  If not for those circumstances, I most likely would not have eaten here.  The menu highlights: Sausage and Ricotta Pizza, Traditional Rao's Meatballs Served in Marinara Sauce, and the Caprese Salad.  Is Rao's a MUST when visiting Vegas?  Probably not.  With so much more going on in this town, Rao's is a satisfying sideshow if you crave Italia.I can't say I was blown away or anything. In terms of flavor, nothing beats "That's Amore Gelato" on Pinnacle Peak and Miller roads despite the fact that  I call them thieves for charging so much for their gelato.

There is quite a variety of flavors and you can count on paying about $ 4.00 for a small cup for which they allow you to have two flavors. There are quite a few varieties and I had the coffee with rock (spelling). At first taste, I can't say that my taste buds were overwhelmed by the quality of the ingredients. It is truly average hence a three star rating as it's truly not the best gelato I've ever had.I have been to the Vig a few times, and I I think it is hit or miss.  It is not a blow your taste bud experience and  I do think it is a tab bit overpriced for what you get.  However, for a great happy hour, drinking with friend taking advantage of Arizona weather this is  a great place.  

The atmosphere is modern but a little laid back, but then again it would have to be if you have boccie ball!  The patio is were it is at, and I think there are more tables outside then inside.  There is also an additional bar in the back.  

Food:  Overall the food is good, it is no blow your mind food but there are some strong items, I have had the following:

Apps:
Salmon plate - I really liked this
Crab and Artichoke dip - They use Crab with a C not with a K :)
Dinner:
Carne asada on a potato pancake - This is my fav dish here, bug fan of cotija cheese and gives the dish a great balance
Achiote Salmon and Chorizo Arepa - very nice spice
Steak Salad - I was actually a little disappointed with this dish, I think the salad dressing was great but the steak was overcooked and not enough cheese

I haven't tried the brunch but I am interested in what they offer.  I think that if you are looking for a chill outside bar with modern bar food the Vig is a fantastic choice.  

The valet is a bit overkill - I can walk 10 feet to a front door, I think the valet comes into play because sometimes it is hard to get a parking spot, really is a bit unnecessary but then again I guess they are creating jobs.Photos with the cocacola polar bear!Great service, great prices, nice art nouveau inspired surroundings, the fried chicken platter was tender on the inside, crispy on the outside, the prime rib special was tasty, moist, the french fries fresh and crunchy.  Wonderful selection of herbal teas, and champagne.I...really hate to say the this place has gone down lately. It seems that perhaps it was sold to a new owner? This place just isn't the same. Every time I go there are less and less unique items and more and more crafty, cutesy items. Just not my style..

I really hope their inventory improves next time I visit.American not-so superstars.  It was an okay show.  Found myself yawning a few times... but well worth the price of - free.Monday evening at 5:30p....
The streets are empty....we walk into the bar looking for a Happy Hour beer while we wait for a Yelp event to get started a few doors down.   Noticing a couple of people on the sidewalk we expected more people inside....
*crickets chirping*  [You'd hear them if it wasn't for a few of the TVs that had their volume turned up.]  The interior was welcoming and clean...but why are we the only ones here...

The bartender was rather indifferent and sauntered over like he was wishing he could be somewhere else too.  We had a leisurely beer and tabbed out....I may have to check out this place again if I find myself in the area.StripSteak is a fine steakhouse but, unfortunately, doesn't live up to the hype.

I'll start with something positive.  The ambience, to be expected, is excellent.  Good use of wood, and in an open, non-stuffy, modern way.  

They start you off with some complimentary french fries and potato bread.  The fries are gourmet (one kind is cooked in duck fat) and are good, but not great.  (In fact, I had some McDonalds fries the next afternoon which left me just as satisfied).  The bread is a bit dry.  I would never order it.

As for the drinks, I had a glenlivet 12 (can't report much there) and a cucumber martini.  The cucumber martini was perfect for a hot Vegas day (95 degrees) and was refreshing.  I also haven't been to too many places that offer a cucumber martini, so that was nice.  As for the drink itself, it was un-nuanced.  Overall, though, I'd get it again.

Onto the steaks.  I've been on a wagyu kick lately and like to compare the different restaurants that offer it, so I was glad to see they offered it here.  The price is supposedly market, so on this night, it was $185 for a 6 oz. New York.  In short, I was disappointed.  First, they serve it pre-sliced.  That pissed me off.  Pre-slicing alters the surface/area ratio, which means that each slice gets cold quickly.  I tried to return the steak to get a new one that wasn't pre-sliced, but the most they would do was "flash" the steak.  B.S.  In any event, the steak itself fell way below expectations.  Unlike CUT, the wagyu at StripSteak did not melt in my mouth and I still had to chew (ok, at CUT you do have to chew, but barely).  I would never order the wagyu here again.

I went with four other guys and none of them were impressed with their steaks (they don't even go to nice steakhouses often).  In fact, one said that the steak at Lawry's "destroyed" the steak at StripSteak.  That gives you some context.

On the other hand, StripSteak's truffled macarroni and cheese was truly divine.  In all seriousness, and forgive me for the superlatives, it was the best mac & cheese I've ever had, and by a wide margin.  For the truffled mac & cheese alone, I would go back to StripSteak.  If you go, it is a must order.

Finally, and it must be said since I'm a guy, the other reason to go to StripSteak is that one of their servers, Tori, is perhaps the prettiest girl you will ever see in real life.  I'm really not joking on that one (it was the consensus amongst the 5 guys at my table, as well as the table of 8 guys sitting next to us).  Ridiculous.

So, at the end of the day, 3 solid stars for StripSteak.  Can't say it's the best steakhouse (or even close to it), but it is a place to grab a good meal with a nice ambience and pretty scenery.Just got to Tempe and this was the spot I chose for dinner. I was tired so I called in for take-out. I ordered the lamb vindaloo pasty, a cup of leek and potato soup, and the Shirley Temple pudding. The person taking my order said the order would be ready in 20 minutes so 21 minutes later I was parking my car and heading in to pick up my food. 

Getting into the restaurant was a little confusing. I chose the door that had the restaurant name on it, but once I entered, it appeared that I came through a back entrance behind the bar area. I made my way around to what I'd consider the front of the restaurant and was guided to the pick up area. The guys were friendly and my food was ready however they had my food on a plate and not prepared for take out. I had a seat while they got it together.

I'd say my pasty was very rich, spicy and flavorful.  I'm used to pepper so I'm guessing it may be too spicy for some. The pasty was full of meat and I didn't feel slighted in the least. The soup was great, would order it again, however, they put it in a styrofoam drinking cup covered with foil, not very travel friendly.I don't know why this place have 4 stars but I guess some people like their eggs, bread and pancakes served lukewarm...

For me, this place is best at 3 stars just to be nice. 

I'm sorry for all those U.S egg fans out there but I take my breakfast seriously. My breakfast better be hot or you will get a very grump attitude from me! I thought hot breakfast should be a no brainer?? Unfortunately, I guess I have to request it to be hot and fresh out of the pan and not to expect that a place that serve solidly on breakfast should know any better. Oh I am sorry you don't serve solidly on breakfast?? Then you probably should take the word eggs out because you don't take your eggs seriously! Serve it hot or don't serve it at all!!!So. This is the next best thing to my mommy's home cooking [which is currently 500+mi away :(]. Souflaki (lamb shish kabob) was soooo good! They cooked it exactly how I asked. The fries that come with it would super good for some reason...pretty sure fries aren't a Greek specialty haha. Tiropitas (cheese pies) were pretty good. Nothing to write home about, but I'm too lazy to cook I'll definitely pop in here for a couple orders! Service was good. Casual dining but good food and reasonable prices.My hubby and I ate here last night for my birthday dinner.  I wanted to go somewhere close to our house but didn't feel like steak.  A lot of independent restaurants are closed on Mondays so that is why we had to do a chain. I am not sure if that also explains why this place was so packed.  It may also be due to the fact that they have a great prix-fix deal on Mondays where you can get almost any appetizer, entree, and dessert combination for just $37.  Not a bad deal since we both left the place absolutely stuffed to the brim and we are both big eaters.

Overall, the service at this place is really great and the food is prepared well.  I really enjoyed our visit there but I would never really become a regular since for some reason I am just not a fan of their menu.  I love seafood, but most of their dishes come with a ton of sauce or crusted or wrapped in something.  I think if you have fresh, high quality seafood then you should just let the flavor of the food shine through.  That's just me.  I did really like the taste of the wasabi sauce on my butter fish entree. I highly recommend ordering that dish. And also, their cocktails. I have sampled a few of their specialties on the drink menu and they are all quite good even if they are way overpriced.

I think Roy's is a great option for happy hour when you are looking for something a little higher class than your basic patio bar or for dinner when you feel like a taste of the islands. But I can't honestly say I'm a fan, hence the three stars.it's all about the graveyard special.  $3.99 steak and eggs!!  The steak is actually alright and the service is good.  Drunk people everywhere would like it because it's cheap and its fast.Holy douche bag central!  It's places like these is the reason why I don't frequent Scottsdale too often.  It's full of douche bags.  The hotel is a trendy hotel and people like to be seen at trendy places.  I try to avoid them, but in this case I had no choice.  The rooms are really nice, but definitely not worth the price.  I mean it's Scottsdale people, not a mega metropolis where you can get these room rates.  Try to avoid the pool at all costs because it is full of meat heads and girls who are gold diggers.  But if that's your sort of thing have at it, because I don't want it!Went to dinner last night with my husband-made reservation and off we went.....loved the entry way (guy who poked his head out the peep hole was funny) the whole atmosphere was a cool experience- the guy who walks around singing ol town songs was good entertainment-if u give him too much eye contact he will involve u in his performance so if you want privacy its best not too:)  our waitress was HORRIBLE!! She came to our table a total 3times (got drinks-took order-brought check!!)which made for a very long dinner-1 1/2hrs.....the bus boys/real waiter is who I found at end of night and handed a tip too!! 
Salad w/dinner was ok*Rigatoni Trafficante was delish I must say
Husbands 14oz Ribeye I wanted to break out a scale-NO way it was more than 9oz *mad i didnt take a picture to post.....my husband looked at me and said the garlic mashed potatoes had 0% flavor....I tasted and was sooooooo disapointed:( 
Coulnt believe they charged 39.95 for this steak !!! Bill came to over $80
And it was sooooo not worth the dough.... sorry this comment comes from a real italian who knows how to cook.....but for its good for a one time experience if you just get the pasta.....We went here for brunch and ordered the pastry basket, lobster appetizer, dungeness crab club, pancakes, bacon, apple chicken sausage, and marble potato hash.

The pastry basket was awesome with that butter and those fruit preserves.

I wish I could tell you about the lobster appetizer but it never came out.

Pancakes were nice and fluffy.

Crab club was OK.

the sides were good with the apple chicken sausage being the star.  The bacon and potatoes were OK too.

Tableau gets 3 stars just for the food.  The server seemed like she didn't want to be there and ignoring us and forgetting an order is just not acceptable for the price of the food.I really enjoy coming to this theater for a little "treat yo' self" as a fun alternative to a regular theater. We like to grab seats in the cinema suites if we can - there's nothing better than feeling like an extra in wall-e as you recline in giant red leather chairs pushing a button for someone to come wait on you as you enjoy fine theatrical entertainment. It is straight up American relaxation. 

The drinks are pretty delicious - I would suggest the electric lemonade or the southern slammer. I think my only complaint is the food. For $12 chicken fingers, I would expect more than pre-formed frozen chicken strips that I could get in a high school cafeteria. But I will forgive the chicken strips. Because lounging in those comfy chairs instead of praying someone doesn't sit in front of me in a regular theater with a drink in my hand is totally worth the extra $5 in my world.good atmosphere whether you like sports or family dining. the bar area is somewhat separated from the restaurant. the pizza is a good flavor with quality sauce and toppings, but the pizza is much smaller then it should be. ordered a large with toppings for $23. this was a smaller medium size at best. very thin crust.  chicken parm.  was very good. appetizers are fine. i compare them to applebees. happy hour is very good with cheap drink prices and reduced price appetizers. good place to catch a game. lots of big tvs.All of these casinos start to run together after awhile. But Caesar's does have one of the biggest gaming floors I remember seeing in Vegas.

A good a place as any on the strip to throw away your money!Menu selection is quite extensive here.  If you're an indecisive person when it comes to food, this is not the place for you.  I think the waffles and the pancakes are the items to try here.  We tried two french toasts (apple cinnamon and the classic).  Both were so so.  But those that ordered the pancakes and the waffles seemed to be pleased with their selections.  The egg entrees were ok.  The jambalya egg dish was primarily egg and hardly any filling.  The southwester omlette was quite tasty.  As for portion sizes, most were pretty substantial. Now looking back, I wish I tried the apple pancake that takes 30 minutes to make.  That looked really good.

This place is very packed so be prepared to wait.  Not a bad place for a hearty, no frills meal.The correct address is 1650 S. Gilbert, Gilbert, AZ 85295. I did like the pork ribs but didn't think they were the best in the valley. It looks like there is a dry rub on the ribs but I couldn't taste it. The ribs are black and look crusty but there is no taste of any spices. The sauces are good and are needed. I have eaten some ribs with a really good dry rub that needs nothing else. I would rate the ribs average. There is a choice of 2 kinds of beans, I had the one with sausage in it, pretty good. The peach cobbler was good too.Was in town for work and met a friend that lived nearby here for a beer, with one of the main reasons being they had a Golden Tee machine. Well, they served beer (albeit a limited selection) and the machine worked (unlike the pinball machine next to it) so I guess it served its purpose? Nothing to write home about though, the outdoor patio seemed like it could be pretty cool to hang out and the dedicated cornhole space was a nice touch, but all in all, just a dive bar.Though not my top choice, my family and friends love this place mostly for it's healthy food image.  I do find myself here at least once a week and I recommend the chopped salad.  Others have recommended the haddock sandwich and butternut squash ravioli.  It is also kid friendly and have great selections for kids such as pasta and fresh fruit.Cute place, minuscule parking lot.  Had a turkey wrap, which was on the small side compared to most wraps I've had, but it was plenty filling enough for me (a little skimpy on the avocado though).  Also tried the breakfast buzz shake, which had pretty good flavor, but was more icy and less creamy than I would have liked.3.25 stars.

Adequate coffee and drinks near my house and right across from the Central/Roosevelt light rail stop.  I'm working my way through the menu, and even though the psychoslow service is somewhat unreal, I'm never here when I'm in a hurry.

Are the frittatas gone?  The downtown location has supplied some lovely frittata dates in the Civic Space by the Goofy LED Boners for me, but I can't ever seem to get a luscious pair of frittatas shaken in my face at this location anymore.

The chai is very inconsistent from day to day, but I still walk here and have one a day some weeks.  The smoothies taste like they're made with sugary purees; I'd still rock one on the rare days when I don't give a rat's damn about high sugar consumption.  I like the frequent drinker card and the adorable filing system at the register.

Must try their biscuits and gravy.  Breakfast is nextest.Good dim sum during the weekend. Some of the food (such as the green beans and spring rolls) are cold. The spring rolls are good enough that you do not mind eating them cold, but the green beans stir fry just taste bad when you eat them cold.
They have more variety and the service is actually better during the weekend. Do not go during the week.It's subway. I'm not really sure what else to say. But it's near my office and when I forget lunch, and don't want anything the cafeteria has to offer and I'm on a limited time budget this place wins every time. 

Only downfall is that if you go directly at noon, you're gonna be in line for awhile, due to the office folk. Go a little early or a little late and you'll be good to go.So, I'm working on a few scrapbook projects, and decided it was time to work on some decor for the apartment.  I have some great photos I want to hang on my walls from recent trips, and instead of purchasing frames, I decided to get creative and make my own type frame with scrapbooking supplies.  I was in the market for chip board, which is a real heavy, thick book like material.  Its very sturdy and thick, and wanted to use this as the backdrop for my photos.

Finding chipboard has been a bit of a pain in the butt.  I couldn't find it at any of the major retailers, and figured I had to go to a specialty store to get some.  That's fine, I go to the specialty stores anyways, so its not a problem.  Plus, all of them are small businesses, so I'm really killing two birds with one stone.  I get my supplies, and I'm supporting a small family run business.  Every one wins, right?

I found scrap happy sisters on Yelp and gave them a shout today on the phone.  Its hot, and I wanted to make sure they had my supplies before I drive across town and waste my time.  When I called in, the lady was kinda rude and on the phone.  I asked her if she had chip board, and she was like "yea." I asked her what sizes, and she told me.  I asked her what time they were open until, and she was like "o, yea midnight since I'm having a class."  O, well excuse me for interrupting your day there princess hope things are getting better for you at the castle.  

Anyways, the store itself is cute and has some great products.  Classrooom seems a bit tight, and was packed when I was there.  They must have been having some kind of all day scrap a thon going on, because there wasn't an empty seat to be found.  Prices seemed fine on supplies, but I would steer clear of their scrapbooks as they seemed a bit over priced.

Overall, the store is okay, but the lady behind the counter is really not friendly and unhelpful. I literally had to beg her to help me, and so I deducted 2 stars. I might go back, but not quite sure yet.Tasty but very disappointing service and cold pizza. I even tipped well when I payed w ordering.I've been here at least a half dozen times if not more. Always neat atmosphere but hit or miss with the food. I really don't like their chili burger with bits of sirloin in the chili, nasty!! Their country fried steak can be nasty as well; however their chicken fried chicken is pretty good. The best meal was their chicken taco salad...really delicious. 

The atmosphere is OK; they have a lot of TVs all about even the outdoor patio. I think it would be difficult to watch NFL Sunday games there; the place is not large enough to have the sound going for each game without it' simply being noisy and can't hear your game. 

At most, this place is a nice local joint for South Mountain, OK meal, and OK beer selections to meet up with friends once in a while.Lollicup is a franchise I first experienced back in LA.  I come here every now and then, but the odd location is definitely not favorable for business.  It's so quiet...too quiet at times.  I have some Boba and zzzzzzz.....  I'm sure this place does well for pickups to stay around.  Nothing too special about their Bobas except the cup says Lollicup not some other store name.  I'm used to the Boba service - give me my Boba without a smile and go about your way - fair enough I guess.  Decor...um sure they have chairs and tables.  What's pretty cool about this place is the board games.  Any one for some Connect 4?  I was champ back in the 4th grade...oh yeah...and I was sporting a bowl cut hairstyle too while connecting my fours ;) - enjoy!Eh was definitely not as good as the other boba house, in tempe
The boba was sorta not up to par and my melon slush was more like semi cold melon milk. Also one drink that was about 16 oz was 5-6 dollars

Im down to give lollicup another try but I've found that mom and pop places are usually better at boba (or maybe I'm just spoiled by Cali Boba Shops)okay so this review is a little biased. The first time i went here was with my (now) x-husband, and he happened to be break out the "I want a divorce" while we were eating. 

I really do like the food here, and it's an excellent place to go for a lunch break, or with your family (getting all choked up)  
I love spicy food...I came here last night after craving carne asada all day.  So I hopped on over here after work and almost missed it because it's tucked away and it's super small.  The burrito did not disappoint.  Carne asada was perfectly seasoned, tortilla warm and slightly toasted, guacamole and pico de gallo with just enough kick... I admit that I'm drooling just a little bit right now as a write this.  If it came with a little rice inside I would have given this place 4 stars.They are remodeling the place. It's gigantic but a little messyI've been to several ZIPP locations.  ZIPPS has great food.   This restaurant is lacking consistency. Soggy fries and onion rings. A kids hamburger that looked like it was chunks of left over meat.  3 stars because I know what they can do, just hope they overcome the problems they have had at this location.Okay, so I took my baby to Good Night Pediatrics recently and so this was the closest 24hr pharmacy that took my insurance...so yeah. I haven't actually ever been in this store, So I really can't review on that. BUT, I have gone through the drive thru for the pharmacy...at first I was going to give this CVS a two stars, BECAUSE the first associate and pharmacist that helped me, I wasn't really impressed and when I first picked up my prescriptions, the pharmacist usually needs to review the rx's with you, but the chick just handed me the bag, said,"have any questions?"..LOL...but I did a tard move recently....I administered my baby her first dose, had my 6 yr old close the bottle and place in the refrigerator... then 12 hrs later went to give my baby another dose...DIDN'T check the cap...shook the bottle, THEN got that awesome pink, bubble gum scented amoxicillin all over myself, my baby, the carpet, and couch....AWESOME! I know :) HA!
So, I just called over to the pharmacy this morning and the pharmacist was like, "it happens all the time". I just thought, "Really? Cause its first tard move for me" ...lol. Don't know if she was just being nice...anywho she called and checked if my insurance would waive the cost for the rx since it had no refills and yada, yada, yada...hehe...long story, short...I cleaned up the 10 days worth of amox off my carpets, couch, bathed my baby, and got a new rx...I'm happy!Wendy's food should be about the same regardless of location. This review is not about the food, but the service.

I stopped here today on my way to Rocker World. Wow, what a mistake. The food was fine, but I've never seen slower fast food service in my life. I waited 10 minutes in line with 2 other orders in front of me and another 10 minutes for the food. 

I'm still deciding if the new fries with sea salt are as good as the previous fries.....

Unless you have lots of time, you may want to hit another location.Great Philly Cheese. Good Service. Solid Steak, add the wiz you'll be satisfied. Great game day or cheat day food.This review is for the delivery/carry out service of pizza hut.  This location is run by experienced management and their kitchen is clean.  Delivery can sometimes take a while since this place services a large area however its good to know that its a competent adult managing this place and not some zit faced high schooler.  The food here is the same as any other pizza hut and they do have wing street and lunch buffet as well.I have lived very close to this Thai-rama in Chandler for years, and finally started going there about six months ago.  The food is absolutely wonderful.  Always fresh.  

However, I am only giving them three stars due to the service.  As another reviewer mentioned, the service is getting worse.  The first time I went there, it seemed okay, but my last visit for lunch a full hour.  The restaurant was crowded, but there were only 3 wait staff.  After about 10 minutes, our first waiter asked us what we wanted to drink. 15 minutes after that, we still didn't have our drinks. Another waitress came by and asked for our drink order.  We told her the other waiter took our order and she replied he is busy, so she will get them. By that time, we also knew what we wanted for lunch, so we placed our food order. 

After about another 10 minutes, the waitress came around with a large tray of soup bowls.  They pretty much served half the restaurant soup at the same time.  Finally, after another wait, we received our lunch.  By the time we got the check and paid, it was an hour since we had walked in the door and sat down.  

Again, the food here is wonderful, but they really need to work on the service aspect.  Although the restaurant is not too large, when full, they should have at least 4 servers.  I felt bad for the people sitting next to us.  Although they ordered their food about 10 minutes before we did, they didn't get it until about 10 minutes after we received our lunch.  I could tell they were not very happy.3 1/2 stars

I am disappointed that they didn't offer free continental breakfast and that, as a Hilton rewards member, I didn't get a copy of the newspaper. Ah, just occurred to me that I believe they give the wsj which doesnt have a Sunday edition and I was only there one day. Additionaly, the bed matress felt mushy/too soft.

The positives:
-Clean bedroom
-Quiet
-Ample Parking
-Courteous staff
-Easy to find/near freeway
-Reasonable priceThe atmosphere is what to be expected for a sports bar....Great place to meet with friends and have a cold one!......Staff is very friendly....Food is OK......for the money you pay the portions are really to small.....Love their chicken wings and pizzas!!!!! .....Being it's within minutes of my house and I felt lucky, I figured why not go try my luck. 

My 1st impression from the outside, it looks decent, my second impression upon walking in,  the smell of SMOKE. 2nd hand smoke galore.... If you like 80 year old's with oxygen tanks lighting up right next to you this may be your spot. It's somewhat dated and could use an update or 2, but not a bad lil hole in the wall casino if you can hack the smoke long enough. Slots right weren't overly loose, I did manage to scrap a away some schillings from the table games, nothing to retire on but, better then donating. 

Be sure to get a Players card if it's your 1st time as you get 10.00 and a lifetime of spam mail from them.

I'm sure I'll return being it's so close, but I won't wear Sundays best as it's bound to get a smoky odor and holes in my pockets...Typical McDonald's in terms of food, however, this location is a lot slower than others. That can be a good thing since your food will be hot and fresh, but not so much if you're limited on time. They always get the orders right, which is a plus.I'm from San Jose, so it's almost unfair for me to rate this boba. But I'm gonna do it anyway. 

Boba in San Jose/Cupertino is a-plenty. Literally, there's a boba shop on every frickin' corner. And it's my lifeline. Loves it!

So when I told the Boyfriend that I was disappointed in Phoenix's lack of boba, he ruffed up his feathers and said, Let's go to Chandler!

He brought me here on the recommendation of his friends and I happily ordered the Jasmine milk tea with boba.

Actually, I was pleasantly surprised. While this totally doesn't compare to San Jose/Cupertino boba, it holds its own. It has the distinct milk tea flavors and the boba was a nice chewy consistency. 

I'd go again, if I had a boba craving in Phoenix. And the Boyfriend was willing to drive me to Chandler.So living in Scottsdale (or phoenix for that matter) I don't have a lot of choices when it comes to Boba, but this place is definitely as good as it gets in this city.  How I miss Tapioca Express in San Diego (yumm).  Well righting this review has got me craving a Chocolate Snow Bubble w/ baby Boba, but I will have to wait until the weekend.  I like to make my way over there on Sat morning.It's a good place to take my young son to kill some time and entertain him - but it's pricey that we will spend $25 on a player card for 150 points and each game ranges from 5-11 points to play.  You get tickets for games that you play depending on how well you do and you can trade your tickets in for a "prize".  In the end, for $25, we got 721 tickets which equated to 200 points for a laffy taffy candy and we have saved the rest to save up for "next time" to get more tickets so the boy can get a stuffed angry bird (of which we could probably get a cheaper one at a store).  I couldn't justify spending the rest of the tickets on candy costing upwards past 200 tickets.Prices typical of other AMC's and theaters in general nowadays (too much).  I stuck with my free courtesy cup of ice water.  Maybe they should use some of that money to renovate the bathrooms, which felt like a claustrophobic mirrorless bunker with too many brown and black stains where they shouldn't have been. What if you want to check yourself out or clean up before heading back to your date waiting outside? Maybe they were upgrading but didn't put signs up. Maybe not. Picture and sound itself were good BUT the hallway lights on either side of the theater room reflected off the screen, which I found annoying until they blended in with the mechanical scenery of huge transformers/monsters of Pacific Rim.When I lived in AZ, this was my favorite watering hole. I would go after kickball or softball games and it's rare in this part of Scottsdale to have such a bar. Kayla is the best waitress EVER. Always made sure my group was taken care of and never failed to remember my order (so yeah, i was a regular). I have never had bad service from her.
The food at this location is really so-so. I have also been many times to the one on Camelback which amazingly has better food. My faves are the pepperjack focaccia and their burgers are good. Their fries are really hit or miss though. Sometimes they are decent but other times they are just soaked in grease.

Go for the big beers and go early if you want to catch a sporting event.We've been coming here for years.  Dr Khurana was the one we have always seen.  She is great!  Fantastic!  Concerned, thorough, and caring.  But she's booked up for the next several weeks, and the winter school break was a convenient time to do this.  So I accepted a different MD at the office.

Today we saw Dr Keane.  Seemed like a nice lady, but she was not at all thorough.  This visit was a simple wellness/physical.  She hardly touched our daughter.  Other than listening to the heart and breathing, and asking "how do you feel", she really did nothing.  When I inquired about birth control pills for her severe menstrual cramps (a routine treatment for that problem) she made it sound like we were asking for experimental radical therapies!  It was absurd.  I suspect she has personal objections to 'the pill', which is even more annoying (since she is to treat our daughter, not impose her own preferences on her).

If I could move our daughter to an ob-gyn, I would.  But none will see her until she's 18.  Ditto our adult family doctor.  Seems silly since she's physically an adult now, but that's the policy.  Next physical I will be certain we get Dr Khurana again, and we'll ask that question again about the cramps (assuming she still has them, which she probably will).

I rated 3 stars because of Dr Keane.  She's a 2-star doctor, in my opinion.  If it were just Dr Khurana I would give 5 stars in a heart-beat.  I cannot comment on the other physicians in this practice.  We will not see Dr Keane again.I've been going to Sylvia's for years.  Now I live in the neighborhood and go at least twice a month.  It's very average Mexican food for Phoenix.  Over the years Sylvia's food quality has gotten worse and their prices have gotten higher.  

Pro:
Good for large groups
Chips and salsa bar
Catering is great for parties at home
Large patio

Con:
Too much dark meat in chicken entrees
Dinner prices are too expensive for what you get
The signs posted by management that hang all over the place telling customers what to do
Obnoxious paint colorsClean
Good food
some time it take more than 20  minute for them to add more food,I had to tell them to refill the mongolian beef.Pretty good Chinese food! We've been here a couple of times, and both times the food was good. They give you wontons and a salad right after you order, and the food we had as leftovers heated up very nicely! It tasted almost as good as the food did when it first came out.

Great lunch prices!Was in Vegas this past weekend and we came here for dinner. It was a nice place and heard good things about it. Its Vegas, so its going to be expensive on the strip let alone its in the forum shops at Ceasers. Anyhow, the sushi grade was great and most of the rolls were really good. The Katana roll was amazing. I ordered a side of the sweet potato tempura and i got two slice for 6 bucks. Had i known that, i probably wouldn't had ordered it. Anyways, it was good, but i would rather had eaten somewhere else for that amount of money.Good service, good food, good specialsThe concept of the The District seems like it'd be a great one...Street-like setting with shopping on either side of the walkway and apartments above.   The stores that attract me there are REI, Anthropologie, WS and Pottery Barn....oh wait, and Lucille's BBQ.  Other than that, nothing really else to see.  

The street/walkway is really short.  You could walk from one end to the other in less than 10 minutes.  I guess the shops are suppose to attract you in so you end up strolling down, but other than the ones listed, there's not much else.  Maybe if there was a live band in the evening , cafes or outdoor vendors or something, it'd be a better hang out spot.We walked around here, mostly to get some fresh air outside of the smoked filled casino. We grabbed some iced tea at the Coffee Bean and sat outside and watched people go by. If you must go shopping while on vacation, I guess you could do some here, but there are much better shopping areas/malls at the strip. Usually the last thing I wanna do is shop when on vacation, but if thats your thing this place is cool.I had the bone-in ribeye stake here and frankly, I was not impressed. The steak did not have enough flavor. I am a steak eater and I am not even sure if I had prime steak because the marbling was not there. I do not mind paying $50+ for steak but it has to have quality. I ordered a side of sauteed spinach and button mushrooms, which was mediocre. 

This is a very nice place but I am not sure about giving it four or five stars; maybe if the meal was less expensive.In terms of visual presentation, this is a fantastic art gallery to visit. Some of the nature photos are just stunning to view.

However, I'm calling FAIL on the photos being completely "authentic" and "natural", and the pictures were taken and processed "as is" without any additional adjustments or effects. I'm sorry you may believe that, but it's bullshit.

Look, I'm an amateur photographer, but a decent pro at photo *editing*. For someone to claim these photos weren't post processed or touched up with any kind of hue, saturation, or lighting adjustments by some photo editing application is complete and utter nonsense.

So, if you want to view some completely beautiful photos, then stop by here. However, if you *really* think these are "raw" and "natural" photos, then I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you...which is even more funny since I live in the great state of Texas!Lovely location overlooking the lake.  Flexible with last-minute reservations (and we were a party of 7).  Not ideal for small children.  Had to flag down the server multiple times (more water, ready to order, ready for the check)...The food wasn't bad, but overly priced.  The wine and dessert lists were both extensive.  But here's why I won't return: two antipasta plates were brought out by the server and as we did not order/ask for this, we assumed it was a complimentary offering.  When the bill arrived, we were charged $72 for the plates ($12 per adult), which we naturally disputed.  On top of the server not removing the antipasta from the bill, he refused to assist us by separating the bill into 4 checks (which in honesty wasn't something we asked for upfront, but hey, it happens).  With Lake Las Vegas' Village struggling the way it is, you'd think the businesses there would bend over backwards to bring their patrons back, especially the locals.  Long story short, I've got a bad taste in my mouth after this experience, and won't be recommending this restaurant any time soon.I ordered their yakisoba chicken bowl and it was yummy but the yakisoba was cold and it was definitely undercooked. I love my noodles al dente but they were definitely still undercooked by far.  The flavor of the bowl was good and it was a good portion size too.  The prices are ok but a little over priced in my opinion.  I saw some other things on the menu that I would try and would definitely go back and check them out.Stayed here for a few days with the family during a house hunting adventure before we moved here.

It's not where all the Strip action is, but it's close enough that you can get there in a few minutes by car or taxi. They might have a shuttle, but we rented a car, so we didn't have much need. It's close to the outlets and Town Square, which is an excellent outdoor shopping center. The rooms are big with fully stocked kitchens and dining areas. There aren't many dining options available (Denny's and Tahiti Joe's,) but you can always put that kitchen to use! Ignore the timeshare offers and you're all set.Delicious food.  My friend and I were actually waiting at Las Islitas, but because it was a fight weekend AND Mexican Independance Day we couldn't hold our appetite any longer.  Someone had mentioned El Diamante to us so we figured we would try this place out.  We called to see if they were busy, which they said they were but said they would set up a table for two.  This place was not as busy as Las Islitas, but that was good for us.  They have mariachi bands as well.  Now if you are not used to mariachi bands playing while you eat, you might want to bring earplugs.  Not saying that they are bad, but it is REALLY loud.  Not a place to have intimate conversations, this setting is to eat and drink and enjoy the mariachi band(s).  

Food wise, we had the appetizer oyster topped with ceviche, omg that was so tasty.  Their seafood dishes, you cannot go wrong.  I actually had a beef dish to mix it up a little as my main dish, but I can't recall what exactly it was called.  Its a really long name that started with a Z...haha I hope that helps but that was yum.  They serve it with 4 tortillas.  2 with Cheese the other with beans.  It was delicious and spicy and I emphasize SPICY.  I highly recommend.  

My friend spoke fluent in Spanish and that did help a lot.  Makes the conversation with the staff easier.  

Their food is yummy and I will definitely return for more.  I just would feel comfortable bringing a Spanish speaking person with me, LOLWe went because of the many reviews and it was near the hotel where our friends were staying. Pleasantly surprised by the pretty interior and our table had a wonderful view of the pool & shark tank. 

None of us had starters but a basket of bread was brought to the table along with some olive oil. NOTHING special about the bread-it could have came from Smith's or Albertson's... 

I had the Cannelloni (17.99) which was stuffed with chicken and spinach, with béchamel and marinara sauce. The plate was served with 2 cannellonis which were delicious. My husband had the Filet alla Griglia (34.99), a center-cut filet with Italian roasted potatoes and asparagus topped witha rich Borolo demi-glace. He enjoyed every bite & said the asparagus was cooked perfectly!. One friend had the Fettuccine alla Campagnola(17.99) which had chicken, mushrooms, peas, mozzarella in a sugo rosa sauce. She said it was very good. Our other friend had the Rigatoni della Sansoni (18.99) which had a meat sauce and is normally topped with homemade meatballs but our friend asked if italian sausage could be substituted instead , which they did with no hesitation or extra charge. 

The staff was very pleasant & attentive without being intrusive. 

That said, I can only give this restaurant 3/5 stars.  There is no way we would go out of our way to eat here again given all of the italian eateries in town and given the price, nothing we tasted was "out of this world" and portions were very small and only a few of the pricier entrees came with sides (albeit very small portioned sides).The place is nice, big and clean looking.  I like when they open the sterile bags in front of you and the lady I had didn't do this.  So it made me kinda nervous that everything was clean.  She must've been new because the other lady was telling her things she missed.  I was reading my magazine not really paying attention and she ended up painting my nails a different color than I picked out.  I have no idea where she got the other color when the color I picked was sitting right next to me.  Paint job was just ok.  I was visiting from out of town so I may give it another try when I'm back here visiting but my experience today was nothing better than just ok.Stone Crabs ... We came to Joe's for the famous Stone Crabs ..., but they didn't have any. Why? Only Joe's knows. We should of left.

Unfortunately, Joe's was already our second choice of the night (after seeing the long line at Bacchanal) and we weren't going in search of a 3rd restaurant. We were hungry, so, let's eat at Joe's.

Luckily, the other food was pretty tasty. We started with some glasses of inexpensive Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon and a Colossal Lump Crab Cake ($17). I liked the big bits of crab that didn't require (or have) much other seasoning (4 stars). 

Equally, the Chilean Sea Bass with Miso Glaze & Bok Choy ($37) and 20 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye Steak ($53) were 4-star entrees. The sea bass was flaky and the miso subtle. Meanwhile, the juicy and tender rib eye was meaty despite not being an elite steak. As a side, we split a creamy Wild Mushroom Mac and Cheese ($11) that excited thanks to the mushrooms and disappointed with lame cheese (3 stars).

Sadly, the service was weak. We suffered long gaps between being seated, ordering, getting food, or service. We wanted to try the acclaimed Key Lime Pie, but chose to try a different place at the Forum Shops at Caesars rather than put up with the poor service.

Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab is famous in Miami for fantastic Stone Crabs and Key Lime Pie. We didn't get to try either. Instead, Joe's became a basic Joe Schmo steak and seafood chain with high prices for the average Joe.I didn't know until I went in today that this particular location barely has any snowboarding gear.  There was also no one around to ask for help.  I wandered the store aimlessly until it sunk in that my lunch hour quest for new snowboarding pants was made in vain.  Desperate to make my trip worth something, ANYTHING, I grabbed a facemask and made my way to the cashier.  She was on the phone with a customer so I waited while they discussed the intricacies of netting vs. no netting for tents and whether or not hiking socks really made a difference.  

Finally, another employee came up and rang me up.  He told me that the other REI on Rampart is where all the snowboarding gear is sold.  50/50 chance, I guess!  I rolled the dice and lost.  Or is it toss the coin?  Well, whatever, you know what I mean. Anyway!  This store is small compared to other REI's I've been into and doesn't have much of a selection.  The cashier was particularly pushy about the fact that REI is a co-op, and for a small $20 fee, you can be a lifetime member and get up to 10% back at the end of the year.  Great!  If you shop there a lot, which I don't.  

I'm making the trek to Rampart next week and I am not leaving without new snowboarding pants!! :)This place is NOT near the strip. The hotel was clean and cheap! i would definitey reccommend staying here if you don't mind driving a little ways to get to the strip. they have a casino inside! $5 craps! woohooThey have a pretty nice buffet. I go for lunch usually. Good service. Reasonable prices. Good selection. All in all it's worth a try!Regular longjohns experience, nothing special. The place was real clean tho.Good food at a good price should work on customer service though.Ate dinner here after a long drive.  Good service and the employees were friendly and the cooks were really working hard.  Got my food fast and it was great! Will come back!I've been too quite a few Bdub locations in Vegas and just came here for the last UFC fight. Gotta say that this was by far the best location we've been too. How is it possible for your food to taste better at one location and not have the same consistency as the others? This is going to be our new Bdub spot from here on out. I believe it's limited time but the Wasabi Wings are awesome. If you like wasabi it's a must try.Trump doesn't have casino, no self parking, and no two-bed units (although it showed on my hotel-agency website)  If you order two-double-bed units, you will get a king-size bed and a queen-size sleep over, which is NOT comfortable at all.  

i stayed in one-bedroom unit with beautiful view facing the strip, especially from the huge window right above the bath tub. The pool was my favorite too.  Trump, Wynn, and Encore are just around you!

But when we asked for extra pillows and sheets, it kept us waiting for hours.

Overall, i like it, but hopefully they can be more clear about the unit description and improve the speed about their services.Buzz BBQ is decent 'Que but unfortunately based on my loving relationship with Dinosaur BBQ(probably the best BBQ ever) I simply can't rate it higher than 3 stars.

The $20 special including 3 meats, 2 sides, and rolls is a great meal to split with a date or just a good friend who wants to pig out. A great array of meats and sides allows you to truly sample the menu. Unfortunately the meat was a bit cold when it came to the table but the hot BBQ sauce was delicious! 

I'll definitely be giving Buzz BBQ a second chance to impress simply because I have a soft spot in my heart for authentic BBQ. The owner seems like he truly had a passion for what he was doing and I appreciate that.Not bad for a neighborhood store. Their merchandise is good quality and they offer a good extensive selection on wines from different countries. However, the store prices are a bit high, so make sure to become a member it does help at the cash-register.The service is great, the food's pretty good, and the drinks are great (they put dry ice in the drinks so they're all bubbly and exciting looking), but I am just not a fan.

For what you get, the food seems completely overpriced. The atmosphere is nice but it's definitely for an older crowd, and is often quite empty. They sometimes have live music, and the background music is often country.. maybe another reason i'm not a fan.Please note: I have never stayed here, but I have spent NYE and several weekends on strip and somehow always end up at PH.  The ladies room is one of those fully stocked where the attendant gives you soap & your paper towel. You also have a choice of fragrances and VS lotions and potions. And even cigarettes. I quit in May but I just had to have weekend before last. I would say this casino has the younger crowd, I love one of their lounges they play the best latin music. Its kind of near the pleasure pit. now the heart bar kinda sucked. We went there once and were just trying to see the end of the colts game back in football season and the girl said i'm sorry you need to order at least 2 drinks each if you want to see the rest of the game. I've never been told that in a casino before. otherwise they would have gotten 4 stars. there was 1 min. left in the game. I would have gone back if she hadn't said this. ah well, PH, you win some, you lose some. But personally, its better to be nicer to locals since they will be back sooner than tourists. ah well...Normally I have an aversion to all things carrying a Planet Hollywood label, but it seems the former Aladdin has done a remarkable transformation into its semi-new posh look.  The Los Angeles glam and glitz theme is perfectly executed, with the property looking its best and brightest at night.  Most folks who knew the Aladdin well are sure to be impressed at the significant upgrades from the rooms to the casino.

By far the biggest changes have been in their beautiful casino, gorgeous bars / lounges, and the upgraded mall now known as the Miracle Mile (formally the Desert Passage).  Cheesy, but most definitely "LA" is the Extra Bar & Lounge where the show Extra is actually filmed at least once a week.  I've seen Mario Lopez doing his thing during my last few visits, I seem to forget how short he is practically every time.

Without a doubt, the most impressive interior changes have been made to its casino.  The abundant tables with the chic dealers do a good job of allowing their patrons to enjoy their surroundings.  Poker players are sure to like the decent sized Poker room, however, PH doesn't run many poker events as often as they do other house rated games. I could be wrong on this, but it doesn't seem that their craps tables are rated on odds, resulting in better comps for bigger players.  Their A+ program seems to be pretty good and previous Aladdin players can resume their statuses from past play.  One thing that I wish they'd improve on is the ventilation on the casino floor, its a little too smoky on the weekends.

So what's the deal with the rooms?  The larger suites and some of the standard rooms are still sporting the Aladdin decor, which are all going to be finished sometime this year.  The regular rooms (Hollywood, Deluxe, etc.) are tiny and are 400 sq ft at best.  That's solid for a Manhattan studio but not fabulous in Las Vegas.  The big suites on the other hand (Panarama, Fountain Views, Boulevard etc) are fantastic with plenty of space (1500 sq ft +) and usually sport a great view.

Service all around is fairly good.  From the folks at the front desk to the executive staff running the joint to even the bartenders at the lounges, everyone has been sporting a smile without a snotty LA attitude (thank goodness this theme aspect never carried over).

Since the PH takeover, the demographic for this casino property went from senior citizen level to extremely young.  There are more youngins frequenting this joint more than ever, attracted by the trendy glow of its LA theme with potential celebrity sightings given their constant publicity (Pageants, concerts, Extra airings, shows, etc.).  The younger generation could use some better nightlife, Prive is a disappointment and their lounges can get boring once the eye candy wears thin.Crawfish is good. Mainly because they are larger here than most other places ive seen. This place, the little guys were big enuf that you could pull the meat out with minimal effort. Ive been to places where you sit there peeling back the shell and when you're done, the meat is almost gone because it got squished between your fingers and gets lost in a boatload of shells.

The seasoning is good, although a bit oily from the butter. The spices left me out of commission the next morning but  was worth it at the time.

We also ordered the King Crab which tasted OK but it definietly wasnt fresh. You can tell it was frozen stored because the shell was soft and stale when it came to our table.  When you peeled the shell off, a lot of water came gushing out.

For $20 something a pound, we expected fresh.  

All in all, it was a fun experience we thank Adam Richman for telling us about.

BTW, they need to move that dumpster full of rotting crawfish leftovers away from the part of the building thats visible. The sweltering vegas desert heat doesnt help much either. The smell after leaving the restaurant was mortifying.Good service with well seasoned seafood except for the taste less oysters that I don't recommend to anyone who loves oysters.Neat little place in the middle of the Grand Canal Shoppes in the Venetian. Nothing special, but they have great HH food specials. I just had some calamari and a glass of water. I sat in the bar area and the bartender was very nice and chatty. I looked at the menu, and it was a little pricey for stuff that didn't seem all that great.The food was great no denying that. I'm trying to cut down on my salt intake so when I order the matzoh ball soup I asked for a cup of hot water, yea, well I got the water and when I received the bill later they had charged me $1.00....for a hot cut of water. Thought that was pretty ridiculous, but hey took it off of the bill for so I guess that was nice. 
*woof*...sketchy and overpriced, odd smelling and poorly managed - but walkable from the strip and a decent sound system plus large screens and a good matinee price for Django Unchained on Christmas Day 2012 while waiting for my family to arrive.  Can't say I'd frequent the place, but it sufficed in a pinch.Have been here 3 times and, honestly, I don't understand the fuss. Maybe because it was featured on diners, drive ins and dives? The food is good, but not smack your mama good. A fairly simple menus with family- friendly dining is what you'll get, nothing more, nothing less.Since I've moved back to Glendale I've been looking for a non-chain burger joint.  So I was very excited to see a Lenny's Burger shop opening up at the corner of 59th Ave & Peoria.  Just a few miles South of where I live.  

After watching it being slowly be redone and painted for about 6 months it finally opened in June.  So last Saturday I drove my car down there and utilized the drive through.  After screaming my order a bunch of times in their drive through speaker I finally drove around to pick up my 2 burgers and onion rings.   I don't like all that veggie stuff on my burger so I just ask for it plain with ketchup and mayo.  Next time maybe I should just go inside.  But it was so small I didn't want to stand in the heat.  Hey, it's 111 out!

Now I've been to a couple of other Lenny's Burger places - 35th & t-bird and downtown Glendale.  Maybe they are only connected in name only as this new Lenny's menu was very limiting.  Onion rings and fries were it.  

The burgers were quite tasty and fresh.  Onion rings were barely cooked and soft. yuck!  So I think from now on I'll just go back to the Lenny's Burger shop at 35th Ave & T-bird as I know they have more choices and hopefully my onion rings won't be yuck...Nothing great here unless you're going for average style shopping. All I can remember is an H&M, a store that sold Ed Hardy goods, and some random private boutiques that didn't sell all that much.

I would much rather choose Caesar Forum Shops or Palazzo Shops. If you want to shop somewhere with a lot of variety, then you might as well head to the mall!Basically a common mall located at the Planet Hollywood Hotel and is connected to the PH Casino. You will find most of these stores in  any major metropolitan city mall. Average to low end stores if your looking for Prada or Lanvin go else where. The mall still have some of the architecture from the old Aladdin hotel when it use to be the desert passage mall the Rain shower show still occurs in the mall. Over all average mall nothing to special except a fat Tuesdays.Ate here once when we stayed at Bally's and it's located closer to the Paris side of where all the shops and casino is.

They got a bunch of $8-$10 burgers over here served with french fries.  Pretty good.  Portabella mushrooms, onion rings, and some other stuff that comes packed in some of those burgers.

They also got a fully stocked square bar in the middle, so if you feel like getting your drank on for lunch over here since IT IS Vegas, then those Bloody Mary's, Mimosas, Screw Drivers, and Beers aren't too far away.I actually forgot I ate at Le Burger Brasserie. It was okay, not memorable. Wife and I had been heading out of Vegas that time around noon, and decided we better get sometime to eat. We hadn't had breakfast and to be honest, weren't really all that hungry. I guess that's what a week in Vegas will do to anybody. We actually split the le kobe with crispy bacon on a seasame bun with the waffle fries and the chocolate shake. It was pretty good, maybe we should have had a sauce or spread on it. Didn't realize we had to add sauces for an additional charge. The patty wasn't bad, although I'm sure that guy wasn't made in house. The waffle fries were crispy and hot, however way over salted with the seasoning. The chocolate shake was good too. Nothing out of this world. Actually, we would probably try it again. 

The hostess was actually one of the more friendly out of all the restaurants we dined at this round in Vegas, however our server was hasty and a little insincere. When she picked up our bill, I had wanted to use some hotel credits towards the meal, and remaining balance on my debit card. As I'm trying to explain to her she is still walking off with the check. Oh well, she figured it out. But please... To all servers... Listen to your patrons. I know you hear it all, but at least to us, and most people, the service makes our meal, not always the actual food. I feel in this case, the food would have been better if the server was actually there for us.SBC VEGAS SERIES: 4 of many reviews
Late late night eats for late night drinks..

Bare in mind that I've been here a few times during my trip but I think the last time I was there was a highlight.  

Keeping that in mind... 

Despite what my drunken, irritable, and anxious fellow compatriots felt about this place.. I liked it. Not a place I would go out of my way to get to, but if it's an elevator ride... and a drunken crawl away then hell yes! Blanking out the unsavory pre-late late dinner conversation I found that  the ambiance was typical kitchy Vegas with an unusual mix of culinary fare... between congee, chicken and waffles, and really good orange juice.. it wasn't half bad. It would actually have rated higher if not for the typically slow service one can find @ 4am. My bbq duck noodle soup was pretty damn good. The broth wasn't over seasoned and the noodles, though not what I had wanted because I can't differentiate between egg noodles and vermicelli, were just right. Wish I knew how to eat duck off the bone though but it being such a late late hour my eating etiquette was no where to be found. 

Many antics later I told everyone to leave money and for them to go to sleep while I waited to take care of the bill. The things that apparently I missed if I had only left with them is probably a short lived regret... considering the driver's license that was lost. In that time that I waited to pay for our time there.. i was able to find some solace in the whirlwind that is Vegas. 

And then I drank. 
Again.
;DArriving on a red eye from HI, we were able to check in early but didn't feel like straying far for sustenance.  First stop, Starbucks, conveniently located next to PD.  Then over to meet the rest of the girls who already ordered.  I wasn't read for a big breakfast & they allowed me to special order 2 scrambled eggs for $2.95.  One of the girls got the big breakfast that had enough for 2 people and my other cousin got pancakes w/a side order of hash that was delish!  Food was ok but price coulda been better.  Most menu items were in the $10-15 range and was entirely too much food.Impressive menu, reminds me of another large-format eatery that sells cheesecake on the side.  It was Father's day, lunchtime and I was hoping to go to a new BBQ place in Chandler.  Unfortunately, that place was mobbed.  Activate Plan B.

CJ's was busy, but not mobbed.  our party of four got seated right away and we were quickly greeted by an amiable waittress who got our drink orders and an appetizer order.  We had the onion rings with ranch dip.  They were delicious.  The ranch dressing tastes homemade here and that is a big plus.  The onion rings were big and crispy, with plenty for four.  The only downside was that some deep-fried fish stick got mixed in and I was the one who happened to grab it.  GAK!

for our entrees, the kids had BBQ chicken sandwich, tortilla soup, the wife had a mixed salad with blackened chicken and all sorts of other stuff.  They all enjoyed their entrees.  I couldn't decided, I was still jonesing for some BBQ and to get an idea of what they offered, I ordered the mixed ribs combination.  This was a small rack of Baby back ribs and a couple of big beefy bones.  The flavor was just ok, they were a bit dry and under-sauced but not too bad.  The beef ribs should have been tenderized somehow, it was a bit of effort to separate the edible parts from the non-edible parts.  As a followup, Ziggy, our pug, gave the beef bones two paws up.

The entree came with a potato choice, I chose the three-cheese, which was essentially a croquette with a little sauce on it.  I did not finish it, it was fairly flavorless.  The dish also came with sauteed vegetables, which was the standard squash mix that was overcooked and mushy, as well as under-seasoned.

Portions are big, the Iced tea was fresh and service was good.  It was nice that a manager came around to check on us after we got our meal.Just regular run of the mill theater.  The guy at the front wouldn't let me in with my chocolate shake from Cold Stone.  Some rules are just retarded.  So basically I have to stand there and finish it before I could go in.  Like that is going to matter in any way, shape or form, as if finishing it out there in 5 minutes sooner would affect my purchasing potential, of which I bought nothing, and had no plans on it.As a hotel to stay in for vacation, I would give the JW 5 stars.

As a wedding ceremony venue (just for location of ceremony and pictures), I would rate the JW 5 stars - the location and grounds are beautiful. 

HOWEVER, I purchased a package just for my ceremony, which included a wedding coordinator, and they get 1 star for this. Do NOT rely on your coordinator if you book here. Useless. Our rehearsal was at 4:30. He shows up at 4:00 and emails me that I'm late. In his defense, he realizes his mistake at around 4:30 and returns. I was outside where our rehearsal is supposed to be and there's a wedding out there. Our wedding party and their significant others are standing around me not knowing what to do. I go in the lobby and run into my coordinator. He says we can still have our rehearsal. Everyone heads back outside, and my coordinator comes to me 2 minutes later and says we need to do the rehearsal inside. No joke, there's a wedding on the site of our rehearsal. So everyone heads back inside. Fine, I can roll with it. 

We go to the empty restaurant inside for our rehearsal. I suppose I should have known that, for the rehearsal, I needed to bring with me the lineup of the wedding party. I wrote it down for my coordinator and incorrectly assumed he would have it. Wrong. Put on the spot, I can't remember who goes where. It seems easy enough but after having been a bit frazzled and people not knowing where to go for the rehearsal, I can't think straight. Does the coordinator try to help? No. I'm the one who has to raise my voice to get the wedding party to listen to me and line up. 

Then, on the day of the wedding about 10 minutes before the ceremony, it starts raining. Not the hotel's fault, of course, and they did have a backup ballroom for us. But after the ceremony, my brother told me that a lot of our family came late because the hotel told them 3 different ballrooms. My brother's phone was constantly ringing because he had to tell them the exact ballroom to go to. 

Meanwhile, 5 MINUTES BEFORE THE CEREMONY, the coordinator tells me our music CD isn't working, they can't play MP3s. Who the heck can't play MP3s?!?! And why didn't they tell me a week before when there was time for me to do something about it?! They waited until 5 minutes before the ceremony?!?! Are you freakin' kidding me?!  I told the coordinator that the CD worked just fine for us on our laptop, and they need to find a laptop. Thankfully, the sound guy found one and was able to play our music for us. But really, I didn't need all the stress. 

On top of that, my ceremony package included 2 nights in the junior suite. When I check out, they charged me for those nights. I had to email the coordinator and the events person to get the charge fixed.

Also, keep in mind that the rooms do NOT have full length mirrors. One would have been very handy while getting ready. I would noticed that my wedding dress would have looked better if I had removed the bra inserts that my alterations lady told me to get. 

Again, just for the location, the JW is great, so if you're gonna have your wedding here, plan to do everything on your own and you'll be fine.For the Excalibur- this place is pretty nice! We made a reservation the night of and managed to score one at a decent hour.
Our waitress was extremely nice and considerate. Always had our glasses refilled and asked us frequently if our food and beverages were up to our standards.
I ordered steak- of course! The bake potato is def a must order :) 
Compared to The Prime Rib Loft in Orlean's---this place is not as good. Portion to price is comparable however.It was good but nothing special...Home of the best $1 Margarita on the strip. Then again, I only know of two spots - Casino Royale and Bill's. The Casino Royale Margarita is pre-mixed and comes out of a machine. The one from Bill's is basically a ball of flavored ice with the Sauza shot poured into the cup that you then mix yourself. It feels stronger than Casino Royale's.

Also, we came across a pretty lively karaoke scene here. They have it Sunday-Wednesday, 8pm-2am. We noticed it because this one guy was doing a very crowd-pleasing performance of Rapper's Delight. A bunch of people even got up on the stage and started dancing with him. We thought to ourselves, "Who would want to follow that?" Well, there were some talented people in that crowd. We didn't stick around long, but it seemed like a fun night out if you're into that.Local restaurant with blah Mexican food.  I have had some great food and this wasn't one of the places that served it.  Prices are okay and they only take cash.The food is fantastic!   Nachos yum, Pizza - YES!  Pizza was Half BBQ/Half Pizza of Sustainability.  I loved the deep dish crust, really well made.  They just need to get their service game up.  We waited for 15 minutes to be served and servers kept passing us.  No bueno.  Large selection of beer which was great for AZ Beer Week, but I don't do beer.  I wish they had some cider!  Love the fact that they have a late Happy Hour!!!!Oh, mein Gott... vere to shtart?

I walked around and up to the Hole in the Rock area yesterday, which of course i'd seen from afar on my wanderings through the city. I was a little disappointed to find out it is being used by teenagers...as frankly, i think teenagers should be locked in their homes until they are 20.  The south-facing side is scattered with pumpkin seed shells and the rocks are a bit worn. I wanted to sit and soak up the really lovely view of downtown Tempe and Phoenix, but a group of teenagers and their babies (sad) came loudly through the hole and staked their claim. 

I have to say I would love to have a bike and sail through the trails in this park, the sidewalks are very well maintained.After spending the afternoon fighting with the BoA I needed a break. I ventured into Sahara Middle Eastern Resturant, I've read the yelpish praise and was hopeful. What I was met with was a nicely decorated small cozy resturant with Middle Eastern music in the background that was peppered with seemingly happy customers, yup - yelp got it right yet again! 

Happy and excited I ordered some sprtie and poured over the menu. I decided on the lunch platter with gyro meat, salad and hummus with a side of falafels. I enjoyed myself and took calls feeling very power lunch-ish. lol 

The food came and it was good... but not drop dead, slap my momma good. The hummus was WAY better than that crap you get at the grocery store, but Baiz makes it better; the falafels were good, but Phoenican makes better, gyros were okay, but Oliveo's is spectactular. I was slightly underwhemled at first.

It wasn't until I really started to think about describing this experience I thought of something: Sahara is consistently good, across the board. Which is really something, each of the aforementioned places have their weak points whereas Sahara didn't have any that I noticed. If there were one, I noticed the sole waiter pawned over some of the women while he ignored the rest of us, men included.... and he was a little pervy in doing so... So much so that I overheard a couple of women say that they love the food but the guy gives them the creeps.

To my yelpers, I say: Overall, the food is consistenly good and I'm glad I had given this place a try and if you're a female dining alone or with just the girls, be prepared to be a little creeped out, I gotta admit, I kind of was.Nice club but I think its had its time.  When we went the other night it seemed like we were ready to go after 5 minutes.  Not bad but def not great.  I will say nice door staff.it was saturday night and there was absolutely no line. everyone was at tryst and xs. 

very small club with lots of tables. outside patio for smoking cigarettes if i remember correctly.. (too much rumpyz) 

drinks were what youd expect. $15 long islands and $17 shots of rumpyz. 

it wasnt popping off like the other clubs but i liked the idea of being able to dance comfortably and not have to sit in an overpacked bar for drinks.The apps were great but the pho broth was surprisingly tasteless. There were quite a few veggie choices. The fried tofu in the pho was yummy. Also the service was good.Don't come here if you're worried about cholesterol levels.  This place is delicious and unpretentious.  Bring cash and an appetite.  You can't really get better fried chicken or waffles in town.Flat Top Grill is a Mongolian barbeque, so you pick your proteins and vegetables for a personalized stir fry.  Eat here is definitely a mixed bag.  Here is the break down:

Pros:

- Delicious variety of vegetarian proteins.  Two thumbs way up for going the extra mile to have the variety.
-  Lots of options so everyone, from carnivore to vegetarian to gluten free, can find something.
- Lots of fresh vegetables.
- Try the noodles, they soak up the delicious favors.
- You get what you want because you made it.
- The Roti bread is weirdly addictive.  Eat it when warm.

Cons:

- The restaurant space is open and loud.  Fun for dinner before a show at Sundance, but not good for a date.
- The restaurant has aged poorly.  The tables are damaged and the floors look permanently dirty.  Don't look behind the wok counter.  Just don't. 
- The staff is courteous, but their timing is off.  It can take them a while to bring you your food, so it is cold.  Or, they may leave the check as soon as you get your meal.  Or, sometime, condiments will disappear from your table.
- At $13 for a single trip, it is a little overpriced for what you are getting.
- Never EVER be at the restaurant when they are closing.  You don't want to watch the buffet items and sauces get dumped into bins for the next day.  Just trust me.

Generally, I would say that it is a great concept that has gotten tired of keeping itself together.  

Parking is in a lot across the street or next door in a free ramp.  Plan to park some distance away as Great Dane customers often fill the space.  

Accepts credit cards.

Challenging with children because the buffet is quite high.Decent sandwiches. I had a Hawaiian BBQ and a Full Montagu, and part of a Club. 

After a couple of times here, however, I'm not entirely sure why people bow down to this place. As I said, it is decent. Sure, it's obviously better than your run of the mill Subway, but Ike's (in the Bay Area) is vastly better.After a failed attempt to give Earl and Sandwich a shot back in September, I was happy to finally get my hands on one of their sandwiches last week. Preciousssss...(Golem from 'The Lord of The Rings')

NO LINE, YES!
I've read many Yelpers reviews that talk about having to wait in line. When we got to Earl's, thankfully when we got there, there was NO line. SCORE! I ordered The Earl's Club, and some pasta salad, and some chips, and (THERE'S ALWAYS ROO FOR DESSERT. WARNING WARNING.) a cookie and a fruit  parfait (I WAS HUNGRY!!!). =X 

NO LOVE AT FIRST BITE
Eh, there wasn't anything special about this sandwich and how it tasted. In fact I've had better sandwiches elsewhere (Little Lucca's in South San Francisco, CA). I was fairly disappointed because of the rave reviews I've read here on Yelp. Don't get me wrong the sandwich was still good, it was mediocre tasting and nothing to rave about. =X Goodness, I hope I don't get shot for this review!! 

CONCLUSION
Everything I ordered, that includes sides and desserts were just okay. Not awesome, not horrible BUT okay. So....3 STARS! Would I come back? Eh, maybe if I was desperately craving for a sandwich. =)Came here for the first time because a few friends were buzzing about it. We ordered a variety of sandwiches to try - Caprese, Italian, The original, The Earl's Club, The Ful Montagu, and the Chicken Chipotle Avocado as well as frozen lemonade. All the sandwiches were alright, nothing to rave or unique about their sandwiches. The caprese was terrible - lack of flavor and not enough basil. Do Not order the frozen lemonade unless you want to drink sugar water...it was so sweet we barely drank it.The quality of their bellini has gone down unfortunately :( I've been coming here for years .. pretty much ever since I moved here to Vegas when it was Bertolini or something like that .. Maybe it was because I ordered it during happy hour and they make it differently .. but it just wasn't the same .. fettucini alfredo was just okay this time too.. 

But their Pizzeta is still to die for .. it's absolutely delicious!! yummmmmmmmmmmmmm :) i will come back just for this .. as always teheh.Service was good. Had the BBQ bacon burger. It was very good. Meat was very fresh and burger made from scratch. I would go back.I missed trying the ceviche that Cien Agaves served at Yelp in Bloom, so when I was invited to go to Cien Agaves for a friend's birthday dinner this past Friday night, I was excited to check it out!

The birthday boy made a reservation for 8pm, and when we arrived fashionably late (thanks to my husband), the rest of our group (approximately 15 people) were already seated, eating chips and salsa, and drinking margaritas.  We caught up pretty quickly thanks to Lindsay, our waitress - I had a margarita made with Vodka and J went with a beer.  

The food was decent.  I think the 3.5 star average is right on... I split shrimp fajitas with J and shared in the guacamole, nachos, and a few other apps that the table had.  The guys that ordered the special ahi tacos really enjoyed them.  

I have yet to try the ceviche and I may even go for the tequila margarita next visit, but I'd for sure return to Cien Agaves in the future.  Two drinks was all I needed and I was done for the night.  Happy hour anyone?!The service was a little slow but the friendly service made up for it. The food was good (I got a kebab combo plate) and the servings generous. I don't remember but I don't think they have beer or wine though.My usual, americano. Too bad it's columbian beans.When in need of a happy hour or reverse happy hour, Gordon Biersch is usually a gold option. I hadn't been to one in some time but I remember the garlic fries being a must along with a beer on tap. They have a number of basic of bar food options to choose from and most are solid. 

Service is basic and I enjoy the option of having indoor or outdoor dining at this location. I usually end up on the patio if it isn't too cold or hot.After reading other reviews we decided to check out this show as the reviews implied the jokes and impressions were for our "age category". Most of his impressions are of people that were big stars passed away or are in the over 60 crowd. He has some REALLY FUNNY bits and some really not so funny bits. He does a lot of musical interludes with made up lyrics and corny lines which are too long and drawn out. The Elvis impression at the end was REALLY LONG with Gordie just babbling like the King as he had two older ladies rubbing his legs on either side. Very weird. Our show was almost 2 hours which was way too long and the theater is SO COLD by then you can't wait to leave. Bottom line is if he cut the show down to 60 - 75 minutes and did his best bits it would be a 5 star for sure. Very talented guy but needs someone to help arrange the presentation in a less schizophrenic manner. That said he is a very talented and entertaining guy.After living in Albuquerque for 6 years, I know good chile when I taste it. Los Dos Molinos serves up a damn good green chile. Unfortunately, the food over which the green chile is ladled isn't quite as spectacular. I tried the blue corn enchiladas and, while they were descent, they weren't special.

What's more, I was disappointed that the meal ended without a basket of sopapillas on the table. If you're trying to pull off authentic New Mexican cuisine, you had better deliver some sopas with the main course. Sure, I could have spent an extra $6 on their weird sopapilla desserts, but I'm no sucker. 

If I go back with different (not lower) expectations, Los Dos might get a 4-star rating. The green chile salsa was tasty. Also, I suspect their adovada ribs are worth a try.Scale of 1-10 (single visit):

I thought the food was pretty good.  I love the egg-on-top thing New Mexican restaurants do.  The blue corn tortilla of my enchiladas was thick and good.  But the marg was bad.  Tasted like sweet and sour.  No bite whatsoever, and I'm pretty sure it came out of a machine (rocks), instead of hand made.  Also the salsa wasn't anything special.  It had some nice heat, but just average flavors.I've had they're thin crust pizza a couple of times. It's actually pretty good!! Good pizza is very hard to come by in Vegas so I'll def keep ordering from this place since it's close to my work!! The crust and their toppings are super yummy.  The sauce is very mediocre in my opinion. I would def recommend it if you're near that area but don't go out of your way to go there. I'll try some more of their other options next time. maybe i'll re- review it!!I've been to several Tommy's locations in So. Cal., this location is not anywhere near their efficiency. That said, the food quality was virtually identical, it simply took quite a bit longer to arrive.I was seriously disappointed in my dining experience at Roka. I went with a group of 18 and had arranged to have a fixed menu and reserved the back room. 

The food was as excellent as all of the other reviewers stated. We sampled several rolls, veggies, soup, sashimi, tempura ect.   The place itself big, with modern tasteful décor, and the tables were nicely spread out. They have a huge sushi and robata bar and a lounge to the side with all different seating arrangements. The back room we were placed in was big but intimate enough for our group. Our server was exceptional (his name was Casey) he was quick to offer suggestions and really knew the history of the drinks. If I had a restaurant I would steal him away and put him as head waiter!

So why the 3 stars? Timing, or in this case lack of timing. 

We were seated and brought the first round of rolls before our drink orders had been placed.
We actually received 4 orders of rolls before we received our drinks. 
We were served drinks without sake cups, soups without spoons, rolls without soy or wasabi... 
It was a complete mess. I am sad to say the lack of timing really disappointed us, I would return because the food and service were excellent, but I would not recommend it for big groups.

One more thing - They offered to call us a car service to take us to downtown Scottsdale, telling us the fist 10 miles were free. Once we got in the driver told us it was a minimum charge of $25. They really need more organization.When you walk into Roka Akor, you know you're in a trendy upscale Japanese restaurant.  With the robata grill cranky out delicious chared meats, and the sushi line shouting greetings, you are immediately drawn into this restaurant.  The wait staff was very attentive and explained each dish with such detail and excitement.  We ordered:

Kobe beef and Kimchi dumplings: Other yelpers raved about this dish but to us it was pretty bland.  Needed more kick perhaps
Hamachi tataki: Delicious.  Light and very clean flavors
Rock Shrimp: Also very good.  Our favorite dish of the night
Dynamite Roll: It was a mushy experience in the mouth and the scallops masked the crab and avocado.  
Spicy Tuna: Average.  
Hamachi Serrano Chili roll: Also bland, especially when you read Serrano chilis!  
Hamachi sashimi: Hamachi was fresh and delicious.  But expensive for 2 small pieces.  

Overall: The place was good, but left something still to be desired.  On the pricier side for sushi and the portions are definitely small so do not come starving!Went to Roka Akor on a Wednesday night for a birthday dinner.  The place was packed and we didn't have a reservation.  I asked if we could be seated and they said no.  I went to my car and went on Open Table and I could have the pick of time that night.  So we left but when I called Roka Akor the next day the gal said yes we would have seated you had you booked through Open Table even though we had nothing open if I just walked in.  Even with this bad experience the food is excellent!Oyshi's AYCE sushi experience is kind of, well, meh.  It is neither exciting nor disappointing.  I felt that the fish to rice ratio on the nigiri was a little rice-happy.  The rolls were not too exciting.  I would go back, but only if someone else insisted.This is the Capriotti's I frequent most often, so imagine my surprise when I went to a different location and they had wheat bread. Hands down, no questions asked, I always prefer wheat to white. I just thought Cap's didn't offer that option. Nope, THIS Cap's doesn't offer that option. Besides that, this a good location. The service here is always both fast and courteous. For a sandwich shop they actually have quite a few vegetarian options other than the usual "veggie sub." You just have to be willing to eat faux meat in the form of soy products. Which, I am not willing to do, but thought it was an interesting option all the same.Good service, but this one is always so busyThe Girlfriend and I came here for breakfast after a night stay there in the Hooters Hotel and Casino. Dan Marino's is located in the Hooters Hotel and  serves breakfast till 12pm. We chose the breakfast buffet because we received a coupon book with a coupon for a 2 for 1 buffet meal when we signed up for the free players club card. Regular price of buffet, $10. Buffet consist of all the basic breakfast goods. Scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage links and patties, diced potatoes and dry cereal. They also had waffles with strawberries as choice for topping. The waffles weren't too bad, tasted more like a thick pancake though.  There was even a bread pudding sort of kinda thing. Oh and fruit, can't forget the fruit. Watermelon, cantelope, pineapple, orange and pink grapefruit slices. Buffett meals include coffee,milk, oj or soda. All in all it was a good bargin and good food.Just had dinner here while staying at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge for a conference.  

Short take: overall it was a pleasant and good experience.  I'd come back if I lived in the area and if I didn't mind spending a few bucks.  

Details: The hostesses and wait staff were great; seated me promptly and were able to engage in some nice small talk to get me comfortable.  The dining area was pleasant.  It has some massive stone columns that break the room into somewhat smaller seating areas, making for a cozier dining experience and also helps to shield from noise.  The seats were comfortable, and the table plenty big for a party of two--unlike some other restaurants that really try to cram you into as small of a footprint as possible.  So far so good.

Now onto the important stuff: the food and pricing.  The food I got was excellent.  The portions, however, are small.  Luckily for me, they surprised me with a bread board and a couple of other things (unexpected dungeness crab salad mini-bite, and end-of-meal white chocolate truffle).  The bread wasn't the usual bread and olive oil dipping sauce that I'm accustomed to getting at lesser restaurants, but a board with three types of warm artisan bread: a cranberry, a plain sourdough, and a nice green olive encrusted bread.  Six slices in total, I ate all of them.  It would have been a little dry normally, but 4 (count 'em, 4) different spreads and dips made them very edible.  They had an olive oil dip, a buttery spread, a tangy blended mayonnaise dip, and some cooked and oiled cored olive topping dish.  It was a delight to mix and match the types of bread with the types of options.  

I started with a caesar salad.  This was pretty good, but you can't really go too far with a caesar.  I've had plenty worse, so I'm sure you get the picture.  I was disappointed by the size though, it was a small soup bowl size (for $10!).  At least there were two fresh anchovies in there.

For the main entree, I ordered their veal ravioli.  This was delicious.  The skin was just right, the meat was tender.  The sauce was a creamy delight, and there was also a secondary plating of a deep green colored sauce that neither added nor subtracted from the taste or texture of the dish.  What was a little weird was the prosciutto they haphazardly tossed on top of it all.  No complaints though, I chopped that up and it added a little extra kick.  In total there were only about eight 1.5" square sized ravioli; plumply stuffed, but a couple more would have been nice...  

One person, no wine, no dessert, no coffee--just iced tea, a salad, and ravioli, and I was up to $41.  I wouldn't have been full without the bread.  If the price was a little lower, say $30-35, I would have given them an extra star.I thought it was a nice enough buffet. We got a deal through Southwest that included a free buffet everyday we were staying at any MGM property, and since we were here, we tried it out for breakfast and lunch. It is sort of in the basement, but it's cool.

They have a pretty good spread. Breakfast had eggs, burritos, sausage etc, but they also have crepes, biscuits and gravy etc. I was happy with the spread. They keep the salad bar open as well and have a few Greek dishes too.

Lunch brings out chicken, noodles, Asian food, pasta and the same Greek food. 

Overall, it was filling and had enough choices. Definitely glad I tried it, but there are more buffets out there to try.

If you're staying at the Luxor, worth trying.Ouch - 2 stars seems a bit harsh.

We had the buffet at the Luxor on the last day of our trip for convenience as we would be leaving right after lunch.
Breakfast was probably the weakest showing, with limited options and underwhelming execution.  All the standards were available: Eggs, meats, breads, potatoes, pancakes, etc.  But nothing was awesome.  I'm a big biscuits and gravy guy, so when the biscuits were small and dry and the gravy didn't have much flavor, I was bummed.  Coffee was good though :)

Lunch was a bit of redemption.  Much wider variety:  Mexican, Asian, Pasta, Greek, American, etc.  Nearly everything I tried from the lunch buffet was tasty.  I specifically recall the vegetable spring rolls being really good.  The star may have been the dessert - Chocolate Molten Lava "cake", which was basically a pan of chocolate cake, fudge filling, graham crackers, and marshmallow.  
You can't beat the value and if you're looking to stick close to the Luxor, you could probably do much worse.It's a really good deal for the sushi, appetizers, and dessert if you get the AYCE. The happy hour deal for 50% off sushi also seems pretty good too. Everything we ordered was tasty but the rolls had way too much sauce on them. I'm not sure what the name of the sauce is but it was the sweet sauce that's usually on unagi. I would have given this place 4 starsif they would just go easy on the sauce. A lot of the rolls seems very similar so I wish that they had more variety.Is this a former Taco Bell?  Anyway, after the hype dies down I think this will be a place that I add to my mix of breakfast spots.  We waited about 30 minutes for a tiny little space at the counter, but this seemed reasonable, as the crowd waiting outside was smaller than we'd ever seen.  I had an egg white omelet w/ wild mushrooms and hashbrowns and my dining companion had a different egg dish w/, get this, a side of Recess Pieces pancakes (yes, I had a bite and yes, they were really yummy)!  If you're not going for gourmet, the food won't disappoint.  As other reviewers have said, the coffee is very good.  The mix of Scottsdale hangovers and Arcadia church goers makes the people watching fun (if you're not seated in front of a brick wall) and the staff was charming - despite the craziness!I am happy to see more restaurants in the neighborhood, and I do like the retro decor... but I've only been here twice and it is right up the street from me.  I much prefer Acacia Cafe or LGO.  That's probably because I often go out to breakfast solo and do some reading or work.  This is not the kind of place where you feel comfortable just chilling by yourself.IMPOSTERS!!

I have been to NY, and Jersey, and this pizza does not compare AT ALL! First HUGE mistake.. they use CANNED mushrooms! Who does that? The crust is nice and crispy, but it's tough, and not tender. It's a problem with all pizza on the west coast... the water is too hard here. To get the real good crust like from Jersey, you'd have to use bottled water. 

The people were super nice, and the wings were decent. Hence the 3 stars, but the pizza... oh man, the pizza... they have a lot of improving to do. 

Also, it was a little pricey. I know they are small and family owned, so I contemplated even putting this on here. Cause I get it. They can't compete with all the pizza chain prices. And yes, they definitely were better than the Pizza Hut, or Domino's, but maybe next time I'll wait for a coupon or something...

Order of 12 wings, and a Pepperoni, Sausage & Mushroom Pizza = $28I probably have a more positive review than Stevey P. because I went in there with my 'nasty' radar turned up pretty high.  It's kind of like when you go to a movie expecting it to suck and when you get out of there you shrug your shoulders and think...well...it wasn't AS bad as I thought it would be.

I like to try new places just to mark them off my list and see for myself how it is.  So here's what I thought...

One of the differences I think was that we sat at a booth as opposed to the bar, so I can't say whether I would have liked my experience if I were at the bar.

While it was nice not to be ignored, the waitress was borderline over-attentive.  It's good to be attentive, but can be a little annoying if it's more than generally necessary.  She didn't seem to know much about the menu, but her saving grace was that she asked questions for us if she didn't know the answer instead of just dismissing us.

There's a pretty large menu of various dishes.  The appetizers weren't extremely appealing to me, and looked a little suspisciously like bar food.

Tried dishes:
**Green Corn Tamale and Chile Relleno including beans and rice.
The tamale was subtly sweet and extremely moist.  It was a pretty big size and probably one of the best Green Corn Tamales I've had in a long while.  However, if you don't like sweet tamales you won't like this one.  Fortunately, it was an excellent start to the meal for me.
The Chile was oozing with creamy cheese and cooked just perfectly.

**Steak Fajitas with rice
Really, it's kind of hard to mess up Fajitas.  But I will say the steak was cooked perfectly and had a great mesquite flavor.  The veggies on the side still had texture without being raw.
The guacamole that came on the side seemed to be freshly made.

The rice was probably one of the best I've had.  I don't like it when they add veggies in with the rice.  I just want rice.  And it wasn't crunchy.

The only real negative was the salsa that seemed store bought with fresh chopped cilantro thrown in just to fool you.

Summary--
One of the better Mexican restaurants in Surprise (I know that's not saying much but...) and it seems that sitting in a booth is much better than sitting at the bar.  I will probably go again at some point to see if the service and food is consistent or if it's a case of hit and miss.Caveat-I do not eat red meat.  I picked this place based on reviews and knowing that most of our party loves steak.  The staff were friendly and helpful but you have to wonder when your waiter doesn't know what grade the meat is and seemed confused by questions about the different cuts.  Nonetheless, our meals were all very good (I had halibut) and the salads & desserts were to die for. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and chose great wines or us.  All in all, while Morels didn't quite live up to the hype, it was delicious food in a beautiful setting and I would go again.Do I even need to state that I wanted Mexican food on this trip??  Ahhhh it's a sickness, I can't help it!  Actually, it's an addiction I never want to cure if you want me to be honest....

...::sigh::... stranded at South Point, really wanting Mexican food, chillin solo, I found this the perfect opportunity to try Baja Miguel's.  I was unsure of it because the last Mexican restaurant in here was pretty blaaaah.  However, I would never know how this one tasted unless I went.  Located towards the back of the casino and up the stairs, I finally found Baja Miguel's. 

"Oh it's just me ...::smiles::..." 
"Ok, the wait is 20 minutes." 
"What?! 20 minutes for ONE person??" 
"Yea" 
"...::sighs in disbelief::... alright I guess"

As I'm waiting, I see about eight of my friends coming out. Ahh why didn't you tell me yall foos were eating here?! ..::sad face as stomach growls::...

20 minutes roll around and I am finally seated..... at the first booth at the entrance. DANG I didn't want EVERYONE to know I was eating alone ...::starts texting to look occupied and as if I don't care::... A nice lady came and brought me chips, salsa, guacamole, and refried beans and took my drink order.  I really only like guacamole with taquitos so I just tried a bit.  The salsa was whatever, not the best I've had but certainly not the worse either.  My server came and I order tortilla soup FIRST and then the chicken enchilada with green sauce combo.  Yea, yea I got enchiladas, FTW!!!

My server comes back in about 15 minutes with my enchildas and it looks pretty good.  I look up to him and say: 

"My tortilla soup? :)"
"You ordered soup?"
"Yea I did ...::I actually ordered that first to be honest::..."
"...::looks at order receipt::... No you didn't, do you want it?"
"...::Yea I did::... oh alright, no that's ok then :/"

So to sum up my solo experience at Baja Miguel's, it just was what it was.  I would call it decent.  Enchiladas and beans were pretty good but the rice was bland and not so much.  Clearly not the best I've ever had. If you aren't staying at the South Point and have access to a car, USE IT!  if you're stranded like me and have a fixin for Mexican food, suck it up, Baja Miguel's will do.Solid 3 stars: great plae for nachos, beer and watching an NFL game. If you want a nice dinner and plan on paying full price (no coupons) skip it, although it is a good deal with a restaurant.com certificate.
Cocktails are weak and pricey, stick with cerveza.First impressions: Why am I in someone's garage?
Another psuedo-industrial "underground" decor coffee shop. Meh.
Is there some rule against having nice furnishings in order to be "edgy"?

Chairs and tables were functional but cheap. Molded plastic/fiberglass type chairs with metal legs, the kind of thing you'd expect in an "institutional" cafeteria from the 1970's.

Slooow! One person in line in front of me and it took nearly ten minutes to get my order taken. I'm more sympathetic to waits *after* my order has been taken, that way my bad hip and I don't have to stand in queue.

The drink came up quickly. They use the Monin brand chocolate syrup which (after trying at several different shops) I have decided is crap.

That said, the underlying coffee was smooth and very tasty! There was no metallic taste, which confirms my suspicion about the water at another shop that uses Cartel's roast.

Polite order taker and Very nice crema art by the barrista.

I'll have to try this location again for a drink without chocolate.A bunch of friends got together and headed off to Tempe Marketplace for the Gloriana concert. We were all hungry and my wife saw the "Happy Hour" sign so we all went into Genghis Grill.

There was no one at the front counter so we had to wait a few minutes for someone to help us. I have to say the food smelled great. We went to the line to build our orders. My wife asked one of the employees preparing the meals, which one of the sauces had pineapple juice in them. His response was that he did not know for sure, but he did not think that any had pineapple juice in them. In other words he was just guessing. If my wife has pineapple juice, someone needs to call 911. I tried to explain to the employee, that knowing for sure was really important. We finally got him to go in the back and get the ingredient list for the sauces. The one specifically she was asking about has pineapple juice in it. Things could have gotten bad really fast had she ingested that sauce.

I hate to write a review like this, the food was really good, the service was really bad. 

I liked the food so much that even with the bad service, i wanted to buy some gift cards for gifts, I waited and waited for the cards, then when I got the acting manager to sell me the cards, he told me that they have a promotion, if you buy a $25 gift card, you get a $5 card for free, I thought that was a nice bonus. Then he told me that I would need to come back tomorrow and talk to a Manger, because he did not have access to those cards. 

The servers had no direction in what they were doing, the place was way understaffed, which made for a less than great dining experience. I learned as I was leaving, that the management was all at a wedding and that they did not think it was going to be a busy night...They thought wrong.

Shame on the management for doing that to the servers. 

In closing I have to say the food was really good, the service was really bad. Talking to a few of my friends, they had the same experience there, where it seemed like the place was understaffed.

I want to give it 2 stars, but I really thought the food tasted good.I visited the museum last month with some out of town guests and we stopped in to Arcadia Farms Cafe. It was pretty convenient since we got hungry mid trip, but I probably wouldn't eat here again unless I was presented with a similar situation. 

They pre-make all of the food, so you cannot really pick and choose what you want. When I am paying $12 for a quesedilla, I like to be able to say NO MUSHROOMS. But I digress. 

They did have a really, really tasty apricot iced tea. Normally I stick to plain iced tea, but I was feeling adventurous this day and I am glad I tried it. 

There is also a really tasty hummus. I think it has cilantro in it because it has a little zing. 

The server was pretty unfriendly, but she gave good service so I won't complain. 

Overall the food was good, but not worth the expensive prices and inability to be special.Really good food.  I had the Strawberry Chicken Salad.  It looked so fresh and delicious! I should have taken a picture.  The poppy dressing was light and there wasn't too much of it either. I tried their apricot iced tea.  It was okay, nothing special in my opinion. 

The menu was really great and I was impressed with the wine selection. I am really excited to come back and try all the other tasty food! 

Why did I dock them a star? A couple of reasons:
1. NO art on the walls!  We are in the frickin Phoenix Art Museum people.  This should be a place to constantly exhibit art.  I've been in the store rooms, there is a ton of art that could be shown here.  Even better, allow local artists to display.
2. It took 20 minutes to get our orders taken, 30 minutes to recieve our food and another 15 to get the bill.  Although our server was polite, the entire experience took much too long.  This is a place for a leisurely meal. keep that in mind.First we got seated across the hall in a cigarette smoke filled room.  We then asked to move and got seated in the main room. This was much nicer and no smoke.  Then we got the car sales man guy that talked so fast, we didn't understand the specials.  Almost all the food was salty. Steak was good like other high end steak houses (Peter Luger, Primehouse, Grill 23, DK Steakhouse, Hys).A unique burger joint with a humorous experience.
Didn't go for the food, went for the experience.

I walked in and grabbed a seat at the bar.
The friendly head nurse gives you a admittance bracelet and dresses you in a hospital gown.
There are creepy manequins standing around the restaurant.
The head nurse told me she did shots off one of the guy surgeon manequins LOL.

A really hot waitress dressed in a super tight nurse costume showing lots of cleavage and lots of legs.

Small menu to choose from.
As I don't eat beef, here is what I chose:

1.83 all you can eat fries... cooked in lard
4.55 30 oz butterfat strawberry shake.

The fries are usually fresh cooked and pretty good.
The Shake,... it was very sweet, not the best thing I had but I enjoyed about 2/3 of it and then had to leave it because I was getting headache and dehydration.

I saw my man finish the quadruple bypass (four patties ewww).
He got wheeled out to the car by the head nurse.
His opinion: Very greasy, not the most flavorful.

Friendly service. The staff is all dressed up. and You're required to wear hospital gowns like a patient lol

There's entertaining stuff on the TV, stuff related to their restaurant.
Local culture presented in a fun fashion.

This place is humorous, worth going to for the experience at least once... 

but expect to crave some salad or some fruits/veggies afterwards cuz the grease/fat content will make you feel icky.I've been shopping at Costco for years, and it's probably one of my favorite places to go.  They have a little bit of everything, and I can usually find what I need here. But, this location itself seems to make me sad and depressed, for a variety of reasons. It's just not my favorite store. I'll tell you why.

For starters, The reason I have it 3 stars instead of 5 is the staff.  They aren't rude, but I've had better service. I usually hit the customer service counter every so often, and that's where I feel like I've gotten the blow off.  A handful of times I went there because they didn't send me my coupon book to know what's on sale.  I will usually go to the counter and grab a book so I can add or subtract from my shopping list depending on what I need and what's on sale.  

One time I asked the girl about the coupon books because I still don't get them in the mail and she didn't have any at the counter. Her response?  "well, we can't guarantee that you get a coupon book and we don't have any here at the counter.  Sorry, you need to look online."  She didn't even make an effort to check my account, inform me of when a new set will come in, or anything.  She continued on with her paperwork and that was that.

Look, I'm not a stickler about it, but in years past Costco has been pretty good about mailing me coupon books so I know whats on sale that month. If I don't get one, I grab one at the counter. If push comes to shove, the people will usually look it up to make sure my address is current to ensure that it's getting to the right address. Apparently, not here!  I guess it's to much work for them!

I've had other similar situations with the staff here as well, kind of getting the blowoff.  Another time I went to print some pictures and their photo machine went down.  3 days later the guy told me that I'm better off sending them to another location.  I asked if he could forward the pictures to the Deer Valley store, and he said that he wasn't able to do that, so I need to go home and upload them to that stores machine from my home computer.  I'm not suggesting that he's lying, but I just am so irritated that I had to wait 3 days to figure this out. I would call, and they would say the machines under repair and home to be back online by 5.  Then, it wasn't and they kept me waiting and calling until the guy finally called me at home and told me that it looks like its going to be a little bit longer before it's fixed and to resubmit.

Overall, I love Costco, but this store just isn't my favorite. Plus, sometimes the bathrooms have been in disrepair with at least one toilet out of service, if not more.  Yes, they are clean and well maintained, but something's always out of service when I'm in there. Either a toilet or two, a sink is down, something.  I still go here because its closet to home and easy to get to, and overall it's not that horribly bad.  Just a mediocre staff with some minor flaws, that's all.When you're drunk the pizza here is pretty amazing (and they have several varieties!). When you're not drunk, it's okay, but really not all that great. The later part of that statement I only know from a single visit. The first part I know from several visits when I'm back visiting AZ. 

Apparently, they serve other things besides pizza and they they are open at other times besides the hours of midnight to 2 am on the weekends. I wouldn't know anything about that though.I came here solely for their pizza. My brother kept begging to get a Costco pizza for weeks until I finally gave in. I haven't had one of these pizzas in years! I remember when I was still living at home in San Diego and my parents thought this was better than Pizza Hut! 

Since I never personally ordered one I felt like a dummy because I was giving them my toppings of choice then the cashier was like "no". I didn't really understand why I couldn't have pineapples, jalapeno , onion and mushrooms on my pizza so I tried again . Then she says they only make supreme, pepperoni, and cheese. I tried to customize the supreme by saying please no mushrooms or black olives (husband is picky) then the cashier explained that the toppings are all pre mixed . That is how they keep the prices down. I was like, "Oh okay" (felt like an idiot) so we decided on the supreme. 

While I was waiting I had one of their hot dog combos. I can't get tired of those!  It was delicious! I finally had a taste of the pizza after all of these years and it tasted fine. It was a good deal for like $10.00.In a town of the mediocre sandwich, this is a good sandwich for vegas - but far from a great sandwich from SF, LA, Chicago or New York.  Don't get over hiped like I did reading reviews that give them 4-5 stars - I can only imagine, these reviewers have never had a really good sandwich.

Bread is usually just ok - they almost always taste a bit too old and dry.  quality of meat and ingredients are good and service is ok.  I can't wait to find that great sandwich here in vegas...  until then, I'll keep dreamingThis place has closed downSometimes you just dont get what you pay for. Like paying nearly 5 bucks for a large frozen yogurt and getting a less then half full cup. Then a buck for the first topping which was so stingy. I chose mochi and seriously, there were about 6 pieces. Were not talking quality over quantity here.. the frozen yogurt was good, very light sour yogurt taste, not much tang. I make the same recipe at home and its good but not 6 bucks a cup good. Maybe the lady there at Chill saw my fat ass and decided that she needed to put me on a diet! 

I did have a taste of the gelato and thought it was really good.. I think if I go here again I will certainly stick with the gelato.. seems that those cups are literally packed. You live you learn.Decent sandwiches all around $7.  Good place for lunch."THE ROCK! THE ROCK! THE ROCK IS ON FIRE! WE DONT NEED NO WATER, LET THE M**********R BURN! BURN M**********R BURN!"

Ok so I got a little bit bored watching this. When it first starts, you hear some sort of Hawaiian tribal music. Then the water surrounding the volcano starts to bubble. Then small flames start coming out of various places. For the next 8 minutes or so things start getting bigger and louder until it culminates into a big bang. Then all is quiet again until the next hour all the way to midnight. The start time was at 5 pm last time I looked but sometimes they change it.

Now if I was in control of things, I would play music associated with fire. "Come on baby light my fire", "This girl is on fire", and any other song that involves fire would be playing. Heck, I would even hire a DJ to spin mixes in between each show. At the end of the show, I would have water sprinkle the crowd a bit during the hot summer months.

It's a decent free show. Definitely better than the Pirate show next door, which I gave 1 star.In a hurry in the Phoenix airport and saw Blue Burrito Grille. Ordered the Big Blue Burrito with pork. Unlike a previous reviewer, I got a LARGE burrito with plenty of fillings including some very tasty pork. The salsa was also very good. Their website says that the burritos come with chips and there was a huge bin of them on the counter but alas my burrito came sans chips... which I didn't notice until after I was on the airplane. A good place for a quick Mexican lunch but make sure you get the chips.Friendly place with decent beer selection. Just don't believe the hype on the burgers and Philly cheesesteaks. Both were dry, not juicy, and just not that good.I really wanted to be a fan but I think the ambiance killed it. It was too freakin' dark. What annoys me the most about fine dining is when I can't see the food I'm eating. 

Anyways, my husband ordered the Ribeye which was on par with Gallagher's at NYNY and my Braised Short ribs was flavorful with Indian spices. We ordered other food but it wasn't spectacular. Good but not palate changing. Did it look good? I think so but again, IT WAS DARK! 

Would I come back? No, but I would try the Beverly Hills outpost. CUT in Las Vegas was a dud.has anyone else played Diner Dash?

i had the music and images of my finger dragging customers to tables, taking orders, and delivering food. two waitresses and servers for a restaurant of 10-12 tables and a handful of sushi bar spots. for some tables -- like ours --i could see the smoke coming out of our ears as we were waiting to order! 

but i digress.

for phoenix, four stars. lumped into sushi restaurants as a whole, 3 stars. 

excellent value for money (45 piece sashimi platter for $45 is your best bet) and mostly fresh fish. some cuts of fish were better than others, but in general, i did have to drown them in wasabi to cut the taste of fishi-ness. you will be spoiled for choice with the sushi roll menu, and their servings are generous. nothing super memorable. 

i might go back if i had a super sushi craving.Good fast dependable.  Not the most authentic, but it's at Park Central, what did you expect?  Given the choices there, I'd happily go to Thai Basil over the Good Egg or Starbucks.Show: Its Pussy Cat Dolls meets Pirates of the caribbean! Well sort of...Unfortunately I watched this show from my hotel room, haha. From my view there were alot of cool special effects, dancing and singing. The second night my dad and I attempted to get a good view outside near the ship but there were SO MANY people. We couldn't even get onto the Vip section for Treasure Island guests. If you don't get there early for a good view, forget it.

Location: Located right in front of Treasure Island, you can't miss it.

Price: FREE!We each ordered a pair of al pastor tacos topped with cilantro, pineapple and onion with a squeeze of lime plus taco chips and black beans. The weather was so pleasant we ended up dining on the patio.  I would rate our meal 3.5 Stars.A recent visit to celebrate a friend's birthday, Yard House left me feeling disappointed.  We had a large party, about 14 people at the table.  During our visit, we even had a shift change, where our original waitress was kind enough to let us know she was leaving and who was taking over.  

Although the rest of our table had appetizers, The Husband and I arrived in time for entrees:

* New York Steak Salad "green beans, roasted peppers, avocado, crispy potatoes, red onion and baby lettuce tossed in a gorgonzola vinaigrette with beefsteak tomatoes and pickled egg" ($16.95) - A generous and flavorful salad, loaded with the ingredients listed and a tasty steak.

* Cuban Roast Pork Dip "tomatoes, pepper jack cheese, pickles, dijon and garlic aioli on french bread grilled with bbq au jus" ($12.65) - This was The Husband's order and I had a bite.  It wasn't that great, especially when I recall my previous experience with a Cuban sandwich.  The fries were good though.

My concern was more with service.  The waiter asked the birthday girl what kind of dessert she wanted (out of three choices), and she went for the Chocolate Souffle Cake "mini serving with vanilla ice cream, served warm".  When it arrived, there was no candle which surprised us all.  (How are you supposed to sing happy birthday without a candle to blow?)  And he only gave us one spoon, which reminded me that he never brought back dessert menus for the rest of us.  At this point, we didn't bother ordering dessert since the birthday girl already had hers.  That part made the experience disappointing.

The other waiter was able to do a split tender on the check, which was helpful.  (Although he put the costs wrong on my receipt, oh well.)  I usually think Yard House is on top of things, but I guess they weren't that night.It's an upper scale Applebees decent across the board. Been to the town square and red rock locations, both decent. It's not a bad choice, but not the best...I have been here twice now, and both times felt that the food and service is mediocre. The fish tacos are not good and expensive, the crab enchiladas are fair but again, more than i would like to spend on enchiladas. 

The drinks are great, and its the only bar I've ever seen to have Negro Modelo on tap. 

In summary: Go for draft Mexican beer or Mojitos, go elsewhere for dinner.Best Feature: Ambiance

I'm gonna have to be brutally honest with you, Mill Avenue is not the coolest place in Tempe.  In the old days, Mill was more of a bohemian paradise, with hippie street performers, people walking in the street and a cookie shop that opened it's doors and wafted the smell of cookies through the air.

Today, the Mill Avenue District (Isn't "District" a bit lofty of a word to describe a two mile strip on one street?) has been more commercialized.  Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing - look at 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica, that's commercial and fun.  But Mill is home to several bars, 3 clothing stores and a mixture of expensive and inexpensive restaurants.  If they had truly thought out their expansion, they would have branched out a while ago and made an "arts district" a "shopping district" etc.  As it its now, they have no idea what it's supposed to be, but they slapped the "Mill Avenue District" name on it to give people the feeling they're living in a real city.

Mill's real problem now is that the buildings are too expensive for anyone not representing a giant company to afford.  Even if they somehow afford one, the rent and the lack of people buying things usually drives them in the ground (Swell Clothing RIP).

However, Mill is not without it's merits.  If you ARE looking for a place to get drunk, it's very convenient, especially for ASU students.  Slices is a great no nonsense pizza by the slice joint.  Occasionally, there are events like the Arts Festival, which end up being fun.

Overall, Mill is better than nothing, but it's got a long way to go.stopped by tonight while in the area.  sitting in a strip-mall with a few restaurants the packing lot was PACKED, but the place itself was fine.  

I got Spanakopita and a Gyro.  The Gyro was VERY tasty, packed with meat (could have had a bit more tzatziki though).  It was also a bit greasier than i am use to for a Gyro but i still enjoyed it.  The Spanakopita was also very good (but greasy).  

i'm sure i'll go back if in the area and can't think of anything else to get, but won't go out of my way.I got the meat sampler here and like Eric M. said it was a skillet of grease with lots of meat on top. The BBQ sauce is good and the meat was good but greasy. I don't like cornbread with the peppers in it, its sick and whoever thought it was a good idea needs to re-evaluate their life. I like normal cornbread, not cornbread with random crap in it. I prefer Joe's Real BBQ any day.Dear Sarah G,

Thank you for the suggesting we go to Paradise cafe. I tried the cookies and they were A-OK. Perhaps it is time to return for a 6th try?

Sincerely,

Jenn H

Now back to my regularly scheduled review of Paradise Bakery:

First of all... WHY THE CRAP WAS IT SO COLD IN THERE? Even my poor little Yelp hoodie couldn't keep me warm. I ordered soup - SOUP in July! - to keep me warm and that did not work. Perhaps that is because the soup was made out of a melted salt lick. 

But that's another issue.
 
Oh...

My salad was dope 

They have Fresca in the soda fountain (Yes!)

They gave me a free cookie

3 different types of iced tea 

The bathroom was very clean 

Free internet rocks 

But if you intend to eat here bring a snow suit. 

Or possibly a snow suit, pile of blankets, ear muffs and a space heater.

Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Still shivering.The service here was great, the ambiance was lovely, and it has all the makings of a really solid restaurant. I went here with a large group from work, and we had a sort of family style tasting. A few of the dishes were done very well. Fantastic lemon chicken, and I'm not normally a lemon chicken fan. It was very light, flavorful, and not so sweet as it often is. However, in several cases, the food just doesn't live up to the potential, and what can and should be a 4-4.5 star restaurant is stalling out for me at 3 stars. Please note, I didn't comment on any dishes that were fine, but not standouts to the positive or negative. We tried a lot of food. 

The yellowtail sashimi w/ cerrano follows the time tested formula, but the cerrano chile is cut too thick for the delicate yellowtail, and makes it difficult to appreciate the fish. The Peking Duck profiterole is misnamed. There was no crispy skin, and didn't get the true flavors of Peking Duck. The dish was dry, and lacking in flavor. The tempura calamari with salt and pepper was very tasty, and had a very good balance. The pan seared rare tuna with wasabi soy was disturbing. It tasted butter poached, and the butter was so overpowering, the fish taste disappeared. The wasabi soy dipping sauce some how was very flat in flavor, and even something that should be potent like wasabi soy was completely missing punch. The cod with lemon garlic was also a very odd flavor profile, though the fish was well cooked. I'm not sure if I had issues with the naming constructs as the dishes didn't match the flavors that should be connected to the names, or that it tasted like the restaurant was catering so much to the western palate that it actually lost the Asian flavors. It feels like it needs an adjustment to get where it needs to be.3 stars for free chocolate. 

I mean, the tour can be interesting and all (look, chocolate molds) but seriously, the reason you come here is for free chocolate. 

It's a very short tour which starts in a gift shop, ends with a free chocolate sample and then the chocolate shop. However, if you are polite, you can often charm free samples from the women working the counter. I tried a whole bunch of the other chocolates before buying a small pack. One thing I loved was the lemon caramel, but I can't seem to find it anymore. Sigh. 

It's not something you must do while in Vegas, but if you have the time, why not?Honestly, I (like an earlier review) am a bit disappointed in the other reviews that came before.  I feel a bit misled.  While the environment was nice, I'm not sure I would come back.

For $75 prix fixe per person I expected much more.  We had the Valentine's day menu and it was very mediocre.  The dishes, as described, had a lot potential, and the presentation was nice, but the quality was not up to par.

Here's a quick 30 second rundown:
The spinach salad was good.
The bisque was too salty.
The duck was chewy.
The fish had a nice texture and flavor.
The tenderloin was good, but the short ribs were too salty.
The lamb was decent but not sure they were the best cuts.
The dessert was ok- didn't finish it, and we almost always do.I am giving it 3 stars for the ambiance - It's all outside, volleyball and cornhole, a view of a baseball field. You could probably even go barefoot. But they were very slow bringing out food and drink. Also, they have TV'S outside, but most are broken! The biggest problem is that they have no beers on tap! Really?! Who goes to a bar for bottled beer? Great bones but poorly executed...Well of course men would like this place and rate it highly. I actually had a good conversation w/ the barista. She was nice and my vanilla latte was pretty good. However, it's no Ice Blended Vanilla Latte from Coffee Bean. I guess if I was good enough/met the criteria to work there, I may just work there for an ego boost.

I just don't like the fact that women are constantly objectified and their worth based on their physical "assets" or lack thereof. Anyone can dress up like that. I wouldn't expect anything less from Vegas.I like the location near the zoo, the atmosphere and room is nice with an outside eating area.   I've only been here once but I was disappointed with the pita panini I ordered.   It was quite large with a large slice of turkey and some cheese in the middle.  It just wasn't that flavorful and the whole thing was less than 1 inch thick.  It was adequate but I would never order it again.  The soup was fine but also nothing to write home about.  
I will probably stop by again sometime and try something else.   The turkey panini really needs improvement.  I want it thicker with thicker pita and maybe some sprouts.  Layer the turkey and maybe do some other flavor things with it.My dad and I were looking for a place to grab dinner. After reading the outstanding Yelp reviews and seeing the Yelp Check-In offer, we decided to check out Pizza Brutta.

We walked in and my first impression was, "Holy crap, there are a ton of kids in here!" It was Tuesday night around 6:00pm...is this when every family in the Vilas neighborhood goes out for dinner? Anyhow, we figured out quickly that you order at the counter. We walked up and saw the menu items on the board above the register, but there were no descriptions of each item. I then saw the menus on the counter and grabbed one. 

We decided to try the salami e funghi pizza and the Finocchio (crushed tomato, oregano, pepper flakes, fennel sausage, green olives, red onion, fontina, fresh mozzarella, and we added banana peppers), plus the free check-in brutta salad (spring greens with an olive oil/balsamic dressing). The salad came out quickly and was tasty. The pizza came out shortly thereafter. 

I picked up the first slice, the pizza flopped over, and half of the toppings fell off. WTF? I thought thin crust was supposed to be crispy, or at least firmer, especially when using a brick oven. So I had to use a fork to eat about half of the piece, until I could pick it up. This was my biggest qualm about the place. 

The pizza was good, toppings were fresh and abundant, the sausage was outstanding. The staff was super friendly. I'd love to try some of their other menu options. Lots of interesting pizza topping combinations and the beet salad looked amazing! I'll definitely go back, but maybe next time I'll ask for the pizza to be cooked well-done.Ok this is just my review and my comedy style is  more Dane Cook than bring your kids along. I always feel bad when I'm getting buzzed sipping on my $20 4 shot rum and coke in my souvenir cup, and there's an adorable 5 or six year old girl in front of us dancing to the songs with her parents and sisters. 4 of us went.. 2 in their golden years and two in their 30's. Two said they loved the show and two said meh. Terry Fator has talent for sure but it's lacking real comedy. So here's to you souvenir rummy cup for making the show bearable. If your looking for a PG / PG-13 show to take the family to then this could work for you. Me? I'll let sesame stree handle the puppets and Dane Cook handle the comedy.. Just my opinionMy parents and I saw Terry Fator a few years ago and really enjoyed it. So much that this year, we took my husband and best friend as well. I was pretty disappointed, as now it's obvious that Terry has a platform and is determined to use it. 

First off, the ventriloquism is great. It's truly impressive that he can sing as well as he does without moving his lips. The jokes are about 70% funny, some very funny and some a bit lame. I enjoy the singing and impressions immensely. If the show was just these things, I'd give 4 or 5 stars to the performance. 

Now...the one star. Terry now includes three original songs in his show. The first song, a country number, okay, not good, but at least lively. During the middle of the show, Terry launches into preachy sermon time. The song about Horses in Heaven was just a terrible song on its own. But also, the mood was completely dampened by the story about kids with cancer. Seriously? I felt duped and my sense of fairness was outraged. We bought tickets for a funny ventriloquism show, and now I'm being preached at? This segment lasted a long time, and continued with a celebration of the military (fine) and another cheesy, badly written song.  Definitely a damper on the mood. I give this part 1 star, so it evens out to 3 stars. 

Too bad. We won't be going back.I enjoy their home style cooking foods (even though their high cholesterol and not really healthy), but I completely disagree with their stance on gay rights. They're homophobic and have a huge sign when you go in that they support family values, etc.... but gay rights is clearly missing. Now, believe me, when I go there I go for the food. I have friends I'd be embarrassed to tell I have been there recently. My 8 year old was with her mother for Thanksgiving this year so I wanted to take her to brunch before I had to drop her off. Cracker Barrel was one of the only tasty places open. Wow, Thanksgiving morning at Cracker Barrel is a beast. They have this turkey deal that all the people wanted, but we just wanted breakfast. We waited an hour for a table and the Smokehouse Breakfast could've been smokier.Food tasted great, portion a bit small, service not so great, server gave us food w/o utensils even after a prior reminder.  Also brought my credit card slip w/o a pen.Stayed in a Resort King Suite. Mostly comfy...but for a hotel that bills itself as top of the line, there were lots of glitches. The 1st room they gave us had hair in the wash basin, hair on the pillows, toilet paper in the toilet, and visible stains on the sofa. They moved us to another room, and that one also had hair in the wash basin...hmmm.
View of the strip from the 51st floor were nice (we paid for the panoramic room upgrade). Room was spacious and comfy.
One annoying thing is they don't let you use the fridge in the room for your own items...we were warned that if you disturb any of the contents (either remove or add) that it might trigger a bar charge (from weight change sensors I guess).
Didn't like the fact that the hotel doesn't have adequate non-smoking areas in the casino or pathways to your room...so not a good choice for non-smokers like us. Also, there are better restaurant and shopping choices closer to the City Center/Bellagio area and the Wynn/Encore is a little out of the way. (I'm told the Vdara is a much better choice for non-smokers since it doesn't have a casino on-site and is a non-smoking property, and close to better shopping and restaurant selections).The good was pretty good - I would ask that they use the chicken pieces from the sweet and sour chicken for the lemon chicken - It alot more flavorful - The BBQ Pork Fried Rice is awesome - Overall great food for the area compared to Panda Express.First time visiting this location at Town Square. Most of the time when I walk by it is packed to the gills with people.... I don't know why it wasn't this time but since I didn't have to fight my way through a crowd I decided to give this place a shot.

Very pleasantly impressed. I loved all the variety of flavors and toppings, it was clean, and the staff was friendly. All a definite must when I am letting go of my hard earned dollars!!!  :)

Only down shot for me was the price... a bit steep in my opinion... but for an occasional tasty treat it definitely hit the spot!I love Thai food and I was really excited to try this place, and it was OK. The portions were nice and big we had the Tom Ka Gai (coconut milk Soup), Chicken Sate, Masumum Curry, and Gangari Curry. The soup was good, the Sate was also good. The curries were very watered down The Masumum even though it was watered down it was still good but the Gangari because of being watered down was lacking flavor. The server was very nice, and helpful. This place is ok for fast Thai food when you are am craving Thai and you just can't drive to the West side of town then this place is good enough to kill the craving. But unfortunately it is definitely not anywhere near the best Thai food in the Valley. But it was nice and I would return but unfortunately this one could not score any higher than a 3 for me. So I guess when I want the best Thai in the valley I still have to truck it to the west side. Oh well.Totally unimpressed with BLT Burger, as I was with Burger Bar. Perhaps it's because they're pretty hyped places and because I order classic burgers, but I would expect a flavorful, juicy patty of the finest beef at a place with these kinds of prices and such a famous chef. BLT Burger's classic burger was a thin, flavorless patty. The sweet potato fries were okay, but I've had far better, and they came with no dipping sauce like most places serve. The only good thing was the unique campfire marshmallow shake, with vanilla ice cream and chunks of toasted marshmallows. Service was just okay. The atmosphere is very nice - a cool space - but I won't be back to BLT Burger when I can get far better everything at places like The Counter in LA or Delux in Phoenix for far less money.Okay, vie been here about 3 times. 

I'm not very keen on irish foods. And i wasn't to impressed with the menu. I literally ordered chicken tenders and they came out looking like flat Mozillarella strips. I was like uh WTF is this. 
That and the lack of non irsh food on the menu was disappointing. 
Beer is good of course. 
The building is visually stunning i must admit. Service is great and they have a nice patio with bar in the rear. 

Prices are a tad high for me but if your willing to spend it then it's okay.Ah the old tangerine. No line and no cover on a thurs night. We did a quick in and out before heading upstairs to sleep. The layout is still the same as tangerine with the same type of music. They have all these douchebags in ed hardy gear passing out passes. Inside however, no ed hardy shirts around. The crowd was kinda B&T so we called it a night. It was a shame because the music was ok and there was actually space to dance. If you go to the bigger clubs like tao or pure, you will learn to appreciate dance floor space.While in Vegas last week, I got a sudden urge for some Banh Mi and Chicken Pho and of course, almighty Yelp led us to Lemongrass Cafe.

Yeah, yeah, the outside looks like a 50's diner, actually now that I think of it, it kind of resembled an oversized Streamline trailer.  But hey, who cares, you're there for the food, not to play Architectural Digest trivia.

Their menu was quite extensive as it had your basic Vietnamese and Thai offerings along with, Banh Mi...yay!  Talk about a perfect trifecta of Asian food!  So, I order my Chicken Pho and I shared the Combo Banh Mi with the s/o.  Pricing was a little bit on the high side compared to the Bay Area, my Pho was pushing $7 and the Banh Mi was $3.75.

Our Banh Mi took awhile to make, not sure why but when it came out, I was slightly disappointed.  It's thickness was mostly the bread's doing but it was also short but oh well.  I took a bite into it and the sandwich redeemed itself, it was quite delicious for such a small thing.  The bread was tasty, not sure if they bake it on site but it sure tasted like they did.  But, still disappointed about how small it was.  When it comes to Banh Mi, size certainly matters, the longer the better, right? ;)

My Chicken Pho was good, pretty basic, can't really mess it up.  However, my bowl had a lot of chicken.  Usually, my general complaint on most food I eat is how skimpy the meat is, well, not my bowl of Chicken Pho, it was loaded!

The staff was really friendly.  This one girl who was our server, whoa, talk about stewardess in the making!  She exerted such overwhelming friendliness, courtesy and hospitality.

Overall, Lemongrass Cafe was a decent place to eat and worth going to get your Viet/Thai/Banh Mi fix on!I'd have to be specifically craving Red Robin to eat at Red Robin. It's not the first place I think when I feel like burgers but when I'm on the Centennial Side of town & I don't feel like any other place, I end up here, just for the unlimited fries. LOL.

Service has been on & off for me at this location. It's not consistent, which is understandable. 

Oh & that bottomless Rootbeer Float. Mmmmm. You got me. Stop it. 

Overall though, I wouldn't say it's my favorite spot but food is alright & I'm okay with that.The food was pretty good but the service left a lot of room for improvement. We asked for water right away and didn't get it for 10 minutes,then I ordered the half salad and got the full ,she then offered to take it back and get the half , as I was already eating it I said no so I got charged for full. Asked for dressing on side. Didn't get that. Someone ordered fish and chips and asked to make sure there were no pickles or condiments on plate. It came with pickles and had to be sent back. I ordered Gaelic chicken with fettuccine. It came with mashed potatoes and had to be sent back. The other two waited to eat till corrections were made so their food was cold. Then when checks came someone was double charged! Come on train your waitresses!!!I mean, it's an apartment. your living with hundreds of people to not expect noise is beyond me, but im not that picky. With that said when I came to these apartments it just felt like home...i had been to other apartments in the area and this one just fit. I'm from LA and the urban style is the majority of apartments that you will find out there, so this place just seemed to fit. I will say that if you like the model you better speak up to management because there are a TON of different lay outs and you may be put into something you don't like. I am working with Anthony and he is the BEST he has worked with me to find exactly what I want and has be very helpful. I hope I still feel the same optimistic way in a yr, so Ill need to give an update after I have been here awhile.I usually am not interested in going to Jet when I'm in town but my friend had a hook-up for buy 2 bottles, get 1 free, so we decided to do it.  When I first walked up, I was so not impressed by the people standing in line...totally ghetto but there was a huge line.  It helps to be on the guest-list and/or do bottle service.  My group was pretty big with 8 guys and 4 girls.  With this ratio, to get in without waiting in line, we set it up so that the 8 guys were buying 2 bottles and we put the 4 girls on the guestlist to get in free.  Someone we knew, knows a bartender that was able to do that.  I don't know what the regular cost is for the 2 bottles but we did get one free on top of that.  In Vegas, you gotta ask around, network, make friends, etc to get the best deals/hook-ups.  Anyway, we all got in easily with this set-up.  Once inside, the club itself is decorated pretty nicely with candled walls, lights on the ceiling and stripper-poles throughout the dancefloor.  The space is medium sized, not small but not huge either.  The music was really good, a mix of Hip Hop and some House.  We got a table right next to the dancefloor.  Our bottle service girl was pretty friendly (they aren't always) and attentive, refilling the mixers, ice, and cups often.  Later in the night, she told my husband she could do buy one bottle, get one if we wanted more, so we did.  We got a second bottle of Jack ($450 plus tax + 20% gratuity).  In total, we bought 3 bottles and got 2 free, so 5 total.  More friends showed up, we got the two tables next to us since they opened up.  And ended up partying 25 people deep.  It was a good time.  

The place was totally packed, uncomfortably packed.  If we didn't have a table, I'd be pissed off.  The couple of times I walked to the bar and bathroom, I was squished to death.  The crowd is mostly 20-somethings, so it's a bit younger and all ethnicities.  My only gripe is that there were really nasty chicks on the stripper poles.  I thought the poles were going to break.  It was NOTcute!  So I docked a point because of janky people in this place.Went here for dinner while the wedding party enjoyed their Bachelor/Bachelorette dinner and drinks. After much anticipation I must admit I was a little disappointed in the overall experience.

We started with appetizers - Clams Casino for me and Beef Carpacchio for Carol. My clams were just average while the carpacchio was excellent. Entrees consisted of the stuffed Pork chop for me which was very good and Salmon for Carol which was just okay. We also ordered a side of fries - not sure why, since both our meals came with potatoes or rice. The fries, however, were excellent.

Our dinner was accompanied by a bottle of Clos Pegas, which was excellent.

All in all, a nice experience but not overwhelming. Prices were a little high for the portions and I felt the dining area was way too loud - maybe I'm just getting old.

Definitely will give it another try in the future.Great little place in downtown Kitchener for German cuisine.  They offer a small schnitzel plate but the portions are huge.   Good quality food and reasonable prices.I ordered a plate that was "thai hot".....it was hot.  Not bad but nothing special.  Will probably go back but will not go out of my way to go back.So...I'm in Vegas visiting my friend and we wanted some sushi..so I looked up some stuff on Yelp and found this place. We had good service, good beer and overall we enjoyed everything. The main problem I have with this place is that they use imitation crab in every roll except the soft shell crab rolls. ( I don't like soft shell crab so I guess I'm SOL) My friend didn't mind at all because she said that she can't tell the difference. I CAN tell the difference! I just don't get it!! Don't say it's crab if it's not crab!! WTF! You don't put fake tuna in your roll...so why put fake crab?? Anyway I do have to say although the crab was fake the rolls were still very good. I really liked the Wet Dream. We both agreed that it was our favorite. Overall the service was good, the rolls were pretty and good and the beers...also good.My friend thinks this place is the bomb but it has a limited sandwich type menu for lunch w average food.  The water view, though artificial, is still nicer than no view at all & it was nice to sit outside.  It was very quiet with 3 tables occupied for a Sunday brunch in October (when we did go) while it was still 75-80 degrees out.This is the first Fuddruckers in which I have dined that wasn't packed for dinner.  I never have trouble getting a seat and the staff is always friendly and quick. I have been eating at fuddruckers since 1985 or so when all they offered were burgers and the meat hung in a freezer at the door.  All you could put on the burgers was cheese and lettuce fixins. I remember the meet seemed fresher and bigger then.  The buns seem to be new and that is an improvement.  Not the best burger I ever had but more than serviceable and now there are many more choices including ELK, Buffalo, Ostrich, etc.  They offer toppings now including Mushrooms and bacon and different cheeses.  This is not a dieter's friend.  

The food is good, not great, the sides forgettable.  The cookies are tasty but the rest of the deserts are to be avoided.

Great place for the kids!My experience at Plaka was fine, but nothing to write home about. A friend and I shared the Moussaka and the Tilapia, and had a few of the hummus appetizers. The hummus and pitas were excellent. The tilapia was also nicely prepared and served with vegetables in a very basic preparation. While I have no frame of reference for Moussaka (it's sort of an eggplant lasagna) this tasted like something you could make at home, but not in that amazing home-cooked comfort food kind of way. Mostly it was just "meh". To top it off, our waitress was not super friendly and I felt like we were rushed to get out of the restaurant even though it was only 8:45 when we left.This is for the nightclub, not the restaurant.

I went here with ten other friends, five guys and six girls, over Memorial Day weekend. That was our first issue, never go during the holidays because you'll pay 200% more for everything that time...even though it doesn't change from the weekend before or after. Well, maybe it will be less crowded.

Anyways, we were the first ones in line for the guestlist. Girls were free, guys cover was $60. All the boys sucked it up and paid that amount. Since we were some of the first people in there, we took full advantage of the open bar. We snagged some drinks for our guy friends as well. 

Within the next hour, it got very crowded, since it is such a small venue. The music was a little outdated...early 2000's. We found a little spot between the VIP area and a walkway. It ended up getting way too crowded, that we decided to leave around 12-1230.

Like other people have said, it's a good place to start out at, but it's not a place that you'll stay all night at, unless you have a table and don't have to be smashed next to everyone else.Service Sucked! Super SUCKED!  Barside, on a Wednesday night.  

Now that that is out of the way, I really liked the place.  The chica in the knee-highs ignoring our table was annoying, but the happy hour specials were good, the food was great, the atomsphere was fun and the facilities were clean.  What more can you ask for.  Oh and the drinks were a little pricey but good pours.  

We will be back, now that I know which server to watch out for.Being that this place is inside the RIO, I'd say that they have a pretty captive audience - especially late at night. That being said, its still a decent little spot to eat at if you are staying here. I ended up staying at the Rio on some comped nights for the new years so I found myself here in need of some food to soak up the alcohol in the system late at night. Had tried a few different things from this place. The braised oxtail was good - but not nearly as good as the oxtail soup from the California casino in downtown - anyone who has eaten that late night, knows what I am talking about. One of the best anywhere. The Yang chow fried rice is really good and if you have some other dishes with rice already... getting the bbq pork without rice is a great option - its like twice as much to get it with rice! 

The only consideration is that if you are mobile and have a car... you are right near a huge Chinese food area on spring mountain road where you can get more bang for your buck. Then again... when you are in a casino, you already know that you are going to pay a little more and hopefully you have gambled enough to get some free food comps. 

Don't look for anything too fancy here... It's really like a cafeteria where you order and pick up your food and go sit down at an empty table to eat afterward.As in the one photo their sweet potato fries are sweet potato chips. They come with a delicious jam, but the chips are not stellar alone.  They sometimes are overcooked, not very "meaty" and some become more done than others.  One visit the oil needed changing, this could be tasted in the fries/chips themselves.  I'll still be back regardless.A nice, little buffet in the Silverton, it's great place to come with a prom or comp. Simple but effective menu~ somethings are really great and others are just typical or ok. Had not been here for awhile, but we saw an ad for bogo and decided to try again. Glad we did as they have a new executive chef who has revamped the menu and added some more interesting and fresh items. For example, the deep fried tofu salad with chilli and the keifer lime stir fry chicken. Can't go wrong with a selection of roasted vegetables (jalapenos and garlic included) or the fresh shrimp and cocktail sauce. All in all (bogo - $7.50 a person), if you make wise choices, you can get a great meal.When I saw Tutto Pasta's menu -- a long list of unusual pasta dishes, including some homemade pasta, with quality ingredients and rarer pasta types, cheeses, and sauces -- I was elated and couldn't wait to try it. Unfortunately, my pasta (a spicy daily special with anchovies) was a bit of a greasy salt-fest. I know anchovies are inherently salty, but it didn't seem like the chef made the dish otherwise less salty to compensate. My friend ordered a daily special chicken entree and also felt it was just OK.

The restaurant was gorgeous inside -- and completely empty for a Saturday lunch!! I went with a Groupon specifically for this location, so it appears they are trying to drum up business. I heard it was newer but other reviews seem to indicate it's been open for four years.

They did have a good wine list. If Tutto Pasta could focus on making the food a bit fresher and lighter, I'd gladly come back -- and probably will, just to give them one more try, since they have plenty to choose from besides plain old bolognese.Came here after a movie for a light bite and drinks. We tried Grape right after it opened and weren't impressed, but it's been open a while now and we wanted to give it another shot. Anyway, ordered a couple glasses of wine, the garlic hummus, a chicken quesadilla and a roasted tomato and spinach flatbread. There was a different flatbread we really wanted, but it had a bleu cheese which neither me or the bf like and when we asked the waiter if we could sub a different cheese he said no, because it wouldn't melt right. That seemed a bit strange to me, since there are several other flatbreads on the menu with all different cheeses that manage to melt. When the food came out super fast it made me think everything it pre-made and nuked to order. Everything was pretty mediocre and the wines by the glass all seem pretty spendy to me...you would think a wine bar would have more variety. Our waiter was very on top of things and kept the water glasses full, so I gotta bump up a star for that. The atmosphere is cool so it's disappointing that the food isn't better.My friends and I got wristbands for free entries to ROK. I must say that I love the music that they are playing. I like the layout of the club and you can watch music videos of songs that they are playing on giant screens all over the club. So three stars for that.

Minus two stars for the ridiculous drink prices. I can understand that my Vodka 7 is $11 because this is Vegas and all mixed drinks in Vegas are overpriced. Oh they don't even have 7 up, they serve Sierra Mist..yuckkk. Then my friend just got the Sierra Mist without any alcohol in it and we got charged $6!!!! Yes, $6 for a glass of soda! 

Highway robbery to the max.Over inflated prices, exaggerated brands, ego driven shoppers, and ridiculous out of this world food that you can make at home? The hell do I want to go here for? Really not worth shopping here; really. Went in and could not believe how this place creates suckers out of people. Think your buying organic and helping some company with charity work? Hell no! Just the opposite. Your helping the business men get fatter wallets and helping yourself get more sicker with these fake healthy food. 

  Do some research and find out the truth about this place.  The employees are nice though, the shoppers blow. Typical shopper here are those parents with no mentoring skills to teach there kids properly. Instead of teaching them they hand them an ipad, or iphone in hopes of shutting them up and skipping on raising children. Single people here are just as dumb. If Whole Foods would just come out and say, "Our shit isn't all that healthy and we have been lying." I'd shop here. But kinda a waste if you ask me. Bleh!It was Ok.  Was too hungry to wait at the Bellagio 1 hour buffet line so came over to Aria and had no wait.  They served Lobster which was cold by the time we got it and the food was just ok.  Some hit and misses.  Shrimp/Dessert/some chinese food were delicious.  Other things were just ok or bad like the overcooked fish.

I expected better from a $40 buffet and explains why the place had no wait and plenty of openings during dinner.Food was tasty, and there was a wide range of cuisines on the menu, but my putanesca wasn't anything special.  I was most appreciative of the non-alcoholic beverage selection, and opted for the Nojito.  It was not as good as the mojitos I remember from pre-pregnancy, but at least it wasn't plain water.

Service was fine, though the whole atmosphere was a tad pretentious, imo.The Dome is set in a beautiful restored bank building in downtown Edinburgh, Scotland. Each of several dining rooms has its own opulent character from glitzy brass and crystal chandeliers to dark woods and white table cloths.  Service is formal and professional.  The menu is safe and traditional and the cuisine is good, but not outstanding - not a satisfying experience for those on a "foodie" mission.  Cant recommend a particular "signature dish."

I found downtown, Edinburgh a strangely attractive place, as in "I felt drawn there."  The view of the ancient castle and the gardens below from across the boulevard continues to stick with me.

Do visit the Dome.  It will help set the tone for your tour through Scotland.For any newcomer, arriving in Edinburgh, or even for someone who is not particularly familiar with Edinburgh the first port of call has to be the Tourist Information Centre.  Located just by Waverley Station and on Princes Street, it is ideal for those arriving either by train or by plane.  If you have arrived by the latter means of transport and you have taken the airport shuttle bus into Edinburgh then you will be just down the road from here.  From the stairs onto Princes Street leaving Waverley station, turn left and you shall soon see it slightly set back from the road and heralded by a small paved square.  For those trying to find it from elsewhere, your best chance of success would be to ask directions or follow signs to Waverley station and go from there.

You may wonder why I've been so specific about directions in a review - it is because this is the best place for finding a map.  The first time I arrived in Edinburgh to scout the town out I arrived without any idea of where to go and how to get around and it took me a while to find the Tourist Information Centre, but once I found it everything was alright.  This is because, although this is a great place for getting leaflets and finding out information about attractions, its most important role is as a provider of maps.  I've seen few other maps round town and most places tend to run out, but here you can get a map for free that will guide you on your travels.  This fact alone makes this in my opinion one of the most important places in Edinburgh for visitors.I had a friend visiting from England who came to meet me with shock that there was a bar called The He Brides and was that bar for transexual brides? I was totally confused until he took me here and I explained that The Hebrides were islands off the West Coast of Scotland. Not pronounced He Brides. So obviously we had to go in.

The bar is really small and quite dingy. It is filled with regulars who upon hearing my friends English accent struck up the old Braveheart conversation. It was all in good humour and they were all quite friendly. Drinks were fine and reasonably priced too. Now if I am waiting for a train at Waverley and fancy a drink I will often pop in here. Its one of the most real Edinburgh bars with real Edinburgh people that you will get in the city centre, so worth popping in just to see the difference between a small, local pub and the corporate, chain pubs which now litter Edinburgh.Ah, the Monkey,
that is the one on Drummond Street I am talking about. Always good for an evening drink, has all the standard drinks you could wish for and a nice mix of people is making it easy to enjoy yourself. Good to meet people, too.

It's not a highlight but it's certainly always a good option :)

check out their cinema events in the backroom!This is a review of their happy hour.

The Skinny: turkey sliders delivers one hot bird injection but its still hard to overlook the so-so sauces and toppings  (3.5), service: great for a burger joint (5), value: pretty good for a happy hour - 2 plates of sliders, salad, diet coke, a side of fries and fried zucchini = $22 excluding tip (4).

My hubby and I were eager to come try their happy hour where the appys, salads and sliders are 50% OFF. Our server was great, taking the time to explain the specials, refilling our drinks and making sure we were well taken care of. I'm not sure what his name was except his shirt said "Junior" on it. Shout out for being an awesome server!

We tried their fried zucchini, french fries, salad, a order of turkey and beef sliders. Most of the items were well prepared but my main problem was the mediocre sauce pairings. 

The zucchini were nice and crisp with a good cornmeal type coating. However the slightly spicy sauce was not that great. A nice ranch dressing would have been better.

The salad was a pretty standard balsamic vinegar salad with pretty good ingredients - my only complaint was the slight over mealy tomatoes. 

French fries were okay while they were hot and retained some crispness. However, once they cooled, they became soggy and slightly greasy very quickly. The special fries sauce was bland and not that interesting.

Now on to the sliders: both sliders had a good patty to bun ratio. With regards to toppings, just wished they had grilled/fried onions as an option. 

The turkey sliders had a lovely juiciness to them. (Literally, one big bird injection in the mouth... heh heh heh) However, despite the wonderful texture of the patty, it was definitely underseasoned. The accompanying herb mayo didn't help either - bland upon bland. Not to mention the toppings of cucumber and alfalfa sprouts cannot stand up to a warm patty (the cucumber once warm becomes slimy, the alfalfa becomes wilted).

The beef sliders were okay not great. The patty was not nearly as juicy as the turkey burger but was better seasoned. The "LBS" sauce was a little smokey ketchup - nothing special. Again, the burger could have used a better topping than just a pickle and the aforementioned sauce.

I can't help but compare this place with the newly opened Yardhouse's sliders and happy hour specials. I would say if you took into account the service, the ambience and the wait times, I would definitely favour LBS over Yardhouse for happy hour.This place is solid, but not amazing. The sweet potato fries are very good. The burgers are solid, and the milk shakes are ok. I'm a milkshake lover so I'm sure I'm biased.  But the food is good, the service is solid, and the prices are reasonable. But nothing really glows about the place.  
I'd recommend it for happy hour or something where you get a better deal. But I think when I went to Smashburger down the street, I had just as good a meal for a bit less money.Although Robertsons Bar is one of many many pubs in Edinburgh, it is unique in that it maintains a pretty old-fashioned premise about it.  It looks like something from the 1960s, but not in an old and tatty way, in a cute wee cosy way.

Robertsons sells a good selection of different beers, ales, wines and the usual standard spirits.  The prices are really reasonable here with a spirit and mixer costing about £2.50 and a large glass of house wine costs about five pounds.  There is limited food available, which I was pretty disappointed with as I was here drinking for several hours and was hungry and had to go to another pub to get a meal there.  Robertsons pretty much just sells crisps, peanuts and pies.  

There is a really lovely and fun atmosphere in here and the staff are always friendly, but when it gets busy it can be really difficult to get the attention of the bar staff to get a drink.  A cosy little pub which is great for a drink, but not so great for food.This is a total novelty bar. You will stay about 20 mintues in the freezer drink your two gimmick ice drinks, take a few expensive photos and be ready to leave. The lounge out the freezer that has fire places and drink service is actually way nicer and very relaxing. After everything like jackets, cover charge, and pics your easily looking at $100 per couple.Nice restaurant in Leith, lovely food and if you are lucky enough with the weather, a beaut to have your food on their veranda and watch boy boat racers!Greggs is a company that is much like most "grab and go" companies who are there to put something in your belly and not much else.

So to me, what makes each branch different is their team work ethic and individual personalities and how they blend together.

You never have the time to get to know your team of staff, and as soon as you strike up friendships and rapport with a team, they are moved on to a different store so you then have to restart the process of getting to know your new team. This can be a pain seeing as I work in the area.

If all you are after is extra calories and stodge then, my friend, welcome to Heaven. 3 stars because across the board, Greggs do what they set out to do, keep you full for a low price.I thought the best place to go to stock up on the essentials for the new addition would be a big store. 
Whilst I can't fault the helpfulness/knowledge of the staff & the range/selection of stuff on offer, the essentials are very expensive here. Kitten food is 30% more than the supermarket, that's not even with an offer on in the supermarket & cat litter is also cheaper in most of the big supermarkets.
Good selection of brands & choice but needs to be more competitive on price to keep my custom.To reitterate Jonathan, this place is a mess.

But.....it does exactly what it says on the tin. Thus, you can't really complain too much about it!! It's Pound Savers and it saves you money. Since becoming a student I've got into the habbit of buying small things I may need - cloths, towels, soaps etc - from bargain stores just like this one. I then am surprised when my towels get holes and my soap makes my skin go funny. But it saves me money, so let's not get choosey.

They have everything you would ever need here, it was a heck of a novelty for me when I first came to Edinburgh. But watch out - I found myself buying total crap just because it was cheap. I now have a post-boSometimes River Island is absolutely brilliant. Sometimes, it's total crap.

It has a horrible habbit of using sequins, feathers and shoulder pads in all the ways they shouldn't be used. There is a glitter and sequin extravaganza when you walk in, which often tempts me to turn right back round again. But if you persevere you can often find some quite nice things in here

Avoid the dresses though, they are so skin tight nothing is left to the imagination - and that's the best part!

Their jeans are always really nice, and they have great quality t-shirts and tops. Their handbags too are really good, but in my experience their jewelery isn't so hot.Holy shashlik kebab batman. That was one big plate of food. Seriously, the most noteworthy thing about this restaurant is the portion sizes, and the subsequent (delicious) food baby that ensued.

My friend and I dined here early one Monday evening - restaurant dead hour. As a result it was just us, and one other table. So ambience was lacking. There was also some awful twangy hawaiin inspired Indian music on in the background, and it was loud enough that we kept noticing and commenting. And last little irk, the waiter practically fell over himself insisting we ordered poppadoms. Which we really didn't want. And had to say NO to several times. Luckily he didn't bring them, but seriously - I know you make mark up from selling fried air at 40p a pop, but I don't want them!

Anyway, the better stuff. The food. The menu is more British Indian than traditional. I appreciate good food in its traditional form, and so prefer restaurants that serve up the closest imitation to straight-from-the-country as it can. There are other Indians in Edinburgh that do this better. But for what it was - British Indian - it seemed ok.

We both went for the Chicken Shashlik kebab - chicken tandoori with green peppers, onions and tomato. As we ordered the same thing, when it was brought out we assumed the portion in the waiters hand was for both of us to share. He proceeded to dish it onto my friend's plate...and continued serving it ALL until it was gone, and reappeared with a fresh sizzling platter of meat for me. I regretted ordering the boiled rice as 'filler'.

Actually that's one other wee thing that irked me. I would have preferred if he'd set the sizzler down beside us and we had helped ourselves, rather than putting it *all* on our plates at once, for us. As a result I ate it all, but perhaps wouldn't have done had it been on the sizzler. A tactic?

Anyway, the chicken itself was a wee bit dry, and the yoghurt tandoori marinade a wee bit chalky, but the vegetables were quite nice - I liked the tomato - and as far as meals go it was finished, and enjoyed. Not outlandishsly wonderful by any stretch, but for 'filling Indian fare' it hit the spot.

But the best part was the price. That previously mentioned mountain of sizzling meat set me back £8. The rice and pickles added on bumped it up a wee bit, but I didn't touch my rice. Value for money it is!

I think I'd rather order takeaway from here than eat in again. We were eating in as we were popping into the Dominion for a film after, and neither of us expected more than we got for 6pm on a Monday. But I think for those nights you need a huge amount of spicy food in front of The Apprentice or Friday night film, this could hit the spot. Just make sure and say NO poppadoms if you're that way inclined.Canny Man's has some wierd paranoia about anybody coming in who is potentially threatening, dirty or has a knack for taking photos.  Most places will let just about anybody in and then ask those unwelcome to leave, but Canny Man's is, apparantly, not most places.  I was kind of bewildered as to what their disconcerting sign was all about, as it's not particularly posh inside.  
In fact, I thought it was kind of boring.  It's just a standard pub with nice decor, reasonably priced drinks, unfriendly staff and no TV screens.  This is certainly not the place to come and get rowdy over a heavy session, but if you're after a chilled out drink in the afternoon or evening, this could be the place.It's all just a bit lost on me, its art that doesn't know what to do with itself.

If your going to do anything artistic on the commercial market, it has to be functional. All the stuff looks impressive as hell but lets be honest, you're not going to cook in an apron that costs more than £3 are you?

It's the kind of place that you go to buy a unique gift that the person will never use. But it will make them look that little bit more trendy as it gathers dust in the corner.The day was cloudy, with great fleets of grey scudding across the sky reminding me of my time on the south coast. The scent of salt was in the air and there was the familiar sounds of the train station in the background. 

I sniffed once with my eyes closed - absorbing the vibrant atmosphere. The Conductors whistles blasted thrice bringing back memories of childhood, my grandpa and the smell of travel. 

Moving through the crowds I noticed an old man standing quietly by the wall. His hands were clasped over an old wooden cane, the wrinkles around his eyes hinting at a thousand stories. Our eyes met, we both knew that we were on the same level. That we both were taking it all in. We were both being transported back to memories, love, pain, fear, and hope for the future. 

I bought a sandwich. It was alright I guess.Very hit-and-miss.

Sometimes, you go in here and find the most perfectly fitting bras that a) look good, and b) are well-priced. Sometimes though, you look on every single rack and still don't find anything that even your Vicky Pollard would wear. Last time I was in here, the 'in' coulours were the most ridiculous things I've ever seen in my life... who needs underwear in acid neon shades of yellow/green/pink/orange?! Not exactly attractive.

Whinge over, they measuring service here is really good. And what's more, because their sizes are really small, in La Senza you'll always need a bra one size bigger than in most others places. Bonus!

It's probably worth trying in here next time you're out shopping for underwear, especially if they have a sale on. Just don't hold your breath.I first came into scayles when a friend was planning on buying a guitar.  There was a lot to choose from (the store seems to specialise in this department) and the staff was eager to assist and advise.


They have a good selection of instruments. All are fairly competiively priced. The shop isn't the biggest but they make the most of the space.Great place for drinks...I didn't try any of the food, but the drinks were delish. Moscow mules are yummy. I would recommend this place for a nightcap. The space is interesting so visit this place just to see the randomness like the old elevator shaft, the mirrored hallway to the bathroom, and the hidden DJ booth!Good use of an old space. I was informed by our server that this was a department store from the 1940"s until the mid 1980's, and then used for the next 20 years as a training facility for the Phoenix Fire Department. After that, it became Hanny's.

We started with a Gray Goose Cosmo and a Stella. Both were on point.

We shared a snack plate. Good stuff.

If you expect a New York style Margherita pizza, don't hold you breath. We got an oblong shaped thin crust pie that struck me as a standard pie (aside from the shape) that you could get in any New York pizzeria. Good, as in edible, but not great.

Finished of with a Tiramisu. Now this was good stuff......I have to say that I was quite disappointed after reading such stellar reviews on the site first.  If this is the best Sushi in Madison, then Madison is sorely lacking in good Sushi.  I've had much better in several cities across the country.

MISO SOUP - OK, but nothing special, and what's with the cheap metal western spoon?  When I order Miso soup in a Sushi restaurant, I want an Asian spoon to go with it.

POKE- very good!  This one thing alone kept me from dropping this restaurant down to two stars.  If you go here get the Poke (big eye tuna, sesame seaweed, yuzu-miso).

DUCK ROLL - uneventful.  Nothing wrong with it, but nothing that would make me order it again.

VIPER ROLL  - this one was good.  Not spectacular, but the best one of the three that were ordered tonight.

SOFT SHELL CRAB - not good at all.,  The crab tasted like it was a bit old - not fresh.

GENERAL SUSHI COMMENT - they need to wrap the sushi tighter.  The rolls fall apart way too easily while you're trying to pick them up.  There also just seems to be a general bland flavor to their sushi rolls -nothing exciting whatsoever.

SERVICE: no issues with service except that we did have to ask for drink refills instead of them being automatic.  No big deal here because they were easy to flag down, but you shouldn't have to flag them down at all.

OVERALL, I am not inclined to return as I know where to get much better sushi in other cities that I frequent.  If this is the best that Madison has, then, well, I'm sorry.I was not overly impressed with this restaurant.  I have read previous reviews and am surprised at the level of service expressed in them because I definitely did not feel like the service was exceptional...average, but not exceptional.  I thought we had what seemed to be a little of everything...only the Crispy Tempura Roll stands out as being really good!  All the rest was good but...

I have to give it the benefit of the doubt; this was my first sushi visit in Scottsdale.  Maybe I will need to revisit this once I've visited others.I went here with my parents for a quick dinner on a Monday night. It seems to be a busy location and there were a number of people waiting at the  front for tables, but nevertheless they found us a table in no time, which was nice. 

We informed our waiter that we were in a bit of a hurry. I ordered the French Onion Soup. It should have been called Italian Onion Soup as the menu listed provolone as the cheese on top, but nevertheless is was delicious. I'm a big fan of F.O.S. Theirs wasn't exceptional, but fit the  bill with lots of gooey cheese and flavourful broth. 

Our steaks took a bit longer than we expected to come out. Our waiter had warned us against ordering medium rare, which is how I usually order. He gave us the spiel "Rare is warm red throughout, medium rare is pink with a warm red center, etc." I always thought med. rare was pink throughout, like a nice bright pink, with rare being more rubbery and almost raw. I had opted for the ribeye, medium rare despite his warning it might be too rare, while my parents each had a small sirloin. We all ordered mashed potatoes and veggies. 

The steaks came. Theirs were pretty decent, generally pink-looking, even though my mother ordered hers medium. Mine, well, it was well-done. Grey with a tinge of pink. Barely. Nicely seasoned, well-marbled flavourful ribeye, but totally overdone from what I specified. Like a previous reviewer, I was in a hurry, and hungry, and ate the whole steak anyway. However, we did at first say something to the waiter about the long wait, and the manager came with two 4$ lunch coupons, which was nice. Then our waiter came back a bit later and asked about the steaks and I showed him mine. He agreed that it was overdone. To his immense credit, he got the manager to return, who then comped the (rather expensive) rib-eye steak and apologized profusely. From other reviewers' experiences, I'm wondering if they might have problems with the cooking staff getting orders right. 

I find that unless I'm at a serious fine dining establishment, it's pretty hard to get a rare or medium rare steak. I've had staff say, "That's how we do medium rare," when they bring out a well-done steak, and leave it at that. So to the credit of The Outback Steakhouse, they at least acknowledged their mistake. I give them three stars because generally I think the food is pretty good, and I know  my folks really like it here and have had many meals they enjoyed. At present, I wouldn't recommend them as a place to get a steak prepared exactly to your specifications. And thanks to our sever for being such a good sport.I was looking for a hamburger and fries type of place and tried Tommy's.  I had a burger and fries without the chili.  They are definetely a step above McDonalds,  and they were good and I could have had them with many different toppings and was asked by friendly wait staff if I wanted more on my order.  The place was clean and the customers seemed to be regulars as most said they would return as they were leaving and acknowledged by the staff.  My next visit, I'll try the Chili on my order and update my review.I came here yesterday evening at about 5:30 and were the first and only in the restaurant.  I waited at least 5 minutes to be acknowledged and seated, as the host was no where to be found.  Not a great first impression for a first time customer.  

We were seated and were promptly brought out water and menus.  Since I always get the green curry, Thai hot, and my daughter always orders the chicken skewers, we put out order in before other people had even ordered.  I requested that both dishes come out at the same time since she was eating an appetizer as an entrée.  Her order was brought out 15 minutes later, and mine came out a good 10 minutes after that.   Let me say that I was less than happy, since other tables that ordered well after I did were already being served.  

The curry was good, but was not the best that I've had.  Lacking eggplant if you ask me, but the amount of vegetables was great.  They did Thai spice very well too, as it cleared my sinuses in no time flat.  The portions are very large, definitely enough to share or bring home for another large meal the next day.  The chicken skewers were decent, cold by the time my dish came out though, so my (very picky) daughter hardly touched them after that.

As for the staff, let's just say their personalities were literally the most bland I've ever experienced.  Christ almighty, couldn't get a smile out of any of them...and I'm quite pleasant and fun!  They all seemed like they hated their job, hated life, and at any moment one of them would pull a 12 gauge from the back and start picking off staff and customers before ending it all!  

Not sure if I would come back here...the restaurant is beautiful, the food is pretty good, but aside from the great ambiance, it was lacking, to say the least.  Plus, they play terrible indie electronica music, which, between you and I, makes me think I should be in a gay bar, rather than an upscale Thai restaurant.

Eat here or don't, but you can get better service, food, in almost as pretty of a restaurant that plays authentic Thai music over @ Siam Thai (50th and northern).Doug was our server and was fantastic!  Other than that...drinks were ok, tacos were small, yet tasty. We tried the short ribs, the bbq pork, steak, carnitas and shrimp tacos. The rice was awesome while the beans were mediocre....black and pinto. Happy hour was kinda lame. I wouldn't choose this place but wouldn't be opposed to going back.Been to this location several times. Food is always real good but the service is horrible here.The menu is pretty amazing, lot's of stuff I want to come back and try! Seems like they have a lot of drink specials too!

Had the Naked French Toast, the side of acorn squash was a bit odd, would love to see some regular hash browns on the menu. The pricing is pretty decent and the staff are pretty nice (a bit slow) but nice. Definitely a place to just come and hang.First time...food was great...can't wait to go to a moes that's not at the airport!Breakfast at the bar really works. Service can be a bit slow but the quality is very good. Would rate it higher if they left the coffee pot at your table. Gotta keep an eye out for the server to get a refill. They have an ample breakfast buffet plus a menu with many options. Price point is reasonable. This GLC has a more attractive atmosphere than the one in the Venetian.We went for an anniversary dinner. The atmosphere was great. The view was great.  The service was very helpful. 

We enjoyed the oysters, tuna tartar, salad, filet mignon, broccoli and French fries.  Other than the steak being more medium than medium rare, everything was delicious. 

We ordered the apple cobbler for dessert and they brought us a chocolate lava cake too as a surprise for our anniversary. The cake was good, but really--do we need two desserts?  They should have just comped the cobbler. 

All in all really good--overpriced but good.Today I took my daughter into justice at 745 pm to buy a skirt. The first thing out of the sale girls mouth was we close in 5 minutes.  Not like can I help you.    Boo for their serviceThis place was pretty cool. I got passes so I didn't have to pay, which was cool. The ambiance is pretty nice and I like the music they play.  The drinks weren't too expensive. I guess I've seen more expensive drinks at other nightclubs.I think we would have enjoyed it more had we been told about the sunday night swim thing. We were told to "dress to impress" and our promoter even texted to ask where we were. Come on, we're on our way!

It was my first time at Encore and the decor was beautiful. My girlfriend and I had to walk down this long hallway after checking in with one of the guys. It was a bit like silence of the lambs with rowdy drunk guys on the other side of the rope. Not all the guys were cat calling, of course but it was enough to make us feel uncomfortable. Once we got to the end, we had to basically walk up a narrow path flushed against the wall with those same guys on the other side. I think they just wanted some girls to get them in. 

XS was beautiful with multiple pools and great landscaping. Maybe it was still too early but it wasn't too crowded with people scattered about. So why were all those guys waiting outside for?

People weren't dancing but instead, they were sitting around or talking on their phones. A few were in the process of getting into the pool but it felt like prom with people waiting for the party to get started. 

We did a round, took some pictures and left for Bank. XS was too much of a multiple personality disorder for me to deal with that night. We were looking for straight dancing.Their vegetarian dishes are plentiful, and you get a good amount with them (I ordered something akin to chow mein with stir-fried vegetables, and I couldn't finish half of it because they gave me so much!)

Their menu has some interesting items as far as combination and stir-fry plates go. As for the sushi (sashimi and traditional sushi pieces), I have to admit they are a little pricey, and there is cheaper sushi to be found elsewhere. They do feature special plates with combinations of different sushi pieces, but like I said, there are definitely better deals elsewhere in town than here. 

Overall, the plate that I had was delicious. I went after work during the later hours of the night, and since the place was nearly vacant, I didn't have a problem with getting my food quickly. The service was nice and friendly, and do expect a little of the "shogun" attitude here and there. I will definitely have to return to try other things!Dazbog Coffee is locate inside The Great Indoor and serves really good coffee. As I've said in my other review, I come here a few times a week and always enjoy the folks behind the counter and the pastries. They also have a flat screen tuned usually to the Food Network or the Golf Channel.Went here last night, tried broccoli beef.very surprised lots of beef and great flavor.wife had fettucini, she said that was horrible.will return to try other Chinese dishes.son has Mongolian beef and that was good.It was just ok. The service was very good, but the Chinese we ordered wasn't. We ordered the orange and general chicken with fried rice. The chicken was over done and the rice was very dry. Don't think we'll be back.Good food, exceptional service.

Great atmosphere and decor; the silver dragon sculpture on the wall is splendid. I would say it's a semi-luxury restaurant because it's connected to the casino and doesn't have the privacy of a real high-end restaurant. Still, the decor and food is nothing to look down upon. The pad thai tasted very clean and simple without too much spice to distract the taste. The Wazuzu roll was also good. My only disappointment with Wazuzu was my expectation for the food was very high. You can find a similar pad thai dish around town and you can buy an AYCE for the price of one Wazuzu roll, which was good but not exceptional. The food is a safe bet.I liked the decor in here, and the staff were fast, but the prices and crowds do let it down a bit. Admittedly a crowd is usually a sign of something desirable, so I won't use this against the place. It was just kind of annoying as my friends and I couldn't hear ourselves speak, and we didn't think we were going to a club. We also waited for ages to be served, and it wasn't even the weekend!

The expertise in cocktail making really are this place shines. That and the high ceilings and elegant design. 

Dragonfly does lose a point for the prices... However good the cocktails are, I can't justify paying £7 for a martini.... Nor £4 for the cheapest pint on menu. At the end of the day, this is still just a place where people get hammered, and I didn't see much in the way of moderate drinking for the pleasure of it here. 

I would return if I saw fewer crowds and lower prices...Meh. I think the food is mediocre, but my wife likes it. Definitely better places around SanTan.  The service isn't the best either. It's also a little pricey for what you get. Just my opinion.The Irish are a bit like the Scots, except unlike the Scots who tend to wallow in their status as Europe's lowlifes, they do quite a good job of tricking foreigners into thinking they're nice, genuine, fun-loving people.

They're not of course, and deep down they're just as hostile and embittered as the rest of us, but you wouldn't think it from the constant fiddle music, pints of guinness, and undercurrent of religious hatred that combines to give Biddy's it's unique atmosphere.

Avoid at weekends or on St Patrick's day, it's a living hell.If you don't have a car to leave the strip for Chinese food, then I guess this is the place to go to.  Located in Caesar's Palace, my wife and I checked out the menu and decided to give it a try.

The decor is great and modern.  But we waited awhile for the food we ordered.  We only ordered 2 dishes.  We ordered salt and pepper chicken and beef chow fun.  Both dishes were great.  

This place is expensive though.  And the service was just ok.  So if you have a lot of money to spare for food you can get for half the price off the strip, eat here.I am impressed by the improvements that the Tropicana has gone through in it's makeover session. I stayed here for two nights, as this was the host hotel for a race my roommate and I were running and we were both thrilled with the experience. The staff was extrememly friendly and easy to work with-we were even able to get a phone call for an early check-in on Friday.

This was a great price for being on the strip and being in walking distance or a cab ride from anywhere else you want to go.

BTW-Don't forget to tip your house keepers for the hard work that they do.It was around 4 pm when I walked in for a to-go order. I ordered the hummus with grilled chicken under the appetizer section. I didn't have to wait long for my order to arrive, probably 5-10 minutes at the most.

The decor was very airy it was very well lit.

I agree with fellow yelpers that their hummus was smooth and flavorful. Actually, it is probably the best hummus I've had in a while.  

There was a sliver of cucumber, a small wedge of tomato and one olive on top of the hummus. Then there was a fairly generous portion of grilled chicken and pine nuts sprinkled on top as well.

However, I was extremely disappointed with the chopped grilled marinated chicken. The chicken pieces were definitely over cooked and dried. If I was eating at the restaurant, I would've definitely made a comment to the wait staff. The chicken also had a tangy marinate to it which was too tangy for my liking. It felt like there was an extra squeeze of lemon juice that I thought they could do without. This was a bummer since their hummus is indeed very good and if it was cooked properly with juicy pieces of chicken then this place would have gotten a 4 stars at least.

The two pitas that they give you are a lot larger than the normal pita breads you get at the store so there is plenty to share.

If I'm in the area again craving Mediterranean food, I'll probably give this place a try again and order something that doesn't have their grilled chicken.This is the kind of place I'd want to stumble across if I were visiting this city. It feels like a local gem, with great atmosphere and a casual but warm-seeming crowd. The service was okay, The service is attentive and very personable.

That said, those qualities are enough for me to overlook some not-as-stellar things. I didn't like the flavor combination of the tomato soup. There weren't any real overarching element to bring the ingredients together.

I also tried the CRABbread pizza, and though the crust was amazing, the crab meat (and whatever other ingredients were on that pizza) were lost among a mass of very oily onions.

The wine is very reasonably priced here....you can get bottles for $15.

So if Taps, you can dial back the oil, and let your super fresh ingredients shine through more on their own, this would definitely be five stars in my book.We've stopped in on our way out of town a couple of times.  The food is pretty crappy, but I'll take it over McDonald's any day!  You have personal juke boxes in your booth, which is pretty cute but we've never gotten it to work correctly :(    It's diner food; the meatloaf sandwich was pretty good, and the burgers not bad.  The fries were not very good but the milkshake was wonderful!  If you're in the area stop in.The prototypical neighborhood pizza joint that wins your patronage more on convenience and the fact that you know the owners.Being born and bred from the midwest it was comforting to have a coffee shop like Kady's in our hotel. However since we are from Chicago the absolute mecca of restaurants, Kady's did fall a bit short. Don't get me wrong the food was average, but the service was slow. The breakfast was alot more appealing then lunch. I wouldn't go out of my way but if you are hungry and its late...stop by Kady's.

Keep in mind the host tends to disapppear, so you will be standing around until someone notices you.Lunching with my OG Ryan B, we were on the search for something different. I have been to other Ohana locations, but had never tried this location on Eastern. 

I was craving kalbi, so we decided to give this place a try. They have a very extensive menu and plenty of great lunch specials. You can get pretty much every plate in mini / lunch or full size. I came in knowing I wanted kalbi, but I was almost swayed by all the other great options. I eventually went with my initial craving and got the kalbi. 

The food was ready quickly and we grubbed and chatted while we ate. The atmosphere is really nice. Clean and comfortable. I wasn't too in love with the kalbi, wishing it was a little more flavorful, but overall it was still a tasty meal. Not the best I've ever had, but I'll probably be back to try some of their other lunch menu options.The location was really clean, interior is really cute (decorative) and the self-service option is great. The sample cups are huge. You can easily get full after sampling a couple of flavors.

Overall, I would still have to say Pinkberry is the best froyo. And Mojo really falls short of the good quality tart-ness required of an original flavor.

There are always groupon now! deals that are worth buying to get a better deal.New casino, nice decor, fresh smell, and located on the strip.  Always nice to see something new or different when going to vegas. They have brown carpet for their crap tables and they have like 12 crap tables!!!I stayed at ARIA on a recent spontaneous one-night trip to Vegas.  As an LA resident, the one-night Vegas trips have started to become somewhat of a all night party/gamble/clubbing binge, and we usually decide to stay in the cheapest hotel possible.

However, since we booked the hotel at 2:30 am the previous morning (figure it out), we decided to splurge a bit, and headed for ARIA.  Although this was for sure the nicest place I've stayed in Vegas, it doesn't compare to luxury hotels elsewhere.

The location is great, and the new shuttle comes though, so it's easy to get to Monte Carlo & Bellagio. 

The front desk was pleasant, although the guy kept calling me Mrs. Decker, when there was no evidence of me being married.  Although I did stay with a male (who was subsequently called Mr. Decker, lol), we had a two queen room, and I don't wear any rings etc.  It was just a little awkward, and I tried not to lught.  

The view from our 21st floor room was of the Vdara and Cosmopolitan pools.  For a "backside" of the hotel view, it was pretty decent.  The rooms were big, the beds were fluffy and EVERYTHING was automated by a little touch screen remote.  The beds, the music, TV, curtains etc.  I was pretty excited about that, although there was a bit of a delay in the touch screen, which made me accidentally turn everything on/off/on/off a few times due to the delay.

The bathrooms were large, but the shower pressure was weak, the towels were stiff, and they provided 1-ply toilet paper.  I'm sorry, but if you're going to charge $200+ a night for a hotel, I don't think it's too much to ask for the good TP!

We ate at the buffet ($37 on a Saturday), and I suppose it was decent.  There was a TON of seafood including crab legs and lobster.  I'm allergic to shellfish, so this didn't thrill me.  There was still a wide selection of other foods, but the focus was definitely on sea food.  They also provided unlimited house wine, which tasted cheap, but it was free, and I like cheap wine anyway.

I didn't spend much time in this casino, as we hightailed it to Bellagio shortly after our dinner.

I didn't use the spa services, but I purused

There wasn't anything that made this hotel absolutely outstanding, and for the price I would say it was average.  If it was more moderately priced, I would have added a 4th star.In all of its sleek and sophisticated grandeur, the Aria represents a new Las Vegas; a crown jewel in the road to upscale norm and price markups paved by the empire of CIty Center not previously seen since the other luxury properties were erected. To suggest that the MGM folks might've outdone themselves with this one may be an understatement depending on who you're asking, but one cannot ignore the lush and contemporary flavor that the Aria brings to the city.

The only property within the CityCenter umbrella with a casino is Aria. The floor is not as impressive as other nearby resorts, but is certainly no slouch with a decent array of machine and table games. Some folks may enjoy the sports book with its abundant sea of TVs and spacious seating area. Kudos to the casino marketing folks for keeping the promotions constant and a nod goes to the stellar staff of dealers and cocktail wait staff for keeping things classy.

I haven't had a chance to stay in the Aria admittedly, but I am fairly familiar with their rooms, all of which are comfy, stylish, and gorgeous. The regular rooms should fare just fine for most patrons, try to score midweek room rates if you can since they're crazy pricey on the weekends (the high suites are no joke anytime during the week). Also located within the casino is a massive 3 story convention center, a major treat for those of us coming to Sin City on business. That itself is an amazing spot of the resort.

If there is an attraction that makes the Aria worth checking out, it's the pool area. Not the Cirque du Soleil show (Elvis?) or sigh worthy nightlife, the pool deck is massive, containing a series of mini pools as well as one public pool. Unlike its CC cousin Vdara, there shouldn't be any building caused sunburns. (See here: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-1316444/Las-Vegas-death-ray-hotel-leaves-guests-badly-burnt.html) 

On a food front, the Aria has a wide selection of distinctive eateries. The obligatory casino buffet (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-buffet-at-aria-las-vegas-2#query:Aria%20Restaurants dubbed "The Buffet at Aria") is predictably boring and pricey, while the Aria Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/aria-caf%C3%A9-las-vegas) is downright no bueno. For being one of the only dedicated Thai restaurants on the strip, Lemongrass (http://www.yelp.com/biz/lemongrass-las-vegas) isn't terrible but barMASA (http://www.yelp.com/biz/barmasa-las-vegas) is. If there were only two establishments worth mentioning, let it be the tapas friendly Julian Serrano (http://www.yelp.com/biz/julian-serrano-las-vegas) and Sage (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sage-las-vegas-2), which is not only best restaurant but easily one of the finest on the Strip.

Like any good casino property, Aria does a solid job of keeping itself afloat with what it has. Whether or not it was worth the billion + to put together is debatable, but if the City Center is a must visit on your Vegas check list, then the Aria should be the first and last stop.I stayed here with my gf for 3 nights room 17008. 09-05 thru the 8. I would love to stay here again. But even tho I had my service light on every time we're not in the room between 10AM-4 it hasn't never been any cleaning since we've stayed there. Either that that. Everything was super great. 

Try the aria cafe. Nachos is gonna hit the spot.

Don't wait in line to checkout. You can do that on the programs on the tv.

Gym- make sure you wear shoes cause people got kicked out for wearing slippers.

The buffet- AVOID IT!!!! Not worth it even tho you have a $60 credit from aria. Got me spending $18 that isn't worth it.I recently stayed here for my b-day and a mini family get-a-way. Over all my experience was so-so? When staying at hotels like Vdara I expect to have a wonderful experience.  When In fact it was quite the opposite. When booking our stay we were offered a $50 room credit, but when checking out they were not going to apply it, until we reminded them. Also, when booking they asked the nature of our stay. I told them it was for my bday, and I was taking my family there who where coming from Michigan. They did not acknowledge my b-day  during our stay (disappointment). We decided to stay at Vdara because the rooms where built to be like apartments. They have a kitchen in them, which is great when you are coming with your family. You can make and prepare food in your room. But upon our arrival we discovered they did not offer any kind of kitchen utensiles, pots, pans, etc... Which just seems ridiculous! Why would you have a kitchen with out providing these items? No one travels with cooking equipment! Not even a coffee machine in the room, or a tea selection! Which is standard in any room I have stayed in. And I travel frequently..world wide! Ohh, yeah and they double charged us for our stay. Now dealing with the credit card companies and hotel. That is extra annoying! 

On a positive note, the hotel was clean. Amazing beds and bedding!The fried alligator was surprisingly delicious. I came here on a private function for a work gathering, and upstairs they have a bar, dance floor, and a band that my friend's company provided. A nice atmosphere, though I didn't get to explore the menu more than I should have. Mainly composed of southern cooking. Otherwise, this place is generally dead when it comes to the social atmosphere. Hopefully my next review will be a little more in-depth, since I do plan to come back and return to this place to explore a little more!It's really more like 3.5 stars.  Better than 'OK' but not like I'm a total Fan... I mean... it's a really good breakfast but they don't serve bloody marys... so.... ya know.

Service:
Got there a little before 8am... there were a few people in line but we were seated quickly... and the busser got us our coffees and waters really quick... and then we waited for like 15 minutes.  Our waitress was slammed and she was 1 of only 2 working at the moment.
She was really nice and efficient.
Our food was delivered quickly... and hot.

Food:
Taste.... right on!  I ordered the Veggie Benny... and it came with lots of avocado slices which I love!  The side of potatoes were 'ok'...nothing special... they need seasoning or something but I don't really need the extra starch... so I left them.

The hubby had the croissant breakfast sandwich and that looked good... I didn't get a taste because I was too excited about the yummy avocados on my dish.

The FIL got the oatmeal overload.... WOW!  It came with fresh berries, cream, raisins, brown sugar and almond slivers on the side... and a huge bowl of oatmeal.  Looked Great and he was happy with it so thumbs up.

Will I be back?  For Sure.  :)great fast Greek food, looking for a lunch place in Mesa, then look no further, this is your place.  The food is good and the salads are really fresh and delish, total bummer that we can't take to-go cups of tea, but them's the rules.Was recommended to this practice from a friend. Wait time in lobby was 30 minutes and I was the only one there, my only complaint. NP Shanna is great and very thorough. They have in office lab and can get you samples of medications which saves you time and money!Blah. For the price, I was disappointed in the food. Pizza was bland and they burgers were overcooked. Fries not seasoned too well but the had great desserts. 

The best thing about this place is definitely the patio. Awesome fire-pit area, tons of T.V.'s for game-day fun. Good for game-days...not so much for just grabbing a bite. Peanut shells on the floor was endearing.

Staff is hit and miss...the first few times we got some cool waitresses but there are a couple who were snobby and seemed to be bothered when we asked for something. Bartenders had a bit of an attitude. 

All-in-all...it's ok.I just wanted to test drive a Smart Car. I was walking around for like ten minutes and nobody helped me. If you want service, you have to go into the Mercedes dealership attached to the Smart Car dealership. Once I did get served though, they were really nice.The food was okay but I was noticing a lot of dirty plates.  I had to search through the pile to find a clean one.  The service was very nice and attentive.Came here for one reason: the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. It did not disappoint. However, the restaurant just doesn't have the same charm as its NYC sibling. Fortunately, they have an outside to-go window. I'll probably just do that next time.What's the hype? Place seems like it's geared to fulfilling women and hyper active children's cravings. Because of all the pink, I thought Victoria Secret or Miss Piggy of the Muppet Babies had a hand in establishing the joint.

The place was busy and there was a wait list that lasted anywhere from 10-25 minutes. We just took refuge at the bar which worked out anyways because we just wanted to try one thing on the menu.

We only stopped by to try that infamous frozen hot chocolate drink ($10). It's big enough to feed two people. After a few sips, I felt my blood sugar maxing out. Soon after I would have the jitters like crack head Tyrone on the Chappelle Show. "Red Balls!" It was okay, but I had much better sweets elsewhere.

Just another place to say that I have sampled something from them. A tad bit overrated but I can totally see Serendipity being blasted on Food Network type shows and getting a lot of attention and hype.A bit delayed on my reviews but finally getting around to it as I went to Vegas two months ago. BUT I still remember the taste of the Famous Frozen Hot Chocolate so don't think my review wont count because as a food junkie, I keep notes on my iPhone and I remember ^.^

So like some of my friends reviews would say, it IS a bit hyped up AND pricey for a Chocolate shake. However, I think its not too terrible. To me, a milkshake is thick, rich and creamy. However, this didn't have the texture of a traditional milkshake so its not quite the same. I had the Peanut Butter Frozen Hot Chocolate. I thought it was really good but was it worth the 13 bucks? Maybe its more worth 8 bucks in my opinion.

I would definitely recommend my friends to check it out but I wouldn't hype it up for them because when something is hyped, we create this huge expectation that it should be fabulous. Overall I give Serendipity 3 a solid 3 stars. We waited a good 45 minutes to be seated and for 3 of my friends to share a small chip appetizer and having a shake to ourselves each, we spent about $22 each including the gratuity and for the wait and price, I didn't think it was quite worth it...but worth it in a sense to try something new and different and "hyped" about, one should check it out.I remember watching the movie serendipity and thought I have to try that dessert. Well I finally made it and I was disappointed. I ordered the frozen hot chocolate, mint flavor for two. It cost $11 for single but $15 for two. So we shared it. The whip cream on there was nothing special. Flavor wise was just okay. I have to admit they blended the ice very fine so I am giving it 3 stars. This is strictly a review about their frozen hot chocolate; we didn't order anything else since we ate brunch at Jean Philippe before heading here.
The decorate of the place is cute. They had some crazy pictures on the wall. You have to wait if you want outside seating. We sat inside and thought it was cozy. 
I saw people ordering food and the salad looked huge. We might go back to try the food, but not for their famous frozen hot chocolate.Uh what can I say about Serendipity 3? Well the workers are friendly. The dessert? Well, nothing to write home about. It is located right in front of the Caesars Palace. Park at their garage, or valet park the car. No parking in front of establishment.Not bad, everything I wanted order there were out of. Had to order other things. After I did in the pick up line for 10 min. Need signs!! Bathrooms need a good scrubbing. I do like the outside atmosphere. Hot dog was ok, fries cold. But impressed, 3 stars because of they have stoneBought a few Groupons awhile back and recently redeemed them before it expired.  The restaurant is located above the Yard House and next to Blue Martini in Town Square, or next to the Rave Motion Picture Theater.

Price is not bad overall, especially if you consider their $5 appetizers, which is like HH pricing and you can order a lot of different food for a casual get together or while watching whatever game is on (you can request the game you want on the TV).

Service is friendly. Orders does however take awhile to be delivered from the kitchen, at least the 2 times I was there when the restaurant wasn't even busy or at 25% capacity (Sunday at around noon and a Thursday afternoon around 5pm).

Spinach, Artichoke and Jumbo Lump Crab Dip served with Crispy Flatbread was good. At $12.95 it is one of their most expensive appetizers, but you get good portions and the flatbread can get addicting.

The only $5 appetizer I tried and liked was the Avocado Eggroll.  You get 1.5 fried eggrolls filled with creamy avocado, which I think is pricey for what it is, but it is yummy.

The Philly Cheesesteak sandwich is just alright. What you get for $10.95 is huge portion, which can easily feed two people with a normal appetite. Their French Fries is good and you get a lot with the sandwich.

Sirloin Steak and Shrimps - steak was nicely marked, but didn't have much flavor and the Demi Sauce that came with it was quickly used up.  The Tiger Shrimps with the scampi sauce was alright too.  I didn't want the Baked Potatoes side, so my waitress switched it with another side (broccoli).

The dessert I tried was Chocolate Lovin' Spoon Cake.  You get a generous slice of cake, which is moist, but I also don't think they make this in house.

Overall, I think it is a cool place to hang out and grab some food (nothing fancy or super delicious) while catching a game or taking a break from shopping.  I am sure it is a cool place to go to at night for an alternative clubbing experience, but I can't comment on that for lack of personal experience.  I do know that the restaurant is available for private functions, as they held a kid's birthday party in the patio seating area on my first visit, and blocked off 1/4 of the restaurant for a private get together on my second visit.

Decor: 3/5  - can get pretty dark in there, but I like their oversize posters, and there are a lot of TVs with ESPN or some game on pretty much at all times.

Food: 2/5 - Not going to win any James Beard awards, but most people come here for the drink specials and grab food as an afterthought.

Price: 3/5

Service: 4/5 - Friendly.

Location: 4/5 - in the hip locals hangout/shopping/entertainment/dining spot off-Strip.

* Mechanical Bull - has potential and just needs the right combination of a good operator and a hottie with a good kung-fu grip for the ride.Just OK,

 I live really close and have been there twice since they opened and let me tell you I love hamburgers. Let me say again, I have been there only twice. 

The tried the Grass feed beef and one time I tried the Kobe.Had a side salad which I did not enjoy at all but the burger was alright. I wasn't excited about the Kobe. I have been to Japan and had Kobe beef. I don't think it should be made into burgers. I wasn't all that excited either about the list you get to assemble your burger. It was like a pre-flight check sheet for a 747.

Like I said it was OK, not knock your socks off.nice location , good service but a little slow. been here twice so far and both times the food i would give 4 stars but both times they screwed up our orders and burger was cold, they did take off 20 percent for the issue and that was nice.. overall i enjoy the food and would go back.Rare 120 is located inside the Hard Rock Casino, it is a steakhouse and they unfortunately do not serve prime rib.  I know, because after a really cursory search of prime rib on Yelp + recommendations of places to check out for prime rib near the Strip, coupled with a very short time allotted for Yelp research, I ended up at Rare 120 and lost some cool points when we discovered they only serve steaks and seafood.

So we unfortunately have to leave after enjoying the nice décor in an almost completely emptied dining area (it was only about 530ish on a Saturday night), view of their impressively looking wine selection, and reading about the wonderfully tasty description of the surf and turf entrees, appetizers and desserts they offer.

The waitstaff was very professional, when they learned that we were actually looking to have prime rib for dinner, and recommended to check out the cafe at Hard Rock as an option.

The hostesses at the front were also super attractive - can't hurt to have supermodels to help attract potential diners to the restaurant.

Next time, I will try their Kobe Beef Carpaccio - truffle, parmesean, arugula, and maybe the Berkshire Organic Pork Porterhouse.Reach 11 has about 18 miles of trails. I'm reviewing the area entering from the east side of Tatum.
The first portion of the trail is paved then branches out to different well-marked connector trails of wide, hard packed dirt. It's a flat and easy hike with a lot of desert vegetation. You can feel like you are away from it all even though it's close to an urban area. We went on a Sunday in January and saw lots of families with children and lots with dogs. It was disheartening to see so much dog poop lining the sides of the trails. I get it, dogs have to go, but how difficult is it to pick it up? It's a groomed city park, not a wilderness area. We have a dog and always carry extra plastic bags in the car. Maybe if the city added a bag dispenser here as they do at other trail heads it might help.This is a pretty good location. The selection is great, and I rarely come here and they don't have what I need. 

The only issues I have with this location are because it is HUGE! This means that it is tough to find things sometimes because everything is so spread out. If you don't mind a scavenger hunt, though, it's a solid location.Cartwright's is American Cuisine fused with Southwest ingredients. You have to give them credit for preparing everything in-house daily that means sauces,  breads and desserts. They proudly let you know they only use all natural steaks and mesquite grill them. They even employee a rising star pastry chef that prepares the desserts for Cartwright's and the sister restaurant Tonto.

They started us off with a nice fresh baked bread sampler and some really ice cold better that cracked the bread when you tried to spread butter on it. I started out with a bloody mary and I was impressed that they rimmed it with celery salt ( a nice touch ) but then after the vodka only added Mrs. T's Mix to it. Maybe this drink is out of style I don't really know but I thought a nice flavorful bloody mary with horseradish , maybe a dap of hot sauce and worcestershire would go really well with steaks in this old fashioned looking kind of place. Switched to wine it was fine.

Our server made the special salad of the evening sound really good and her story of the chef going out and picking the flowers from ocotillos impressed us so we split one of those salads to try. They did present us with two beautifully prepared salads. That were pristine fresh and had all the fruit and vegetables hand cut fresh to order. For me this might have been the high light of the meal. 

The rest was good for it's price point and I'd go back!

3.5 StarsOk liquor store overall.  Clean, decent selection, and friendly staff.  The prices are hit and miss as far as being much cheaper than anywhere else.  Some things are cheap, while others you can find cheaper somewhere else.This place is just okay. There are many rave reviews, and I feel like I may be missing something. I will give it another shot if I am in the area, but I don't see myself driving out of the way to eat here. Their buffet is fairly limited and most of the food lacked ANY spice factor. It was almost bland and some of it was overcooked. My favorite part was the rice and the naan. I did finish my small plate and had no desire for seconds. The meats were fatty and low quality and the buffet was not exactly cheap at $10.99 + tip. The owner seems like a nice gentleman and recognized my friend who worships this place. The service however was close to non existent and toward the end we felt rushed. I am a fan of Indian food and have sampled several places around town, and this would probably stack somewhere in the middle. I would be interested in trying their dinner items to see how they stack up in that category. Overall, just an okay Indian buffet with not much separating it from the rest of the pack other than the owner who seems to care about his return patrons.We have a love hate relationshipSo my girlfriend and I stayed at Aria and had a reservation for 2 months at The Steakhouse and the bubblehead woman at check in sat us at a horrible table so we will never go back.   If you don't take care of hotel guests, what's the point?   A group of 4 walked in with no reservation and sat next to us and complained about the table, so although our waiter was good and the food ok the experience was soiled by an idiot woman who sat us in Siberia.   Bad job!!!!!I actually almost forgot that my boyfriend and I ate here, which is probably not the best sign.  This review is strictly for the lounge area, though.  After seeing a show at the MGM, we walked back over to Aria for a drink and a quick bite.  It was late, and neither the restaurant nor the bar area were crowded.  As we weren't starving, we decided on the "pick four" from the kitchen on the lounge menu.  We tried the New England lobster roll, smoked salmon, truffled macaroni and cheese, and fish tostadas.  They were all pretty good, no doubt, but the bites were tiny.  I mean, tiny.  Maybe we underestimated how hungry we were, but I was a little disappointed.

The bartender was very pleasant.  The cocktail list didn't really cater to me (tequila drinker), but once I told him what I liked he chose something off the list and made it (the Diablo, I think?).  It wasn't the best drink I've ever had, but it was pretty good.  I wish he had used more creative license and crafted a drink of his own using the flavors I mentioned, but that's okay too.  I can't expect everyone to color outside of the lines!

I'm not sure if we would come back here as everything was just okay.  Nothing was negative, but there are just too many outstanding places in Las Vegas to dine to go somewhere "okay."Came here on NYE for lunch buffet. It was holiday pricing so my meal with bottomless champagne was $36. I'm not complaining because it's Vegas and it was NYE afterall. However, the food didn't impress me all too much. The king crab legs were my favorite. Very meaty and cut for you so all you have to do is "fork" out the meat and dip it in that butter! Breakfast food and dessert are good too. But the other foods lacked a bit. The Asian section was pretty weak. Just typical fried rice and noodles, some kung pao chicken. Standard pizza. Prime rib was very salty and way too well-done. I understand Aria is still new, but I don't think it made a very good impression on my friends and I. I would only come back if it were around $20, which I doubt.We got a complimentary buffet pass so we decided to use it here since it was right next to Vdara. Let's just say I wasnt impressed with their selection at all. They seem to offer a nice greasy variety for breakfast and for lunch it was random. We must have walked several rounds around the buffet trying to figure out what we should eat not because we were overwhelmed with the selection but because I couldn't figure what to eat with some of the selections they offered. Their mixed salads were extremely soggy and flavorless so there goes my excuse for attempting to eat healthy. I think I would give their dinner buffet a try next time but skipping out on their brunch since the selection was not too impressive during our experience.This is your typical serve yourself fro-yo... In general, I think I'm running out of steam with this concept.  For me, it's just getting old.  The cups are always so big.  I need to exercise a lot of self control to put that realistic amount of frozen yogurt in there and not go overboard.  Can't they have a normal size cup?  Just a rant-y sidebar; no stars off for this.  

We tried a sno-ball, which was really good.  They had a ton of flavors for these.  Considering that, in the summer, the Beach Bums Hawaiian Ice shack is only a little ways down the road - and they have more options as far as flavors and mixing with ice cream - I think I'd choose that over this.  

The store was clean.  There was sort of a photo enlargement gone wrong on the tables.  Anyone else notice this?  OK, so I'm just entirely too tuned into weird details. 

Good service and good product as far as serve-yourself frozen yogurt is concerned.Having lived in Saigon, I am picky about my pho. HLB knows what they are doing. The broths color, aroma and taste transports you from the Midwest to Vietnam. The Thai menu options are reliable, but the pho is the best you will find in Wisconsin.after reading all the great reviews, we decided to give this place a try. being from orange county, i came here with very low expectations as i know that all the vietnamese restaurants that i am close to at home will not be comparable. first bad impression, service was exceptionally slow. there were three tables when we came in that hadn't receive their food yet. one party actually left because it took THAT LONG! There were two young guys running the show that day and they seemed really lost and flustered. The vietnamese coffee tasted like nestle coffee--it didn't have the strong aromatic taste with savory sweetness that I'm use to. When our bun bo hue and pho sate FINALLY came 30minutes later, we were starving. My pho sate was great and it was much tastier than the bun bo hue (although it wasn't bad either). They also skimped on the veggies. So many asian restaurants are popping up in Vegas--I probably wouldn't come back here unless I'm craving pho sate.Good bar food.  Nothing too fancy,  but delicious food.  Great beer selection with a nice little outdoor patio.Now this review is a little biased because I don't know how I would actually feel to have to pay to get into Azure. Thanks to Alyssa once again, we were granted free entrance as well as a comped day bed with no minimum. Holla! 

It blew my mind to hear that not only there was a cover charge, but the day beds went for $300.00 - $400.00 with a minimum for drinks and food. Straight up robbin' suckas...

Azure is in the cut. As you walk to the main pool entrance on the 3rd floor of The Palazzo, take a right and you'll find Azure way in the back. There was a gentleman working the front door, slapped on our wrist bands and guided us to our day bed which was located right at the steps of the second pool. When you first walk in there is the hot tub, a few day beds and cabanas to the right. A few steps down was the second pool. All of them were shallow by the way, maybe four feet max. Day beds surrounded the pool and the cabanas aligned the outskirts. I hardly went on to the third pool because they all looked the same. The pool was clean and refreshing. Our day bed was in the perfect spot - catching both sun and shade from the palm trees. The crowd was older which I was very happy about. I needed a day to relax, listen to good music, good food and drinks. I was hardly in the mood for douchey musclemen sloshing drinks all over the place. Our server was cool and gorgeous. Came to check on us from time to time. We ordered drinks and food from Wolgang Puck's restaurant. The menu was very limited in the food department. Because all of us hadn't eaten since before we left Vegas, we splurged on hangover food. 3 margherita pizzas, fried calamari and bruschetta. Absolutely exquisite and well worth the $200.00. I had Bellini's poolside all day...mmm. 

The BEST part of Azure was the DJ. DEAR LORD - the guy is a GOD! Yes, he is THAT good. Since I got there by 1 p.m. - I only got to experience a 5 hour music set but I was blown away. ALL of my favorites - Deadmau5, Robin S., Bob Sinclair, Fedde LaGrande, Modjo, etc. I could go on. I got his business card so he should be emailing songs. At a certain point, most of us were dancing poolside or in the pool and the party was crackin'. Met the funniest latin bachelor party ever - roudy, douchey and drunk as &%#! By the end of the set, he had all of us in the pool cheering for more! One of the best trips to date ;) 

Pool closes @ 6 p.m.I've been hesitant to review Lolo's. I know everyone creams their pants upon its mere mention, but I really don't. I don't like fried chicken at all, and I'm generally too hungover in the morning to eat anything besides a gallon of gatorade, so I was afraid my review might only be relevant to a specific audience. Namely: Me.

But I wanted to review the Scottsdale location since I just went last weekend and have also been to the Phoenix location, so I figured the differences between the two might be worth pointing out. They both have good food, endearing servers, and awesome atmosphere. The differences are subtle, but noticeable. For instance, at the Phoenix location you get an ice cream scoop of warm, melty butter on your waffle. At the Scottsdale location you get a spoonful of cool, hard butter. I realize that waiting 5 minutes would solve this problem, but who has time to wait while there is a delicious breakfast pastry sitting right in front of your face?

Basically, everything was just a little different. Though this may have been in part because Coda B. and I split a 3 piece and he stuck me with the thigh.  Bastard.  He liked the grits better here but again, I liked them better at the other location.  Main reason: Not enough butter. I am in a race against time and if you think I'm going to die as a 95 year old healthy person you have another think coming. All of my decisions shave years off of my life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

They did have an awesome little gospel band there because it was Sunday. So I left feeling that much closer to God. And not just because I felt like i might have a cholesterol induced heart attack at any moment. 

I would say if you're not generally a fried chicken fan, I don't think Lolo's will blow your mind. If you want an awesome breakfast experience go to the Lolo's in Phoenix. If they're too busy, come to this one.Food=4.5 stars 
Location=2

I had been to the original location (pre-expansion) quite a few times, but this was my first try at the Scottsdale location.  It was CRAZY packed.  I tried going at 2pm on a Sunday, and there was not a single empty table...anywhere.  We were seated after a 30 minute wait, but we were so cramped that the whole experience was lackluster.  I will take the original location any day over the Scottsdale location.Not super impressed but overall good food, just seemed a little bit overpriced! The hubs and I found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. It was nice Bc we weren't rushed through our meal to give up our table. The waitress let us sit and cook and eat leisurely. We just left smelling like cooked meat Bc we stayed there too long.

The hubs enjoyed the beer--with the special refrigeration hing going on.

So overall--not the best good--but if you're looking for a more quiet place off the strip for some decent food, you can't go wrong!I stopped by for lunch last Sunday cause I saw the sign that said 2 for 1 on Sundays for a limited time. 

I ordered the Boardhouse Beef Dip ($7.45) and my friend ordered The Pastrami 'Nami($7.95). My sandwich was just ok. Her sandwich was dry and she didn't even eat half. 

We both got sodas with our sandwich and the bill was just over $12 with one free sandwich. 

I might come back and try something else.Two Hippies Dropped Out of College and Opened Up a Pizzaria, whew what a name eh? Well it's finally open and looks to be promising with only a few things to work out. Ill keep this one short and sweet without doing a disservice to the Hippies.  

First off there is NO place to eat here, its carry away only. We were actually going to have a few friends meet us up there but changed our minds after finding this out. Knowing this we still made the drive to Phoenix from Scottsdale to check it out, with mixed results though it is there second day. 

A killer thing about this place is the pricing. The 12" pizzas are $7 for either paper thin or hand tossed. If you don't specify, you get the hand tossed. They also have loads of different kinds of wings, $6 for a dozen. So many that its pretty hard to make a choice though we went with the Spicy BBQ and the Garlic Parmesan. The wings here are killer and worth ordering again! Sauced up nice and sloppy and perfectly tender, way to go!! Plus you also get a ton of carrots and ranch dressing. I can go on and on about the wings but this is after all a pizza place.

Okay, I'm not a fan of the pizza, well, not yet anyway. I have to cut them some slack since they just opened and might be still working out sourcing and such. We ordered 2 pizza's, the Sausage as well as the Cheeseburger. For $7 these are quite hefty and have ample toppings. The Two Hippies never skimp on ingredients! The bummer was that the sausage tasted right out of a bag, this is where the price point finally factors in. I would have preferred a better quality sausage, this stuff tasted much like the same stuff Papa John's might use, not good. The other problem is that the sauce was just tomato sauce and lacked any sort seasoning, including salt. The Cheeseburger suffered from the lack of seasoning as well though it was surly piled high with cheese, fresh tomatoes and ground beef. The crust was tender but for me, pizza crust should be chewy and crispy, this was neither. Maybe just a preference and I'm out of line. 

All in all I like the new Two Hippies pizzeria, though my feeling right now that it's just ordinary and not much different from a chain. Ill be sure to go back in a week or 2 to see how they are doing. Id imagine that they will be just fine!

PS.. the Pizzaria spelling isnt an error.. hmmm..This place has amazing food for most vegetarians.  I just ate here and had the "BBQ Pork" sandwich.  It was a little too sweet because it had too much coleslaw on it, but once I took it off the sandwich, the two separated were delicious!  We tried the curry and bean (or lentil, can't remember) soup that was their soup of the day, and it was extremely addicting, and so was their vegan ranch dressing I had on my side salad.  I honestly can't wait to go back and try other sandwiches there.

The only 2 reasons I only gave this place 3 stars, though, are:

1. Price - $9 got me the sandwich and a side salad, no drink.  When the sandwich came out, I was pretty disappointed in the size of it.  Sure enough, even with the side salad and half of the soup I split with my husband, I wasn't full after my whole meal.  They need to make these portions bigger, give you more sides, or drop their prices.

2. Service - the place was only half full, and there were 3 waitresses.  Ours was nice, nothing overly friendly or rude about her, just nice.  No one seated us right away, nor was there a sign saying if we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated, so my party of 4 just stood around trying to figure out what to do for about 3 minutes before someone even noticed we were there.  Once we were seated, we had enough time to look at the menu, and our waitress took our order.  The food didn't take too long to come out, but once we did have our food, I asked for more water and my husband asked for some hot sauce.  She only came back with the water after taking another table's order, cleaning the men's bathroom and cleaning 2 tables, by which time I was almost done with my extremely dry meal.  She then came over like she knew all along with the water, didn't apologize for the wait, and filled our glasses and dropped off the bottle of hot sauce (also after my husband was nearly done with his meal).  Lastly, it took her 20 minutes (I'm not kidding) from the time we finished her meal for her to clear our plates and get our checks to us, and that doesn't include running the cards and bringing back our receipts.  

Basically, this is a delicious place for extremely good vegetarian and vegan food, and I'm ecstatic that Madison has this cafe here, but in the future I think I'll just order things to go instead of suffer through 2 hours of my life trying to just eat a quick meal (with nothing to drink).I would give The Green Owl 4-5 stars for their food, but unfortunately their service really knocks them down. I came here with my boyfriend last week. After we were seated, it took us a little while to flag down our waitress so that we could order. We split an order of crabby cakes; my boyfriend ordered a bowl of chili with sour cream and cornbread, and I ordered the "meatball" sub with kale chips as a side. The crabby cakes came out very quickly, and they were covered with a delicious creamy sauce. We instantly devoured them. My boyfriend is a meat-eating tofu hater, and even he enjoyed these. Upon bringing out the crabby cakes, our waitress told us that our entrees should be out "very soon."

Our food didn't arrive for another 40 minutes, and our waitress never stopped by to assure us that it was on its way or to explain what was causing the delay. Oh well. The food, once it did get to our table, was delicious. My sandwich was piping hot, the bread roll was crispy, and the eggplant meatballs held up well in the sandwich (they weren't mushy) and were flavorful.

I would've liked to try a dessert, but $6 for an average sized portion was a little too steep. 

I will probably come back to the Green Owl. Even though the service is lacking, there are so many more items on the menu I'd like to try!I go to this location occasionally when I need to pop in for something organic.  It's a very clean store however they don't have a large selection on vegetables or fruit.  I have to go to sprouts if I want a better organic selection for this type of item.   They do have organic milk creamer some organic cheeses but I haven't seen any organic meat.  It's very good just to pop in and grab something when I'm out.   If I need a lot of things I'll go to Trader Joe's or sprouts but this is great for convenienceThe wife and I went here prior to a show at the Colosseum.  We decided to try the five course tasting menu with match wine.  
Negatives: Overall, I was a disappointed.  There were only three different wines which didn't start until we were on our third course.  The sauvignon blanc served with the lobster didn't pair at all.  My wife's seared sea bass was tempura-ed and very fishy.  Normally, when one orders a paired wine service, that service includes poring the wine in front of the guest with a brief description of the wine and why it was chosen for that particular course.  The only piece of information we received was, "this is an xxxx, enjoy".  

Positives:  The staff was very attentive and accommodating.  The space is extremely pleasant and relaxing.  The Pinot Noir and desert Muscat were excellent.  (It would have been nice to have seen the bottle they were poured from.  I would have found them at the wine store and purchase a few bottles.)

I think we might go back sometime and try ordering A la carte.This past Wednesday happened to be their 2-year anniversary and we were fortunate enough to be there for the free appetizer / drink coupon as a result.  Drinks were great -- definitely liking the laid back, tropic vibe.  Food was decent (macadamia encrusted mahi, ribs), but didn't raise the bar for food of this type.  Only downfall was service -- our appetizer never made it, and extra drink did (not complaining about that!), had to ask for our waiter on a few occasions, and the check took a lot longer than would be expected.

My bottom line:  Would love to hit this place at happy hour or late night drinks, but would probably look elsewhere if I were looking for an above-average meal.I have driven by this place numerous times and have been wanting to check it out.  Ever since Trader Vic's closed at the Valley Ho I have been needing a spot that will fulfill my not-too-frequent mai tai fix. I was there on a Wed night to meet up with some business buddies and the place was doing brisk business. I think they have an all night happy hour on Wed night, which was convenient.
Its a cool set up especially when the weather is nice. Very open bar that leads out to a big patio with lots of seating. Gilligan's Island episodes playing on a large projector is a cool touch as well.
I am a big believer that a proper gentleman knows to order margs at a mexican food joint, wine at an Italian or French place and good beer and whiskey every place else. That being said, when frequenting a super kitschy tiki hut standard operating procedure is the house mai tai. Very tasty, not too sweet and a bit boozy. I also had some HH pork tacos that were massive and pretty decent for soaking up the 5 mai tais. I would go back for the patio and the aforementioned MAI TAIS.The location is great for those who live on the west side, near the movie theater also. The Yumburger was soggy. Palabok, Spaghetti and Chicken Joy was acceptable. The restaurant overall was clean and I like the fact that it's right next to Red Ribbon. 

I thought the "Chicken and Burgers" sign under the Jollibee sign was brilliant, it can attract audience not familiar with the brand.

Near the restroom area a saw a party section if you do decide to have a kid's party. It's tucked at the back of the store.The room was clean,  couch and bed were very comfortable. It's a great spot to rest after a long night partying. 

Only bad thing is that it's kinda far from the strip, so you'll pay more for cab fare to and from the hotel. 

A nice thing is there's  a CVS near by so you can stock up on water, snacks etc.We have been going here since it opened.  Last visit being 5/26 and we received NO bean dip with our chips.  One of my favorite things. I hope this was just a mistake. I was definitely disappointed!So I went here the other day on the Tour de Coffee de Phoenix... ftw. I ordered my usual... a latte and the BF got a mocha (the... unusual I guess). My latte was fine, not the best, but fine. It was a little watery... I think this may be due to the barista, not the coffee. That is a trend I see with Matt Pool's places.... bad service. We got here and waited like 5 minutes for someone to come out of the back and help us.... kinda weird. Also, it took the barista about 10 minutes to make a latte... whoa. Anyway, the reason for the low star -age is the BF's mocha.... ugh. It tasted like a hot chocolate milk made with hershey's syrup. No coffee flavor. No intense chocolate flavor. Just bad flavor. They do have a cool way to pay with a credit card.... on an ipad....and the space is cool looking, but I probably wouldn't go back.Mamita's is a place that offers pleasant neglect. Our waitress was obviously new and that played a part in our spotty service. When she had time she refilled our chips frequently. No drinks were refilled throughout our dinner and the table was only set after we got our food. 

The food is ok. Nothing spectacular. The combos are cheap at under $10 a plate and the food is plentiful. Most of the Cuban plates came with rice, black beans, and plantains. The rice was under cooked and not fluffy. The beans were good. The copious amount of plantains were a godsend. I was not super hungry so I just shared a bit of my friends' plates and an order of the Yucca Con Mojo. I was probably the happiest with the side items. 

The best part about Mamita's is their video dj. They play a mix of 80's-90's music and it is stuff you have not heard in ages. The atmosphere is a mixture of club and restaurant. People will get up in the middle of the meal and start dancing. There is no hate, because when your jam comes on, it is hard to contain it.A walk down the Royal Mile from Edinburgh Castle is a good way to see a snap-shot of the life in this part of the city. I think if it is convenient you should start at the castle, from here you'll get a view north over the Princess Street Gardens or South to the Meadows.


 Near the castle is generally mobbed with tourists, I would recommend if you can don't visit anything in Edinburgh during the main festival season of August, the rest of the year it can be very busy but not crazy busy.


 Heading down the mile towards Holyrood Palace is strange as you get further from the pure tourist attraction of the castle and closer to Holyrood, a working royal residence , you also get further from the shops selling a load of rubbish and passing it of as authentic, traditional and Scottish, beware any tiny shop describing itself as a factory outlet or clearance sales.So Basically, Brown is the New Black and H&M is the new Forever 21.Sweets and beats is a great concept. What's not to like about candy and vinyl?

Having heard about this great concept only recently I decided I must drop by so this last weekend we did. I'm not sure if we were greeted upon entry but we did talk to the guy behind the counter and he seemed friendly enough. 

The candy selection wasn't huge but that didn't stop my kid from finding some sort of candy to want. There was also some potato thing that piqued my interest but I didn't get, maybe next time.

The vinyl selection was small as well but I found titles to my liking though I didn't go through everything there did seem to be a lack of genres. It seemed like the overall emphasis was on punk or ska as far as the vinyl goes which works for me but not everyone else.

I think it's a great concept, there's some novelty stuff, some dvd's some records and some candy. I'd love to see more records and candy. If both sections were made a little bigger this place would easily trump stinkweeds and smeeks as far as I'm concerned and imagine being able to do that all in one shop instead of having to go out the door and walk over two shops.

For now I give it a 3 but if they play their cards right they could take a 5 in no time.

pros:
candy
records
records i like
seemingly friendly staff

cons:
small amount or records/lack of variety in records
could use more candy
i'm not too hip on that part of town
cash onlyDefinitely not as good as the original but I like hot dogs! Had the Polish pastrami and it was delicious! Loved eating outdoors under the umbrellas. But otherwise, not that spectacular.Overpriced touristy destination. You're basically paying for the location, not the food. I wouldn't say it was bad or good, just overpriced. When getting the check, the waiter overcharged us for some drinks. He had to go into the back and change it twice after 5 minutes of explaining each time.I'd been wanting to go to FnB for the longest time and based on reviews and word of mouth I was excited. I knew that meals could be pricey, but I didn't mind based on how good the food was supposed to be.

My friends and I had a reservation so there was no issue with having to wait once we arrived and that was awesome.  When I got there I was promptly greeted. The staff was very friendly and didn't have the attitude that people accuse servers at Scottsdale restaurants to have.

We took a little time to decide what we wanted to drink and the staff was fine with us taking time to make a decision. When we did order our wine was served within a reasonable time...except for my glass. And once everyone else's drinks were delivered the server seemed to disappear. It probably took about 15 minutes for a server to come back so I could ask for my wine that never got served. I got my wine shortly after asking for it, but no apology for the error, which I didn't care for. Felt a bit like an "oh well" situation.

When it was time to order, I had wanted the salmon but was informed they were out. I could somewhat understand this though as we had a later reservation (8 pm). I decided to order the pasta with sausage instead. The dish had good flavor (great seasoning and not too salty) and was a good portion size. The herbs in the dish were fresh and flavorful. Was it an entree worth the $19 price tag...not in my opinion.

Now that I've been, I can say I've been, but don't have to go back.Tried it last week went in with a few folks after reading about it here not to impressed waffles were good but nothing out of this world all 4 of us tried something different off the menu including the waffle pizza 
was disappointed in the smoothies tasted jus like ice end up throwing it away
if i go back itll be for the breakfast sandwich with eggs cheese ham and bacon.....Panera: it is what it is.  

A perfectly adequate place for coffee, a sandwich, pastries, whatever.  (OK--I take the coffee part back, because I've been to several different locations and have never cared for the coffee.)  The service has been fine the few times I've been here. The food is okey-dokey but completely unremarkable. I'd describe what I ate today, but why bother? I already don't remember what it was.  See what I mean?  An unintended plus to today's outdoor dining experience: being entertained as I watched people react with varying degrees of horror as they clapped their peepers on a couple of mice frolicking under one of the tables. But I digress.  

In sum: if you come here for fine dining you're bound to be disappointed (p.s. you're bonkers, so you deserve what you get).  

Panera: at the pinnacle of mediocrity.  It is what it is.The place finally opened, with a name like Mellow Mushroom, we were wondering what the fuss would be all about.  The place was packed on a Monday night.  The theme is interesting, a lot of subtle references to the hippieness that seems to outline this restaurant, waiters were wearing shirts that say "Baked Since 1974", the appetizers are called munchies... Hilarious.   It was loud, so loud that the music was faint, to a point where it was a little irritating, though the atmosphere for a Pizza place has a lot of potential. 

The decor is interesting aswell, a few photographs of Phoenix as it is today, which shows the owner's love for the locals and this valley.  The food as I witnessed was fair, intresting combinations on their specialty pizzas, on paper that is.  When the pizzas slowly came out of the kicthen  there was a lot of dough surrounding the toppings in the center of the pie.  Honestly, the pizzas were not there yet, as far as taste and presentation, surely and hopefully that is only due to newly trained staff in the kitchen. 

Double orders were flying out, clearly miscommunication from the waiters to the kitchen...  Give this place a couple months at least, they should have their act together by Valentine's day. Let's hope.  The Stuffed Portebello "Munchy" (appertizer) was very good, though when it came with some really nice mixed greens on the side as an accompanying salad, it was overpowered  by a very thick balsamic glaze (supposedly a reduction)  The dish would have been perfect without the overdrizzle of that dark thick sauce...  Overall, it looks like the Mellow Mushroom is possibly working out their kinks, though the waitress should have never admitted that to our faces. 

There's potential, the menu is clean and simple, the staff must now back the reputation of this unique Pizzaria, since it does have to compete with Sauce, around the corner with very tasty dough and a much more professional cooking staff.  Possibly the best thing it has going is the extensive beer list that is on tap, the Purple Haze is okay  and very popular, the Apricot beer there is something else.  Good job on those GM, though pretzels? Stick to the theme: Pizza.I'm a bit of a Greek food snob and this place didn't do it for me.  It's certainly not bad but nothing stood out.  Very flat pita bread with minimum Tzatziki application.  The lettuce didn't seem fresh and their fries are served very undercooked.

On a positive note the seasoning on the fries is good and they were plenty busy.  $7.50 for a drink, Gyro and fries is a fair price.Needed to change it up from all the BBQ I was eating, and randomly decided on Thai Spices.  Ok, I lied...AA Wholesome Bakery:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/aa-wholesome-bakery-mesa#hrid:Du4wIG5ktu3GqqAeHFjqfg) is in the same complex :P

Pad Kee Mow:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s5TJlFtdXcx_tXC4tlttlw?select=KkVkifgnEk1d60wVCwixNQ .  I like a little spiciness with my thai dishes, but the levels (low, medium, and high) all vary!  Thankfully, the medium spiciness here, was aligned with what I considered medium :)

Thai Panang:   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s5TJlFtdXcx_tXC4tlttlw?select=jf6GntlWc0n8L__ehq8ROg .  But this was my favorite dish, the curry was so rich with flavor and had a nice kick to it. 

Up until this point, Thai Spices locked in a 4 star rating, until I ordered a side of sticky rice ($2) to eat with the rest of my curry.  I wish I took a picture, but the rice was served in a little bamboo container, and when I lifted the lid, there was rice wrapped in plastic wrap.  

WTH is this?!  $2 for rice that's barely half my palm size, AND it was served in plastic food wrap!  0_oShula's is located on the second floor of the Wild Horse Pass Hotel and Casino. There is a bit of walking to get to the restaurant and the ventilation in the casino needs some work. However, once inside the restaurant, any smell from the casino seems to disappear.

I made a reservation using OpenTable a week before as I assumed the restaurant might have a lot of guests since my work and another large group were attending conferences in the area and staying in the hotel. No matter the combination of time and party size, there was only one spot available. When I entered the restaurant, there were many open tables available. 

The service here is a hit and miss. The receptionist seemed like a snob, not saying a word when I told them my name and reservation time. They just grabbed menus and gave me a look to follow. Maybe this person was too good for my group and I? We were also introduced to two rather enthusiastic waitresses which I didn't mind at all, but were absent quite a bit during our meal.

I didn't get a tour of the restaurant like some of the fellow reviewers had, but I was perfectly without it. I felt that the football and the menu of the steaks on it is a nice touch (luckily it was not placed on top of our plate) and the cart showing how each cut of steak looks is neat. I opted for the cowboy steak (medium rare) while my coworkers order the filet mignon (medium). 

My cowboy steak was cooked perfectly while also having a little crust. I honestly felt that it was delicious. My coworkers filet mignon appeared to be good and they enjoyed it. We also ordered the lobster mashed potatoes and crab mac and cheese. The lobster mashed potatoes were decent while the crab mac and cheese were not special. Both seemed to have a subpar amount of seafood.

Prices are comparable to any steakhouse. I might come back when I attend another conference in the area and too lazy to drive to the restaurants off Ray Road.Went here on a Friday night. There was quite a huge line but we managed to slide in pretty quick on the side for table service do that was nice.
Being local girls it was free to get in as well as free bubby & tequila til midnight.
It was around then the club really started popping. Lottsa people on. The dance floor. I was kinda surprised at the quality of the go go girls. A few of them had some tummy pooches & could not move for anything.
The music is mostly hip hop as well.
But it's a good place for guys since there were a crazy amount of women there for the free drinks.One of my favorite sporting goods store is Dick's Sporting Goods.  Not many in California and not many here in Las Vegas.  So, I'm finding myself driving a ways just to get to one.  You can compare a Dick's to Sports Authority, but I tend to find what I'm looking for here.  Usually come here for Under Armour and Nike clothing for my workouts.  It's ironic that I can usually find what I'm looking for here over the actual Nike and Under Armour Stores.  Plus, this location is a pretty big size with two levels. 

My only issue is their customer service.  My first 3 times I've been here, I received zero customer service.  Seems like I always have to reach out to an employee even though there's plenty standing around just talking to each other.  I know what I want when I go to a sporting goods store, but when I need to try something on I need someone to unlock the dressing rooms.  Would be nice for once if I didn't have to go all the way to the front and always ask for someone.  

So on my last visit I didn't expect customer service to be any better.  In fact, I asked someone to unlock the dressing rooms before I even started my shopping because I knew what I would have to go through.  Bought a couple of white workout tanks on my last visit and the cashier made a comment that I am buying "wife beaters".  Seriously, people still talk that way? Kind of a sterotype in my opinion.  

I give this place 4 stars for selection and 2 stars for service.  Overall rating is a 3, especially since I know I will be back to eventually buy something.Service is never consistent. Some times everything is amazing, but days like today, I repeated my orde twice through drive thru, interrupted twice, charged for water bottle that thet ended up not having, which is fine, not a big deal, but my wrap was soggy and my smoothie wasn't even the right smoothie. I ordered a lean machine (strawberries bananas and weight management with energizer), I have something with maybe acai and  maybe blueberries. I love Tropical Smoothie and I LOVE that this place has a  drive thru, but damn, if it's the speaker please get a new one, and if today was just a shitty day, maybe I'll have better luck the next day.Simple, good enough Mexican food.  I can only imagine that AZ has WAY better Mexican food, as Kansas City has places that are leaps and bounds above this place...but it was tasty enough.

We arrived around 7:00 and were one of the last tables to be sat before the whole place was full.  Our waitress was quick and attentive and got our drinks to us.  Margaritas were pretty standard, but slightly strong.  Bonus!

Chips were stale.  They came out with three salsas: a spicy, DELICIOUS tomatilla sauce (which I loved, and I usually don't like tomatillas.  Pleasant surprise!), a mild salsa and a hot chipotle salsa.  The menu says chip refills are .95 cents after the first free basket, but our waitress took the basket and refilled it twice without asking us.  Hmm.  Not sure if that was added on the bill...mom paid (Heyo!) but she didn't say anything so maybe we lucked out.

Our food took quite a while to get out, but I saw a guy carrying out HUGE trays full of plates out to the patio so perhaps we got in right behind those parties.  I ordered the tamales, but ordered two of the green chile variety, instead of one of those and a beef one, as the menu states.  These were...OK.  Lots and lots and lots of masa and barely any filling.  They were covered in a tasty verde sauce and some tasteless cheese.  Since this was technically an appetizer, I ordered a side of black beans (VERY yum) and guacamole (pretty fresh, but I'm an avocado-obsessed freak so I was going to like it either way) but I was so stuffed and only ate half of each tamale.

This place was pretty standard and had some high points, but didn't blow me away.  Their patio would probably be very fun during a warm summer night.  Perhaps another trip!The culinary dropout looks like a interior design dropout  designed it.  The big comfy seats really aren't made for eating meals in. The waitress was nice. The pretzel fondue was pretty damn tasty. I ordered the bistro steak. It was just ok. The side of Fries were very good, but the blu cheese sauce was just not that good and the quality of steak wasn't wonderful. The experience as a whole was just ok. My girlfriend however loved the sandwich she ordered.The food was good, but the service was strange. We called to get a reservation and at 6:30, they said the soonest they had open was 8:15. We tried to clarify if they had ANYTHING sooner, answer was no. Fine, ok, we thought we'd just have drinks at the bar until then. We got there and sat at the bar, and realized the restaurant had only an 1/8th of the tables filled. I assumed the tables were all reserved and that was why we couldn't sit. The hostess could have let us know we were welcome to eat at the bar tables. We were sat at 8:15 by the bartender, as it was obvious there was plenty of room, which was still empty by then. It was just a really strange experience to have such an empty restaurant have people sitting at the bar wanting to eat, but not sitting anyone (the people beside us were also waiting for a table). The restaurant still had over half, maybe 3/4 of the tables empty when we left. Maybe this was an isolated thing, but it was so uncomfortable I have unpleasant memories.The only thing impressive is the size of their food

Food not very impressive just big.  I had the chicken and waffles and it was a bit greasy. The giant biscuits were good and the waitress was very friendly.While in Vegas, my friend insisted that we had to eat at Hash House. We came as a group of 12 on a busy Saturday morning. The hostess told us the wait would be about an hour or more. So, we split up into groups of 4, and ended up waiting about 20 minutes instead. Not bad at all!

My group ordered 3 dishes (way more than enough for 4 hungry people!) Me and two other friends shared the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and the Meatloaf Hash. Both were delicious! We were so hungry and tired (from the night before!), that I can't even remember what was all in our food. I just remember it being delicious. 

The restaurant was super busy and service was kind of slow, but the food was definitely worth the wait! I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas!I like this location, but one thing they need to keep the music low inside so you can hear yourself talk with a group of individuals or phone calls.

Very friendly staff.When this place first opened I was very impressed with the quality of their food, but lately I  have felt let down. I have received soggy, overly salty, and small burritos the last several times I've ordered from them. Also, the customer service is awful. I go here later at night, so I can not attest to their early morning service like some of the other reviewers. They do get some starts for their salsa bar, their carne asada fries, rolled tacos, and for being clean. I wont be going back here though. With so many Mexican food places in the area, I'm sure you can find a place with better food and service.I've been to this location a few times and can't brag or complain about the service/quality of the drinks. I've been here where service in the drive thru was fast and friendly, and I've been here where I am the only one in the drive thru and my drink has taken over 5 minutes to receive. Hit or miss.Went here for lunch yesterday. Was pleasantly surprised that they brought out some tasty chicken soup almost as soon as I sat down, in the style of a Korean restaurant. Apparently the soup comes with every meal. I ended up ordering the Pad Ba Mee (noodles and fried egg) with chicken, and it was good. Nothing outstanding, but good. 

They didn't leave a mint with the check, though, which I consider a must for any restaurant that serves a lot of spicy food. Besides that, everything else was fine. Giving this 3 rather than 4 stars because nothing really jumped out at me as being great. It also doesn't have much of a homey feel.I ordered a frozen coffee and when I received it, it was runny and lacked flavor and was way over priced. I'll stay going to Starbucks!We have only ever ordered this for take-out, and overall it's pretty good.  The part I absolutely love is the fact that you can order online. They have always got our order correct, despite the fact that I always fill up with "Notes" section with my extra requests.  The delivery people have been friendly and quick.  

As far as the food, it is definitely not my favorite Chinese ever, however, the flavors are decent and they give you a pretty fair portion.  We always go with the General Tso's chicken, Lo Mein, and Dumplings.  Go with fried dumplings, as opposed to the steamed (they're always kind of flimsy).  Lo Mein is normally pretty good.  The ease of online ordering and the fact that overall it's been good is what keeps us still eating Hot Wok.I'd been noshing on chips with guac at most places around town during a time warp in which I was, coincidentally, avoiding the gym. I finally hauled my petite yet burdened frame to Lifetime for some cardio and then decided to reward myself with more chips with guac :)
However, to cut a long story short, the menu board was angled in such a way that rolled tacos with guac sounded even better. I thought they would be like 'berto's cause everything about the menu & signage reminded me of it....but it wasn't :( The tacos were skinnier, the guac a bit thinner, and the sauce not so caliente. 
I think a hard-core gym rat like me deserves better - I'm gonna give it another shot for breakfast one day soon after I've pumped some iron or at least driven by Lifetime again :PMy eye doctor was friendly.  The staff is hit or miss - some of the receptionists are friendly and some are not.  I would have given them 4 stars if they stayed open later than 5 - it's difficult to leave work early just to pick up your glasses or contacts.  The prices are reasonable and on par for other optometry offices.A legitimate massage joint. You keep your clothes on for great massages that beat out other chain establishments at a fraction of the cost!

It's a very affordable place since an hour massage only costs 25$ as of this writing.  With a 5 dollar tip, that's 30 out-the-door.  Usually 60+ at most other massage places.

The people actually have massage therapy licenses and they're hanging on the wall to the left as you enter.  

I've been coming here weekly for the past two months and it's been really good.  The only reason I did a minus two on the stars is because last time I was here, I drifted off... Only to wake up and find the masseuse also half-asleep and barely moving his hands.  When I slightly moved my body to act as if I was waking up, he went back into full force.  

I guess I don't really feel it or enjoy it if I'm asleep but I don't think that makes it right for him to not massage if I've drifted off...

I guess my advice is for you to not fall asleep?I'd never been here before but I heard they had good post workout shakes so I decided to give it a try. I asked the guy what he would recommend for me and he was really rude. Felt like he was judging me for not knowing what to order. I ended up getting the strawberry banana meal replacement shake. It was not my favorite. Tasted like chemicals. I've gone one more time and received the same horrible service from some woman. She didn't greet me when I walked in, was very short when I ordered and didn't bother saying thanks or have a good day. What bugged me even more was that she was extremely friendly to the guy who was in there. Guess you have to have ridiculous muscles and know what to order to feel welcome! But to be honest, I really liked the chocolate peanut butter shake that I got the second time and I'll go back for another one....until I find a better place close to home!Rediscovering chick-fil-a. Love the chicken nuggets and chicken sandwiches.  this place is addicting.  I used to have this all the time back in college and now I remember why.  What a refreshing blast from the past.I stayed at this hotel for a Bachelorette Party weekend and we were left disappointed.  The hotel itself... is immaculate! There are so many blinged out touches that you are just left in awe.  The stores are a unique and I walked through each one, wanting something from every place I went to.  Also, everything is automated here.  The parking stalls each have a light that changes from red to green if the stall is taken or available.  The rooms are also controlled on a master system so that lighting can be turned on/off from the television, a master switch at the entrance or by the front desk when someone checks in/out.  The best part had to be the Marquee nighclub/dayclub.  This would be the only reason I would want to come back to this hotel.

A couple things I didnt like:

*HORRIBLE SERVICE - The best service came from their valet/bell boys.  Seriously, these guys were friendly and on top of their stuff.  The front desk needs to be put in check.  We had people that got checked in to rooms that already had other guests in there, we asked for adjoining rooms and were switched rooms multiple times because they could not figure this out and we were delivered an incorrect room service order which they would not credit until they physically came to our room to investigate it.  This was at 2am ... and we had to stay up and wait for someone to come to the room because they couldnt credit a sandwich.

*HORRIBLE SIGNAGE - I guess this place was intended to be used for residential condos but you can never figure out where you're going.  There are multiple pools and there's no way to figure most of them out without asking someone.  The pool we were trying to get to was on a floor shared by the conference center, had no signs pointing you in the right direction when you got out of the elevators and you had to go out a set of doors that looked like an emergency exit to another set of doors that didnt mark that a pool was there.

I think the hotel in general needs new management but the pool and the valet/bell service were phenemonal.I'm not going to write much, because, well, everyone else seems to have written books on this place.

I'll sum it up easily:

rooms are awesome. not only the look and feel, but the amenities are all cool.

games are awesome. the greyhound racing game is probably the funnest casino game I've ever played.

the hotel atmosphere is...too "cool" for me. Looking at "sexy" women and douche-bag guys all day gets tiring. Seriously, how many black dresses and jeans with dress shirts can you see in one place? Maybe some people enjoy that, though. By the way, black dresses can't slim down fat and dress shirts don't make beer bellies look sweet. 

the food here is great. especially secret pizza (even more so after several mojitos).

I don't think I'd go back for a few years when, hopefully, Vegas changes it's landscape again.As for the Hotel: 

I've stayed at this hotel now 6 times. I really like it. The rooms are large and the bathrooms are awesome. However, there's *always* something that's just a bit off or missing that surprises me. Last time, there was no water in the minibar when I checked-in. OK, so they forgot it. But, upon check out, they charged me for it, as the items in the mini-bar are automatically billed upon no weight being sensed at the sight each item sits. I had to explain that there never was any water. Another time, neither tv worked in my room. Also, this time, the ashtray in the balcony was filled w/ cigarette butts. None of these are the end of the world, but, like I said.....details.

As for the Casino itself, Not so good.  

This is a very small, boutique-type casino. I've played a lot of craps throughout Vegas and world. I watched a craps dealer just rip a poor woman player because she had placed her bet in the wrong "section" of the dont come box. He then proceeded to give her winnings to another player, and when she questioned him on it he accused her of lying. Unbelievable! Having witnessed the whole thing while playing at the same table, I came to her aid and told the pit boss, who came over, and I told him to re-wind the tape upstairs. They then reluctantly gave her her winnings. This place has consistently arrogant / cocky workers. Right now, they're a hot, new, 'in' place, but that will soon die down, and I expect this place to be pretty spartan and empty. They need a management make-over, and fast. I recommend you Gamble and bring your business and hard earned $$ else where.The pizza was good.  I loved the crust.  However the Caesar salad sucked.  The croutons were soft and there wasn't enough dressing.  The beer selection was just OK.  So sorry, one star lost.The pizza was good, but WAY overpriced.  They start with a basic pizza then toppings are extra.  $2 for jalapenos? $2 for onions?  Seriously?Dunkin Donuts is good for donuts, and I hear is quite legendary for coffee, which I can't review since I don't drink coffee.

I had their $4 breakfast sandwich called "Big N' Toasted" which has eggs, bacon, cheese (but I ordered it without the cheese, and it's on a very buttered (almost too greasy) Texas toast slices.  It's a tasty sandwich that while eating it you know it's not good for you health wise, or rather, there are healthier alternatives I'm sure.

The donuts are good, not outstanding to die for like some feel about certain donuts whether it's their competitor, "Krispy Kreme", "Rolling Pin", "Winchell's" or whichever... to me, a donut is a donut, so long as it's not stale, so I'm not a connoisseur of donuts (and don't like bagels much either)   

I like the Boston Kreme chocolate covered one, as well as the apple fritter, each at around $1, which isn't bad.

The service is organized, fast and friendly, and the parking is ample and easy, located in an outdoor shopping mall area.I'm gonna start off by saying that I think most of the time, Panorama is easily a 4+ star building. However, since we moved in 5 months ago, 3 of the months there has been significant construction going on. The construction is loud, frustrating and a massive annoyance. At one point for about 2 weeks straight, an OUTRAGEOUSLY loud drill was being operated every morning, sometimes as early as 6am(I legitimately got under 2 hours of sleep a night). 

Other than the construction however, pretty much everything about Panorama is great. The location, staff, security and amenities are all A+. I'm very excited for the construction to finally be over so I can change this to a 5 star.Short and simple. Love the store, don't care for the workers. Some days I'll have one that actually wants to help, but I've had worse service.Decent seafood for a hole in the wall. I would not go back there again though.Got a pauly.  Heard it was good. Not terrible. Papa Geo's gets the point thoI'm a pedicure junkie - I like to get my toes done at least once a month, I don't care if it's too cold out for anyone to ever see them but me!  So, a couple of months ago, I moved to a new part of town.  Classic Nails is up the street from my new place (along with about 600 other salons), and I decided to pop in...

Pros:
1. Reasonably priced (I think my spa pedi was $25+tip)
2. Comfy massage chairs
3. No wait
4. Brought me a bottle of water
5. Trashy magazines to read (ie "People," not "Hustler")
6. Toes looked great at the end

Cons:
1.The lady hurt me a few times with the cuticle trimmers and the slougher.  When I exclaimed, "Ow!' for the third time, she said, "You have sensitive feet!'  Yeah, sensitive to being cut open!

2. My pedicure started chipping a bit after a week.  And normally I can go about three weeks before anything even starts to get sad.

Overall, it was a decent place - but I will probably keep looking.  There are too many nail salons around to settle!

Last week I had a girl friend in town, and I took her to my old place, T Nail Spa, @ 4616 W. Sahara.  It's further away, but at least I knew I'd get a good pedi and no pain!I'm glad I visited and the price is right since admission is free. I would have liked it more if they had a greater variety of artifacts. It's just a lot of the same stuff. 
The parking is metered and I paid for two hours worth of parking but I was through everything in about an hour.I used to hear a lot about this place when I lived in Chicago. It was actually recommended by a few of my friends. Unfortunately, I never got a chance to try it due to a sudden relocation to San Diego. But then I found out that they opened a few locations out here and took it as a "sign" to go and try the place before I suffer in regrets again. My guy has been dying to try this place and we finally got around to it on Tuesday. Three stars because it really was "A-Ok." 
I love the atmosphere here, it felt "homey." It's small AND quiet (bonus!), but then again there weren't a lot of people dining in that day. The gentleman behind the counter was real friendly and helpful with questions that we had about the food. 

We ordered:
Catfish w/ two chicken wings & drumstick- I really liked the fish, it had good flavor to it and was very moist. I didn't try the wings but the bf said it was "okay." BUT, added that it was "real moist." And it really was. As he sank his teeth in to that drumstick, all that chicken juice started dripping down his chin. No joke.
Fried okra and mushrooms- It was bland, and that's probably an understatement.  
Fries(came with the combo)- Although it was fried to my liking, it lacked flavor as well.

Total cost: around 25 bucks. Would we go back again? Absolutely, but It's one of those places I would probably go to once in a blue moon.Damn harolds gonna knock you down one star, last time I visited was a disappointment. The cook must've reached the bottom of their seasoning batter or perhaps the wings were brined for too long cause my wings were pretty salty..Not a great whole foods, seems like a wannabe whole foods, not alot of selection and set up weird, they need to do something to change the feel of the storeI think their food is great. Have never been disappointed by the quality. But I do have the say, the service is somewhat lacking. I've only been here at night, when it was dead, so I didn't have much to say about that. But then I went here during their lunch rush and it was awful. Chipotle gets just as busy and I am in and out in 10 - 15 minutes flat. At Smashburger it took me 40 minutes to get my salad. 40 minutes!? Then on top of that, the lady gave me the incorrect order. I got all the way to my car and thankfully had the inkling to look before driving away. I came back and they gave me the correct order, but didn't apologize. And the woman said, "I tried to catch you before you left. I'm glad you came back." Umm how hard did you try exactly? You must've whispered my name.

I won't stop going here because of that, I'll just never ever go during lunch again. I suggest you take a note from Chipotle, maybe change up how you take or give the orders, because 40 minutes for a salad is absurd.We had dinner at the Beach House on Friday on our way up to northern Wisconsin based on reviews on Yelp.  If you are looking for good fish fry the Beach House has it.  I had the perch which was great, my bf had the walleye which i think had an even better flavor.  The fish deserves 5 stars.  Everything else a 3 star.  I would give 3 1/2 stars if that were an option.  Would definitely go back.The food is decent, the service is better than your average Madison restaurant and the bathrooms were clean.  It is a bit out of our way but it is consistent enough to warrant more visits.Tons of shoes for women, some for men, zilch for kids.  Huge clearance section, but not all deals are really that great.  Good place to go if you're pretty self-serve and have a general idea of what shoes cost elsewhere.  Their rewards program is pretty generous- $10 back for every couple hundred you spend- not a hard limit to meet.This is gonna be a difficult review to write and I don't want anyone to take it the wrong way.  Smoky Jons is good.  I mean, it's smoked, slow-cooked, sauce-covered, deliciously unctuous dead pig.  By nature, it's delicious and awesome and good for your soul.

But all barbecue is good.  Good barbecue is great.  Smoky Jons is...Good.

I'm in Madison a few times a week for work and we've driven by this place a hundred times and every time said "We should stop in here".  We finally did yesterday.

The interior is nice, an order counter, a few tables, and a log-cabin'esque interior.  An okay place to eat lunch.  The menu is pretty expansive, with a good selection of sandwiches, platters, combos, sausages, sides, desserts, etc.  Whatever you like, meat-wise, you can find it here.

After perusing the menu, I decided on the chopped pork shoulder dinner plate.  I should say my family is from Tennessee and I grew up on chopped pork.  I grew up eating at shady back-country Tennessee BBQ places with dirt floors and plank counters and a weathered old man in the back basting a pig.  Barbecue is in my blood.

Smoky Jons was not up to par.  The meat was delicious, but not smoky at all.  You literally could not taste the pit, or the smoke, or the fire.  The sauce was good too, but soooo sweet.  I guess I grew up on a vinegar sauce and I realize that sauce is an intensely regional thing, but this was not what I enjoyed.

The sides were excellent.  Coleslaw is great.  Beans are perfect.  Sugar biscuits are delish.

Honestly, this is the best BBQ I've had in Madison.  But I've had better at several places in Milwaukee.  And I've had better at countless places in the south.

I know Smokey Jon's is apparently world-renowned for their BBQ so you should probably try it yourself, and honestly I'll probably go back again.

My favorite though?  No.

A-OK?  Yes, certainly.I had lunch here 3 days ago and ordered yellow curry. It was very good and pretty spicy which I really enjoyed. 

The curry was so good I went back tonight and ordered it again. What I got had to be the blandest yellow curry I have ever had. The curry really needed salt and it had no heat whatsoever. Very disappointing. 

I realize any resturant can have an off night so I will try them again in hopes of getting what I got days before.I've gotten use to this safeway after living down the street for a year but it certainly is different than others I've shopped at. 

Size wise it's tiny. There are only 5 or 6 registers and there's always a line, no matter what time of day. The later at night you go the sketchy the customers get.  I went in for a late night ice cream run once and thought I had entered the Twilight zone.

The one thing stopping me from giving it two stars are the employees.  They're always friendly and willing to help.  I can always start up a conversation when checking out.This place has the potential to be great!! However, it's not. The chips and salsa and atmosphere are definitely a reason to go! The best I've ever had!!!! The first trip there provided a waitress who never brought the cheese dip we ordered. When I asked her to take it off our check, she said, "ok".  Never an apology or "oh my gosh! I forgot!"  Nothing. She came by a couple of times to refill the empty water glasses them disappeared until the food and check were brought out. 

Giving them the benefit of the doubt, we went back the next day. Again, beautiful atmosphere from the patio. The chips and salsa were DELICIOUS!!!! The food and service were mediocre. I had the chicken sandwich which sounded somewhat healthy but came out greasy. 

So my advice: go!! Get the chips and salsa. Although I didn't have one, I hear the margaritas are good, too. Enjoy the patio and beautiful Phoenix weather. Just don't expect too much from the rest of the food or service.My family have been going to Matador since before my parents were born! LOL! it's the truth! It used be the smallest little hole in the wall and is now a great place to eat when downtown.

It can be a bee-yotch in a half to find a parking space on the street so I always head straight for the garage. When you enter the doors, it's a large place from another time.

And this is so because this place hasn't been redecorated since before I was born! I admit it's not the chicist place, but then again, pretentious places suck! But if you go, I insist on a booth near the window! It's a great feeling, so just sit and relax in the indirect light and munch on the free chips and salsa (which is BEST when the two salsas are mixed together with a light dash of salt! I prefer two parts mild to one part hot!)  cuz well... it might be a while before your server will come to take ur order!

The service isn't the greatest and I don't recommend going when in a rush. I particularlly like the combination dinner. You can any three out of several items with rice & beans. My fav is two beef tacos, cheese enchilada w/ rice & beans. :) Sometimes when i'm the mood for something different, I get the Greek Gyro platter! it's AMAZING!! I've only had gyros in two places, so i'm no inficianado, but it's still good!! 

I'd go in the late afternoon and early evening when it's not so busy. Avoid the lunchtime rush. Mix ur salsas and enjoy!!Free breakfast with lots of options- check
Nice outdoor pool- check
Comfy beds- check
Very friendly staff- check
Free wifi- check
Free parking- check (although a bit on the shady side, complete with a used condom in the parking spot next to us) 

Loud AC unit- super check
Smallest pool towels known to man- check

All in all, I would stay here again. I asked about the AC noise and the front desk said they would get right on it, so I doubt it's a constant issue. So sorry for Josh's waffle disaster, but my breakfast was pretty good. The hotel is very clean and easy to get to (even with the insane construction around).Great pulled pork sandwiches and it's a quick 5 min. drive from my house.  If you like BBQ this is one of the better places here in AZ.  I don't think their sides are really that good more just there to have something on the side other than the sandwich.  Anyways as I said great for a quick bite.I really liked this place. We came with a business group of around 20 for an early dinner and they got everything out correctly and promptly. The beans are great as is their eggplant. The beef skewers were ok, nothing too great but decent. Their noodle dishes are really good and I liked the quality of the food and found it to be very tasty. 

My only complaint was that I was really searching for spicy dishes and even the ones that they said were spicy really weren't. I put their house made hot sauce/oil on my dishes but it still didn't really add heat though it did add some good flavor.

I was a little overwhelmed by the menu and am looking forward to coming back and enjoying some more adventurous dishes when I am not with my co-workers who wanted to share everything and stuck to orange chicken, etc.Over the years I've been a buyer, window shopper, seller and borrower at many pawn shops. I even worked at one for day. Pawn shops are great places to borrow money or score a good deal. They are one of the most easily accessible forms of credit around and are available to anyone who with a legal ID.

Pawnshops vary greatly from shop to shop depending on local, city and state rules. They also vary based on how the owner decides to run them. In my experience there are 3 types of pawn shops; the retail store type, the crackhead-we'll-loan-money-to-anyone-that-comes-in-this-joint type and a hybrid of the two. There are variations as well with the our-guys-tote-guns type and the unarmed type and the we-hire-people-that-know-stuff type and the we-hire-people-that-know-nothing type.

This shop seems to be a hybrid as far as knowledgable employees goes and as far as being unarmed goes in what seems to be a more friendly retail environment. While none of the people here have been downright rude to me a couple have acted condescending at times despite having zero knowledge about an item. Conversely, there are a couple of super friendly employees here.

3 stars is "A-ok" and I won't argue with that for this place. They'll work with you, they'll cut deals, they'll make good loans, they'll negotiate prices for items for sale. I recommend dealing with the guy that smokes cigars whose name I believe is Dave. Knowledge and friendliness seem to be his strong-suit and he certainly understands the idea of long-term customer relations.

Not a big shop, but a clean shop and better than a lot of shops in town.Yeah not so bad Chinese food, big portions, family style.  The service, does not go out of their way but does their job very well.  
This would be a classic 3 and a half stars.  
I like plates that come out sizzling from the heat.  This is a nice place to have a larger group sit down and eat family style.

Look for their sign off 3rd st.i haven't been here since it was called Sonora, not much has changed. the food is pretty decent. i no longer drink alcohol so i got the rootbeer. it's pretty good. i actually like Stevia, and was happier knowing there was no sugar or HFCS

i actually like the fact a restaurant is trying to get away from HFCS. kudos.

i tried the Buffalo, i kinda thought it was a burger...but only because i wasn't really paying attention.  but it was tasty, 3 basted chicken strips on a roll with lettuce and tomato and nasty red onion...no...not saying their red onion was nasty..i just don't like red onion on sandwiches.. sorry. 

anyways..they added Sweet Potato fries to the menu and they were pretty good. they crinkle cut them..i think it adds more to the experience.Hotel has an odd set up with multiple wings.  Lobby and rooms are dated and need a refresh.  Parking is not adjacent to the hotel, but its free.  Central location close to downtown.  Not a bad experience, but would be better if facility was updated.So, I'll I had was the "Fried Calamari"  It was Good not the best I've had but not the worst either. The atmosphere was real nice. If you ever been to Oregano's you know it takes awhile to get your food even when you seat at the bar. I'll go again but not in any rushWe go back and forth with this place.  Sometimes good and sometimes bad.

Today we ordered the new pan pizza. It sounds good. When it arrived the pizza tasted like the box smelled. The new black box stinks. The pizza was not edible.

We called and they said that they would send another pizza.  

Not a fan of this new box.I've passed this place hundreds of times, and finally came here for dinner on a Saturday evening.  This place is an unapologetic dive with a unique charm.  They do have a fun "game room" with a pool table and other bar games.  The menu is fairly limited to burgers, fries, and other traditional bar fare.  They also only have two beers on tap, Bud and Bud Light.  

I ordered the 1/3 lb. wineburger and a side of fries.  The burger was tasty but nothing to rave about.  They served a generous portion of fries, which, like the burger, were good but not outstanding.  Surprisingly the service was excellent, which may be due to it being a slow night.  The server/bartender/cook was very attentive, asked about the burger, made sure I always had a drink, and even repositioned the TV so I can better watch a preseason game.  

Overall, it was a good experience (3.5 stars if Yelp allowed halves).  The food is good (between quality fast-food and a trendy restaurant), the prices are more than reasonable, and the service was great.  If I go back, I would definitely try the 2/3 lb. burgers, which looked like a better choice.The wonton soup was pretty good. The broth and veggies were tasty. The noodle part of the wontons were also good. The meat was a little off.

The pad thai was also decent. A tad spicy for our taste. It was also a little pricey. But, the portion was large!

I would probably give it a 3.5 if I could.Came here for lunch with a friend today. I had remember reading about the Asian nachos on Yelp and we ordered the small, without chicken. They were so YUMMY! Definitely something I would go back for. My friend and I were both pretty hungry and we polished off the small with no problem between the two of us. 

She ordered the Pad Thai Noodles and I opted for the California roll, with the real crab meat for the $1 up-charge. My friend said her dish was okay but she left a lot on her plate, though it was a huge portion. My Cali roll was pretty good, but kind of dry. I don't  think I've ever left a piece of sushi on my plate and I actually did this time around. I wasn't overly full either though so I think it just wasn't that great. It was a pretty large roll, 8 pieces, and each piece required two bites rather than the normal one piece, one bite. 

Service was pretty good. Our waitress kept our glasses full but disappear when we were waiting to pay. She also charged the wrong credit card for each of our tabs but corrected it, hopefully. 

Overall, I'd definitely go back for those nachos and to try something else on the menu.Had the meatiest, unbelievably stuffed beef burrito ever here. Cheap too, although it was kind of greasy. Still good though, A-OK!A bit pricey for what it is. A bit more smoke and mirrors than actual quality. It is not a bad place. Food is good, but there are much better places close by that are a bit better. 

If you need some pizza pretty quick and your and in the biltmore area, and you want a classy joing, then this is the place...

have funThis place is definitely not for the veggie burger lovers. The brand (whatever it is) that they chose tastes terrible! I plan to go back and try out other things, but I DO NOT recommend the veggie burger.

Otherwise, the onion rings were fantastico!! The perfect frying, with onions that melted rather than being chewy. 
I know it is always busy, but if you go during 2 to 3 its nice and calm.Step between Asian fast food and something a little nicer, and for that it's okay. The teriyaki sauce is too salty for my taste, but the caramel chicken and Thai dynamite chicken are both pretty good. The crab wontons always seem to be cold and not at all crispy by the time I get them, but the hot and sour soup has a good level of flavor. I tend to get takeout from here as opposed to eating in the restaurant, and it's always ready on time.I ordered the Margherita pizza. it was just ok I have never had one made like I have tasted in New York with fresh balls of mozzarella fresh bail and tomato's. I still will order but maybe ill try something different.Hostess rudely cut us off on the stairs. Waiter talked over us. Mentioned food allergy yet had food served that we are highly allergic to (but I fortunately noticed before it was consumed). Under par for what you pay for and would expect from the Hilton. On the bright side, the view was great. Bottom line, won't be back and won't recommend.I have never been in the actual store. I always get delivery.  It's strictly one of those "I'm too lazy to cook and don't want pizza" type of places.  As far as delivery goes, it's usually pretty quick. The lady you order from is pretty abrupt but always gets my orders right. The delivery people are always really nice.

As far as the food goes, it's not something I crave. I have had great hot and sour soup there!  Full of meat, tofu and spices!  There Kung Pao dishes are always hot and the meat is really good. I would not get the chow mein. It's really greasy and the broccoli tastes like kerosene!Sometimes I feel like I'm here more than I'm at home so it surprised me that I hadn't actually reviewed this place yet.  It's one of the bigger LA Fitness gyms I've been to so even when it's busiest I don't typically have to wait too long (if at all) for anything.  There's a huge cardio room when you first walk in and then the weight training is a separate area down a hallway.  Everything is kept pretty clean and if something is broken the staff is good about fixing it pretty quickly.  The staff at the front desk varies, sometimes they smile and are friendly, sometimes you get the teenagers who don't look up from their phones, but seriously do you really want the person checking you into the gym to make conversation with you?  Their job is to scan your keycard so you can go workout, so how bout you get to that and stop complaining.Having now visited the rest of the shop, I can say the meat is very reasonably priced. I go here to buy pork shoulder and pig fat for my sausages and it's always good value. Wide selection of different cuts and offal that main stream supermarkets don't stock.

Did I mention they sell Inca Cola? There are only two countries in the world that have a soft drink that out sells Coca Cola. One is Peru (Inca Kola) The other is Scotland (Irn Bru)Wagon Yard is older than dirt. It's been there since forever.... and it is the same now as it was back then. Wagon Yard is the least cowboy-est cowboy steakhouse in Phoenix that i know. It IS like going to Cave Creek before Cave Creek became the annex of North Scottsdale. Prices are cheap, portions are big and the atmosphere is completely unpretentious. I went the first time because i was WAAAAAAAY up on Bell (which was then the north edge of civilization) and most recently, because i had a coupon. It was well worth the stop.i feel bad leaving a goodwill anything less than a five, because really in my heart just the idea of goodwill deserves a five every time. im a thrifter, at least once a week i have to stop by one of these places just to see who's junk i can put in my house. but this goodwill in particular kind of made me sad. it was pretty dirty inside, (like youd think a goodwill would be, if youd never been to one)... there was a smell that i couldnt put my finger on, and i frankly wouldnt want to put anything on. there were broken things on the shelf, not like hey maybe this would be cool to take home and fix. im talking like broken things that should be in the trash. remember this is me the junk collector... i guess i just had higher expectations. ive probably been to a good 25-30 goodwill's since discovering how great they are. this one easily was the worst... im just sayin.we didn't buy our tires here, but they fixed the leak anyway. for free. and they're nice. i like that. with our other cars, discount has provided a great warranty and a decent price.  i regret buying tires for my civic somewhere else ... with them i got a bad warranty and bad service. discount really is a-ok by me.Fairly easy to navigate.  Shopping has quite a selection but expensive.  Damn they have a sales tax down there.  No buying for me then.  I hate that the car rental is 5 miles from the friggin airport.  It takes another 50 or so minutes to get a rental car after you land.  Joy..  The moving walk ways seldom work.  All in all not that great of an airport.One of the Biggest Air Port But they need more Restaurants in different terminal. we had a 2 hr layover we walked almost the whole airport just to find something we wanted . Besides that it clean at least the areas we walked .Not nearly as bad as Ohare Airport but not as good as Mesa Gateway.Getting ready to check out, but place lost a star due to unusual things. A flood on one end of the 3rd floor hallway knocked about about six rooms for awhile. They are still renovating those rooms over a month later - no cause of flood given. Also, a swarm of bees invaded the laundry room about two months ago and i found a few dead bees in the dryer lint tray before I started my cycle. Now, they also have their third different manager here in 8 months and although Shauna is very good at her job, all the staff is new and seems untrained. They cleared out Tammy and all the other regulars because ESA corporate decided to cut all their benefits and only offer three FT jobs per hotel So, it's another case of corporate greed and they spend tons of money of new signage and an average  breakfast, but they sacrifice quality employees, such a shame, but corporate will never read this review. Kirk is a nice guy and always was prompt on fixing stuff and every year there a crazy bunch of bikers that show up and literally take over the place. DO NOT come here during AZ Bike Week. Disgraceful that staff cannot control them, like who the F do they think they are? Just cause you ride a bike, you can stay out in the parking lot and drink all night. Now, that manager is gone, but very unprofessional. Also, for the last seven days, all the local channels always don't work and the satellite is always searching for them. Room for improvement, but not bad at all/I keep going to Paradise Bakery expected to be impressed or at least enjoy the food more than I do: I've had the chicken salad and paradise club. Both are eh. I'd rather go to Port of Subs or Jimmy Johns. The cookies are good but super sweet -- so much sugar. The soup is kind of gross -- I had the chicken and wild rice and had the texture of soupy jello.

I'll go here if i have to but it's certainly not my first choice. Maybe I just need to find something I like here.After a movie at AMC, my mom, dad, aunt & I decided to have an early dinner here. I have been here a few times in the past but it's been a good 3-4 years since my last visit. I forgot that they have paper on the table so you can doodle on it. That's always fun. Our server was Dan & he was really friendly.

For starters we ordered the calamari, by we I mean my mom because she orders calamari whenever we go out. It was good & so was the dipping sauce. Their rosemary bread is tasty too, especially with a lil olive oil. My dad ordered red wine (not sure which 1) & I ordered the ultimate leaning bellini. Dad enjoyed his wine, had 3 glasses & I loved my cocktail, so yummy! For our entrees: my aunt-shrimp portifino, dad-aged beef tenderloin spiedini, mom-originally wanted lasagna but they were out for the next hour, ugh, so she settled for chicken scaloppine & myself-lobster ravioli. My aunt loved hers, dad liked his, mom didn't care for hers & kept eating off of our plates & I liked mine as well. 

Not sure how authentic their Italian is, but hey we overall enjoyed our dinner & would definitely return!What... Is this place 15 bucks to get into these days? Great place to see a movie, but I have been there a few times when the feature was sold out an hour before showtime. Buy the "Souvenir Cup" and get refills for only a dollar! I like the popcorn sprinkles too.This place is near where my kid swims, so we wanted to try this. My 8 year old ordered the turkey sandwich which was perfect. So healthy and yummy for a child. I had the country friend steak which wasn't anything special but I was craving it. 

Problems I had were all service. It took FOREVER to even get the lady to show up to take drink orders. When she did, it took her FOREVER to come back to the table. I asked for their beer selection and she said they only have Miller or Bud or something like that. I opted for ice tea that was never refilled. Ugh. I'd try again (no, it wasn't packed) to see if it's better next time.Okay...I'm not a big buffet fan, but the Old Country Buffet is da bomb. It's really affordable too. Me, hubby and the step kiddies can eat here for around $35. 

The food is actually really good, way way better than Golden Corral. The kids love it because of the drink bar. You can refill on any type of drink you want, from sweet tea to blueberry icees. 

Hubby and I love it because you can get quality cooked food, which is surprising for a buffet including, salmon, cheesecake, fried fish and more.Lots of upselling. Quick oil change though.Good Food , new addition being built should really be nice when done, Then they will have a bar and patio, Hope the margaritas are good might become a regular.I was introduced to this place by one of my co-workers. She is pretty much a regular here and insisted that I try this place. This place is small, mostly quiet every now and then. There is a tv and music playing in the background. I suddenly thought about other restaurants that might play music and I'm just now realizing the fact that I don't listen. huh! I know of one other place that does. Okay, back to the subject at hand.

The lunch specials a really reasonable under $10 with drink. The sweet and sour pork, chicken are good. The chow mein, watery. The egg drop soup not the best texture. (I think soup has texture) The egg roll is good. The steamed and fried rice not the taste I'm used too. It's like dry and almost but not quite done. Maybe it's the type they use. The service is quick, they refill your drink before you are half way. That's annoying (too me). Overall, I think its a nice place to go.This place used to be very good. They are missing a lot of products and their meat and veggies aren't as fresh as before. Sometimes you would get this food one week and the next they don't have it anymore. I hate there is no consistency to their products. It's either a hit or miss sometimes.We tried the 13 course tasting menu with extended wine selection. The service was wonderful and 100% spot on.

The food however, was quite a let down. Some dishes really excelled in their taste and presentation, while many were just a puzzling question mark followed by a mediocre taste. 

A few memories include a shot of squeezed juice which is considered a course which is more suited as a canape. 

A salad which included a few leafs of lettuce with two small slivers of cheese. I appreciated the craftsmanship of the 30 year old cheese, but it in no way complimented the lettuce and left you wondering why it wasn't paired with something more suitable or to paraphrase, enjoyable.

Out of the 13 courses, there were 3 or 4 that really shined.. the buffalo being one of these. 

When you average in the odd interior decor it's apparent that attention has not been paid to all the details.. and that's what a fine dining experience really should include. If you're aiming for multi-michelin star experience, detail detail detail. 

On another high note, the wine pairings were absolutely wonderful and the sommelier was both informative and wonderful in not only introducing each pairing, but being able to provide excellent alternatives when pairings didn't go quite well.

The card which gave us a list of all the courses + pairings was a nice touch at the end.

For Arizona this is a step up in experience and i'm happy to see restaurants of such caliber really offering alternatives to places such as Binkley's.

It's worth trying, but for us there weren't many dishes we'd be craving on a return visit for. 

After reading other reviews, it may be an issue that Kai has invested a good amount of time in perfecting the smaller tasting menus and main entrees but struggled to fill the larger 13 plate experience.Typical chain "southwestern/Tex Mex" food in a corporatey atmosphere. They have some tasty dishes and a killer sunday brunch, but everything on the menu is kind of ambiguous.

Prices here are about on par with most places of this type (I put it in the Applebee's, TGI Friday's, Charleston's, etc.) category. 

I enjoyed my visit to this location better than my visits to the PV and Tempe locations.I am giving it 3 stars as the food was just okay.  There was no fabulous tastes from the prime rib dinners that me or my daughter who has a bit of a culinary background (homeade cooking that is).  The reason for an actual 3-stars, is that it is a beautiful restaurant, very comfortable dining, services are wonderful, but the food just did not satisfy paying just over $100.00.  Sorry, I have had much more flavorful prime rib at Black Angus.  Save your money folks, maybe we will have to venture over to Flemings, Ruth Chris or another steakhouse for a delicious and flavorful prime rib dinner.I have issues with bar's in strip centers.  But this one wasn't half bad.  Went for a AZ Derby Dames event then went to see the Phunk Junkeez.  It's a laid back kinda place that I usually take a liking to.I've frequented this location a couple times & I've never had an issue with them, service or food wise. I just enjoyed a peanut buster parfait & it was just like the picture, how many restaurants can say that!, lol  when I'm in the mood for DQ & I'm in the area I'll stop in here for a biteI have to say my experience there was just "eh."  I was craving breakfast food and was looking forward to trying this place out.  It looks super cute from the outside and there is ALWAYS a huge line/wait outside so I thought for sure it would be good.  I ordered blueberry pancakes and a side of eggs.  I'm not a huge breakfast fanatic but I would think pancakes would be hard to mess up.  They were really dense and not light and fluffy, I could hardly eat them.  The other people I was with enjoyed their food and we actually did really love the yummy cinnamon roll we all shared (it's what they're "famous" for).  The server forgot to bring out one of the side items we ordered, so we never even got that part of our order but then it showed up on our bill.  I would probably not go back to this place, next time I'm trying Liberty Market which is literally right next door.I have gone to many gyms. This is one is good but far from perfect.

If I move homes I may not join Mtn again since they have no racquetball courts and charge the same as the LA Fitness's that do.


The Good...

Staff is very nice.

The place is small, which I like.

1/4 mile from my house which is why I joined.
- I was going to LA Fitness which was nicer, larger, and less expensive AND had racquetball courts which I used all the time.


The Average...

The snack/juice bar - it is just plain. They have nothing that makes anyone want to buy something there. They need to get creative, have daily or weekly specials... do something creative. I've never purchased anything from there and don't see myself wanting anything they have... and from what I've seen, most people seem to share my opinion since I rarely see anyone buying anything.


The Not So Good...

Broken equipment was taking months & months to get fixed. I reported items 5,6,10 times and it took 5 months in many cases. They all finally got fixed but many things were broken at the same time. 
- I think there is a better maintenance guy there now.

They constantly have someone or business hocking something in the very small lobby/entry... this place is small so it is often in the way. It is not a huge deal but it gets old. Have them setup on the sidewalk or something out of the way... not in the main walkways where everyone must go around these vendors.

No racquetball courts
- having 2 courts would not kill you. Honestly this is probably the single largest reason I would not likely sign up if I lived close to LA Fitness or another gym that had courts.No wireless ? You've got to be kidding.  Thank goodness for a hotspot connection from my HTC G2.  I also didn't enjoy the mandatory msg from the hotel phone, insistently beeping until we listened to a long rambling message about checkout procedures.  I have fond memories of this place from the early 90s, and it hasn't changed much, which is both good and bad. The staff as always is consistently nice and very helpful.  A low-scale renovation is rolling across this hotel, so I hope it updates what has become a Scottsdale institution.Very nice location with excellent service.
Pros: Customer service, beautiful interior and exterior, comfortable and well designed rooms, excellent food, good prices and awesome valet. 
Cons: If you're a light sleeper like I am, you'll wake up a lot. 
Ceiling creeks at night, guests can be heard through the walls and people start getting up at 5:30 am. We stayed on the second floor, so maybe that's isolated for the creaking ceiling. 
I'd stay here again because of the service.Straight outta NY.  Get decent deli and all the attitude you would expect.  They use Boar's Head meat which is top quality, but the bread is in need of a change.  Hot pastrami is especially good if available as a daily special.Good flavors, fast service.  Love their green curry.  Great happy hour where appetizers are 1/2 off the reg price.  The downside is that most of the appetizers are deep fried.  I like lunch better than dinner as they offer a nice salad with the meal.I'll tell you what - wandering around this place looking at clothes gave me the feeling that none of this junk was ever sold at Nordstroms. It all looked like rejected lines of clothing. I'm thinking the Rack is to Nordstroms what Old Navy is to the Gap... if I've got that right. I just think it's another branding where they can sell less-attractive or fashionable clothes for seemingly less money. 

Although, if I were to get a suit - I'd certainly give this place a go because suits are all the same and they have pretty decent prices on nice suits. Dress shirts as well - which also are all the same as far as I'm concerned. For hipper clothes, I don't think this place has much going for it. They have all the name brands you would expect to find, but the lines they carry aren't hip and recent memory tells me most of that stuff hasn't been hip. 

You can certainly find better bargains at thrift stores and second hand shops and the clothes are about as stylish. Also, having been to Off 5th Avenue at Arizona Mills, I can say that that place has a much more contemporary and 'hip' selection of clothes and at a better price I think. 

This is just my opinion as a guy - women might have a different experience.Arena gets the job done when you need some bar food and a drink. It's certainly nothing fancy. It's split into 2 parts. It's just a very large room with somewhat of a warehouse feel. The main section has a bunch of low tables, a few high tops, and a bar to the left side. I'm not sure what it is about the layout of this place that confuses me. Picture a school cafeteria. Lots of tables set up in rows. Good for groups because pushing them together is a cinch considering you are basically in the lap of the table next to you anyhow. If you need to get up to use the restroom, it feels like you end up rubbing your ass on the head of the person behind you trying to squeeze by. The side area has some booths and more cramped seating and seems more "family appropriate". 
They do show music videos, which is pretty awesome considering some of the tunes people choose. Some real old school gems are thrown in that provide some entertainment. They also have darts and a Big Buck Hunter. TVs are scattered about. 
The menu is big and diverse. Typical bar food (wings, burgers, sandwiches, salads) even pasta as well as Mexican food. Something for everyone! Service is friendly and fast. I usually have Lori, who is terrific. 
I would up the rating if it wasn't such an odd seating arrangement. I'm not in middle school anymore and prefer to keep those days behind me. 
*Happy hour has some good drink specials. 
*The water tastes like dirt from a pond, so spring for a bottle if you are in the need for some re-hydration. 
*There is no patio or outside seating here.Don't get me wrong, this place is tasty, but goodness sakes, did I seriously just pay that much for a hot dog that tastes like the $1.50 ones at Costco down the way?Taco Bell, is well Taco Bell.

We have been coming here a few times each month whenever we go grocery shopping at nearby Fry's.  It's a cleans store with some very nice employees who rarely get the order wrong.  We also usually see and have gotten to know the franchise owner, he's always about checking on things.

But not a lot has changed since Glenn Bell first made that chicken wire contraption to invent the hard shell taco over sixty years ago.  Recently though, corporate owner Yum Brands has taken to upgrade the menu with offering from Chef Lorena Garcia's authentic Latin recipe premium items called Cantina Bell.  They have also rolled out this past summer a tie-in from Frito-Lays for a Doritos hard shell taco.  Both items are good and tasty.  

I have a unwritten rule that most fast food places can only aspire to Three Stars, or in Yelp-ese "A-OK" ratting.  Given the uniformity of fast food, it's hard to set them apart from another fast food place.  But, I like this franchise owner for his hustle and how he keeps on top of things and actually manages his chain of stores.  So Three and a Half Stars to him and this location!I have been to this restaurant many times with friends, family, clients, dates and EVERY time the food and service was SUPER!  Never tasted a bad dish and loved the service.   EXCEPT for list last week.  Took my daughter for her birthday and it was my least favorite.  The Bruchetta was dry and the waiter called me a liar about my response to having a dish before stating "we just added that 3 weeks ago"  I don't know I just never got the right vibe from him and our service took over 2 hours and we didn't have a good time with our waiter.  Before this trip a 5 would be my rating but with this last trip the "honeymoon" feels over.The Ice Den is great and well thought out. They have a café, a bar and 3 hockey rinks. It looks clean and seems very well run. So far everything is nice, but let me share my experience more in detail.

Once out on the ice I felt like Bambi, since it had been a dozen years or so since I ice skated last. My biggest obstacle was these pegs in the front of the skate, that doesn't exist on hockey skates and hockey skates is all I have ever skated on in my past - but since these were rented and they all were the same, there was nothing to it but embrace this new and most unfamiliar experience. There is a few personnel skating to keep order and help out amongst the hoard of children and inexperienced skaters alike in this desert ice rink. Especially one man in his forties, seem to have an avid napoleon complex and acts with a self-infused authority and speaks down to children and adults alike. The following conversation takes place when he skates up to me after I have fallen on the ice.

Skate Nazi: -"You need to tie your skates tighter. That's why you fell."
Me: -"No, I was caught by surprise when these pegs caught the ice. I am not used to skate on these girl skates, see wher.."
Skate Nazi: -"FIGURE skates" *Obviously insulted*
Me: -"Yeaah!' *Obviously amused, by the fact that I stepped on this clowns emotional toes*

It wasn't what he said, it was the tone of the importance out of which he feels in charge and in control. I so wanted to be kicked out of this establishment, but I wasn't. All personnel here is very nice, and I like the bar. I admit that after 20 minutes my feet was in pain, and I no longer
enjoyed the act of skating.

The reason it doesn't get a 5 star, is NOT the Skate Nazi but the fact that there is way too many people (and by people I do mean kids) on the rink and the same time. It is chaos, but then again maybe that's just a sign that I should sit on my front porch in my rocking chair and not be ice skating.Quick drive thru if you are on a lunch break, nice staff.  Went at an off time for a small fry and small frosty since I was hungry and needed a snack (~2 p.m.).  Fries were hot and tasted fresh and the frosty was delicious as always.

Parking lot is poorly designed, so it can back up into the main road, which blocks traffic flow and irritates other drivers.  It can also block you into a parking spot in their already rather small private parking lot and you will need to wait for a kind driver to not move forward in the line for you to be able to back out.  I would recommend parking in the lot close by and walking over to avoid this dilemma!Better than average fresh-Mex food.

I like their chips and salsa bar, but none of their salsas are phenomenal, just mediocre.  Their food is kinda bland and lacks flavor and their plates are a little on the small side..... not enough beans / rice.  Their prices are decent.  If you're thinking Chipotle or Rubio's or some crap like that, you'd be better off here, but that's not saying much.While I love Harkins theaters this one hasn't been updated as much as others have.  It's a great theater to see art house films.  Staff here is awesome!I have been coming to this restaurant for quite some time and was here on Tuesday of this week. This may very well be my last time eating here. We were seated at a table on the patio and it was, well, quite frankly, filthy. The patio was filthy. It was littered with crumpled up used napkins, straw holders, you name it. The oilcloth tablecloth on our table was so sticky I had to spread a napkin on the table in front of me so that my glass and silverware didn't stick to the tablecloth. Our server, at our request, wiped the table off but it didn't help. As always, the food was good and our server was friendly, but it and, even the view of the fountain, didn't make up for the appalling conditions. They need to buy new tablecloths for all of the outdoor tables and they need to power wash their patio. There is simply no excuse for these conditions. So, Euro Pizza Cafe, it's up to you. BTW, I don't live in Fountain Hills but I have friends who do, and I have spread the word about conditions at this restaurant.Various options depending on what you're shopping for. They now have these ANNOYING motorized stuffed animals that kids sit on and drive through the mall. Wouldn't be a big deal except they're weaving through the crowd. Watch your surroundings!OK so this place lost stars for a couple of reasons.

First off, both my husband and I ordered the same thing, Fish and Chips. My husband's fish was great, however mine was slightly burnt and just down right gross. This is because they fried my fish with old grease which made it dark brown and burnt. The coleslaw is really watery which makes it difficult to eat. We also ordered an appetizer, the bucket of shrimp which was awesome and the seasoning was to die for. Judy the server was superb and we were even greeted by the manager and served by him personally. When I informed them about my food they gave me two gift cards for free appetizers for my next visit which was great. The service was 5 stars but I had to deduct 2 points for inconsistency of meal quality. I would come back but only if they get their cooks to use fresher ingredients.The problem is I was annoyed before I even walked through the door.  It's not the closest Sprint store to me, but I had to drive out of my way to go to this one because it's the closest that has technicians on site.  It's not far, but I passed at least two other Sprint stores between my work and home to get to it.   And in the end, I really drove to it for nothing.

Some features on my LG Optimus S just decided to stop working this morning.  Hoping that the issue would just be a button I didn't know where to locate, I went to the store for help.  After checking in, and waiting a few minutes, some one took my phone, listened to my problem, asked for permission to hard boot it if they had to, and told me it would be 90 minutes.  Since there's only so many ways to entertain yourself without your phone or reading materials, I left to run some other errands.  When I got my phone back, it turns out that hard booting the phone is exactly what they did.  Yes, I gave them permission to do it.  But I could've done that myself, and it would've taken a lot less than 90 minutes. They were nice enough to save my contacts and photos and reinstall them, but again, that's something I could've done myself.

All the employees are pleasant to deal with, but the store itself is a cluster.  While the check-in process is a nice touch to guarantee first come first serve, there's too many people waiting around to be helped.  The wait time was not atrocious, but If Sprint is going to force people to drive out of their way to get to this specific store, it should be staffed a lot better.I have some friends who are madly in love with the Siamese Cat, but I just don't get it.  There is certainly nothing wrong with it, but my meals there have been less than passion-inducing.  

The problem may lie in their vegetarian options which is what I eat, but not my friends.  Maybe the meat is really good?

Last night we had this amazing (vegetarian) soup, but my meal part was just OK.  I don't think they really get tofu, it looked like it had been cut and steamed like a carrot.  

I am certain I will be going back, I am still holding out for being blown away by this place!Want pizza and wings but tired of Domino's, Pizza hut, and Papa John's, but still want the average taste of average pizza? Give this place a shot.

Wings are great. Pizza's nice, too. Nothing fancy, but they do have this extra large pizza that is so big I had to put it in the trunk of my sedan, so there's that, if you like a bit of novelty. All in all, an average pizza place. The staff is either helpful and friendly or eternally cursed to never feel happiness again. I think you get a 50/50 chance of either.

I'd recommend this place for take out more than dining in.3 1/2

I like the Buck Hunt, super-sized hard core mixed drinks, friendly bartenders, cheapness, backyard for smokers, and with a big group of people you can pretty much take over this place. Also-snackies! 

Not so sure I like the over-the-top (OTT) shady characters here-one guy was quite enamoured of me-and there were some others that I cannot even bear to type out or it will make them real and not a figment of my late night drunk imagination. Also, those drinks made a friend smack me-in a good way, but DAMN-that shit never happened at Caseys.

Not sure how to describe the inside, but I wouldnt want one of those black light DNA sabers in here....uh uh, NO WAY.We ordered the tasting menu, which coupled each course with a different wine.  The food was well prepared and presented.  The wine was fine but, sadly, the restaurant was a tad stingy with the pour.  The glasses emptied too quickly.

There was another serving faux pas.  Plates were cleared before everyone was finished a course.  At an Applebee's, I can forgive that.  At restaurant with pretensions of class, it isn't done.  For the slow eaters, it creates a sense of hurry.  It undercuts the atmosphere that a good restaurant would try to create.Uninteresting. Not any different from Danny's or IHOP or similar. Tasted alright, was warm, relatively fast service. I do not know, what else would be there? I kind of was expecting something better then Danny's but was not really disappointed when it was not. It's alright, just do not expect anything special.

"Its alright"

EugeneI love that this is a locally owned neighborhood place and the restaurant is very clean. The free focaccia bread was very good and it was a nice touch to have the Parmesan cheese on the table. Service was prompt. The wine list is small and I did notice some tables drinking sangria but we didn't try the sangria (only $6 per glass). It was family friendly with a good 10 and under child's menu with something more than chicken fingers. I had a special, penne giardino and it was flavorless!  We've done take out before and it was fine but don't go expecting amazing Italian.Its a Staples all right...Im sorry, I cant really say too much about the bar. It was, well, a bar. 

I felt the need to review the epic performance that took place this evening. Nathan put on a truly stunning karaoke display. His opening number was good if not great, Twist and Shout... complete with the Ferris Beuler treatment. It was clear at this point that Nathan had the show after the first set. After some discussion and careful planning it was set... Nathan was going to bust out the Big Dawg for the second set. Now this is the point in the show that an artist has to let everything hang out... To take chances and hope for the best. Its on... 

Trey Anastasio of Phish once said in an interview that there were 2 artists that he has seen that always had the audience completely locked in and focused on what was going on, on stage. These 2 artists were Frank Zappa and Jerry Garcia. Trey has obviously never seen Nathan Simpson perform Lets Get it On. Some like to call this the human magnet others just like to call this EPIC! After a miscue on the opening line, Nathan rebounded nicely and served up a gem. By mid Getting On, a stage that was occupied by Nathan was now occupied by 4 other people, 3 of which being female and one of which being fucking hot. By the time the last notes were played we all just sat in awe... Thanks Nathan.Well, the place was clean enough and the price was alright. They have good lunch combos and their egg rolls are better-than-average. Had a Sweet/Sour chicken lunch combo, came with a little fried rice, one egg roll, and two fried wontons (whole)

However, their fried rice has almost nothing in it, just a little egg and it is a little brown but I don't think it has really been fried. There are no vegetables in the fried rice like you see at most other places, so -1 star.

Another -1 star because of their soy sauce. This is my biggest gripe about Asian take-out; they use the fake 'Panda' brand soy sauce that is artificially flavored and tastes like plastic. At least if you dine-in you can get the naturally-brewed Kikkoman soy sauce. If you get take out, ask for an empty sauce container and a lid for it so you can pour some real soy sauce out of the bottle before you leave. This wouldn't bother me so much if it weren't that if I can taste the difference, I KNOW they can.This is a nice, clean, and small place.  The service is prompt and friendly.  The food is good.  Ive come here more than a couple of times.  

The only reason I gave this place a 3 star review and not a 4 or 5 is because Ive been getting sick.  Ive noticed that the last 2 times I got sick I had Abacus Inn prior to getting sick.  It doesn't happen every time  but I think I've narrowed it down to the egg rolls.  Every time I get the egg rolls I get sick. 

I will be returning.  The food is good.  I will just try and stay away from the egg rolls.I had wanted to come here for a while because I had heard how great the pies were but it was so far away from everywhere I normally travel that I didn't know when that would actually happen.  Then my parents came down from Oregon and wanted to go visit the Grand Canyon so we were able to stop here on the way back.

I was only planning on going for the pie but we decided to get dinner as well.  We got fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy, chicken and biscuits and the chicken ceasar wrap.  If I could only use one word to describe everything it would probably be "meh".  It wasn't bad but it wasn't very good either.  I kind of rushed through eating in hopes that the pie would make it all worth it.

The waitress came back and we asked her which pies were the best.  She said the apple crumb, the blueberry and the tennessee lemon.  We decied to take her advice on two of them, ordering the apple crumb and the blueberry and for the third choice we got the banana cream.  The apple had a pretty good flavor but it wasn't mind blowing like I was expecting.  The blueberry could have been a little bit sweeter.  The banana cream I actually liked quite a bit but again, I was expecting to have the best pie of my life and that just didn't happen.  It's not a place that I will be going out of my way to return to.My best friend and some our assorted kidlets ate here last night on our way back down from Flagstaff, where we were picking up the two oldest kidlets from NAU.

We pulled in at 8:40 and it looked almost deserted, there were only about 2 cars in the parking lot...  Being afraid they'd already closed, I checked the hours on the door; it said it was open to 10PM, perfect.  We walk in, seat ourselves (per the sign).  The wooden highchair we found for my toddler was missing the safety belts and was more wobbly than a 50 year old Bangladesh high-rise in a category 4 typhoon.  Seriously, I wasn't even sure it was totally safe, but we didn't see another option so I kept her at arm's length just in case it started to lean dangerously as she wiggled in it.  Thankfully it held up okay, but it doesn't have too many more days ahead of it before it's fire kindling...  

Right away a hostess came over and offered us menus and takes our drink orders: 4 waters and a Dr. Pepper.  The waitress was there just a couple minutes later to get our dinner orders and unfortunately, one of the teenagers had just wandered away 30 seconds beforehand, so we had to ask her to come back in a second to get all of our orders.  Well, nearly 10 minutes later she returned and got all of our orders.   Also, while she was gone I noted that the floor was filthy.  Really, I'm cool with rustic concrete floors, but throughout the day someone needs to be sweeping the floor.  This floor didn't look like it had been swept ALL day long with crumpled napkins, bits of smashed food, straw wrappers, crumbs, etc.  

I ordered the mac and cheese dinner entree, with vegetables in lieu of potato side and a side salad.  My side salad was served right away and was crisp and fresh.  Very tasty.  Interestingly, they serve it with diced cucumber and tomatoes, which was different, but very tasty.  I think I liked it better that way compared to how most places serve it.

The mac and cheese arrived a few minutes later and while it looked delicious with a perfectly browned bread crumb topping and gooey, stringy cheesey deliciousness, and perfect al dente macaroni noodles, it was totally and utterly tasteless.  I honestly think the kitchen made it without any seasoning at all.  Now, I'm no gourmand, but I've made some home style mac and cheese in my day and there are certain things (aside from salt and pepper) you can add to give it some zing, like onion, garlic, nutmeg, mustard powder, paprika, etc..  I don't think this mac and cheese even saw salt and pepper, let alone ANY of the more complex seasonings.  Sad.  I was really enticed, because it looked so good on the surface, but it was a utter taste-flop.  My 17 month old daughter wouldn't even eat it.  Additionally, the side dish they served it with was canned peas with a couple of random pieces of carrots.  Yuck.   Note to the kitchen: canned peas are virtually inedible gray-green little balls of mush; please at least use frozen peas, they are so much better tasting and looking and practically the same price.

My best friend said her Cobb Salad with grilled chicken was the best she ever had, and she knows from salads.

The other kids ate their food without complaint, except my 15 year old nephew, who also received a side of canned peas with his dinner.  He refused to touch them and made jokes threatening to throw them, one by one, at his older sister.  Ah, the joys of older children...  ;)


Anyway, my friend and I shared a piece of Jack Daniels Pecan Pie.  That was superb.  And really, as most of us already know, pie is what Rock Springs Cafe is known for throughout the State, right??

Our bill for 5 1/2 (2 adults, 3 teens and a baby) was about $66.  We paid it, and sadly we literally weren't quite to our car in the parking lot when they turned off the lights and closed the place down.  Weird.  It wasn't even 9:20 yet.Had the fried chicken salad. Wish they would add a grilled chicken salad. Trying to make good choices with my dining, and fried chicken strips on a salad is counter productive. Waitress/bartender was on the spot.

If you go between 4 - 6 don't sit facing the window, the Sun blinds you like a Gamma Ray. I asked the bartender if she could shut the blind as the sun was reflecting off a wind shield and boring a hole in my face, I pointed at the window.  She proceeded to shut all blinds but the one that had the super nova coming through.Oh how I miss my 5& Diner on Ray & I-10.. that was my home away from home for breakfast.  

We decided to try this location and while it looks just like the one on Ray, it's nothing like it.  Sure the insides are the same; they even have some of the same looking staff. The food is even good, but it didnt have that same feel I was used to.

Forgot the waitress' name, but when I looked at the menu, I noticed my favorite thing was missing.. the breakfast skillets. :(    They said that all locations were privately owned (Iknew that) and they didnt have those.  

I ordered the french toast combo and it was ok...  Nothing like the location on Ray.  They used different styles of french toast and made it an art form.  

Will I go back here? Sure.. but it wont be my first choice...Pretty good pizza.  This place isn't far from my house, so I'll probably go back.  Not as good as my beloved Grimaldi's, but it's plenty good for the price.We enjoyed our stat at Sunset Station Hotel. Although we aren't gamblers, the area met our needs as Hoover Dam is close by.

As far as this hotel, there was so much we didn't understand, and no one explained how things worked. We self-parked only to find out it's difficult to carry a lot of your travel gear into the hotel.  And, we got a free players club card and at first glance I said no thanks. Turns out, it would have had money on it (From $3 to $500).

The food wasn't that great, but as always, we pack our own breakfast and lunch.

On the plus side, the room was great---this is a non-smoking room that is truly non-smoking! comfortable and very, very clean. We got a great deal on groupon and opted to upgrade for a Junior suite.Breakfast here is ok. Of course, you have to order the pancakes (blueberry!). My sister ordered the blueberry pancakes, which had whipped cream and blueberry preserves/canned blueberry filling on top. I ordered a spinach and cheddar omelette, which was satisfactory. In all honesty, I believe that this food tastes just like the stuff you make at home. The buttermilk pancakes were pretty good, since they were soft and warm. I may consider eating here again, but I would prefer eating somewhere like Pancake House or Hash House A Go Go!This is my first time trying Olive Garden and I was very disappointed by the service. The server that catered to us was just horrible (Not to mention any names). He came to our table at least 3x the whole dinner and took about 7 minutes to retake our order because we wanted something else. I am very generously giving them 3 stars as the food was really good. I ordered the Tour of Italy and the portion was plentiful. I couldn't even finish my  order and had to bring it home. But at least he sort of made up for by giving us a whole bag of that awesome breadsticks! I will for sure be going to Olive Garden again, but just not this one.Today's review is for a place I've visited many times before: Olive Garden on Sunset Rd. The restaurant was busy but I did not have to wait long for a table. Fortunately I missed the usual lunchtime rush.

The hostess, Danielle(?), after making me wait for what seemed too long while she finished tapping away at her computer display, merely looked up at me and waited for me to say something. Perhaps she was tired due to the hour? I requested a table and was seated at a booth in one of the dark and cozy rooms. The restaurant areas I visited seemed clean but the decor is dated; the table was set with four rolled-up sets of eating utensils & napkins as well as the previous guest's check and payment.

After a few minutes, my server, Kalecia, came by to get my drink and lunch order. She was efficient, nice and a bit "matter-of-fact" (perhaps she was tired too). I had Soup, Salad and Breadsticks -- my usual business-day lunch. I've always liked the salad at OG (something about the dressing and the way the fresh ingredients are prepared and presented) and today was no exception. The Chicken Gnocchi soup is usually good (though there are too few gnocchi and chicken morsels to really make it exceptional). The breadsticks had just the right amount of garlic seasoning today (sometimes they're just too bland) and were served warm. With a slightly watered-down soft drink, tax and tip the tab was just under $14.

I'm not looking for a five-star experience when I go to OG -- it's more a desire for some comfort food served in comfortable surroundings by friendly staff. I may be old-fashioned but I expect the hostess to greet a customer with "Hello! Welcome to Olive Garden! How many in your party?" or something like that. Other than that one minor issue, I had no complaints and I'll visit them again. I've read that OG is trying to freshen its image as well as the decor of its restaurants. This restaurant is definitely showing its age but I can't complain; so am I.

-- 3.2 comfortable starsThis is a good place to go if you're simply into gaming.  If you're looking for a wild night, this is not the place.  Although, they do have bands play on certain "bike nights" that are once in a blue moon.  Good food, quiet place, and bathrooms are very clean.  They also have great drawings.For lunch my wife ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup and I requested my first ever matzo ball soup.  Same soup, but my matzo ball acted like a sponge without any noticeable benefit.We took advantage of a weluvlocals coupon and I was really looking forward to this but turned out to be somewhat of a so-so event.

The wait was 15 minutes longer than we were told which was unusual since they had empty tables.  When we sat I was pretty hungry enticed by the rolling menu reader board outside the restaurant.  Looking around at some still empty tables we decided to start out with an appetizer and chose the Caprese Croutons.

Side note: Our server was friendly but border line annoying.  The rest of the folks we encountered were nice and friendly, helpful.  But our server, was somewhat patronizing.  "Oh well, glad she is not siting down to eat with us" I thought.  

We ordered Seafood Linguini, the Grilled Chicken and Broccoli, and the Chicken Cannelloni.  While we waited we feasted on some pretty good breadsticks and the crouton appetizers.  My hopes somewhat dimminshed by the wait and the server began to rise again.  There were still a number of empty tables and we wondered why do they keep everyone waiting?

Aside from the wait to get in, our food arrived fairly promptly, nice and hot.  Looking apetizing we began to sample.  My cannelloni was a mass of cheese, more than I thought since the menu said topped by a garlic cream sauce.  It tasted good but I expected quite a bit more spinach on the inside.  What I found was, well, more cheese and a few flecks of spinach.  

While we continued I looked at Mikes plate and said "did they forget the sauce?" and he said "there is some here, somewhere."  Clearly not enough for us sauce lovers though.  The linguini was the same story.  Lot's of noodles, a little bit of sauce, and a sprinkling of seafood.  There were two sugar cube sized pieces of salmon, three rings of calamari, a few mussels and clams and three medium-small shrimp.  Not a seafood lovers plate but it tasted OK, just not enough sauce, again.

When we were finishing up we asked to see a desert menu.  Our server said "I'll be with you in a moment".  We waited fifteen minutes to get the menu, in the meantime our leftovers were boxed by some helpful drink servers and we were ready to go.  We saw our server busying about a few times but never looked our way.  Finally we flagged her down and she said "ready for your check?"

We decided to skip desert.

Overall the food was fair.  I almost gave this place a two star but with the coupon, the overall friendly service, ample breadsticks I decided to cut some slack.  I wanted so much to fall in love with this place but I think there are better Italian places to eat.

Oh, and there were empty tables the entire time we were there, while people stood and waited to be seated.They did a solid job.  Told me the price before performing any service.  Reset the maintenance notification properly.  I needed a special synthetic which cost more.  They didn't try and sell me anything, probably because it is a newer vehicle.Showed-up for a t-time of 8am. Paired me with another group of people. Round finished in about 4.20. The course overall is pretty typical of neighborhood courses. The driving range is nice, short game area as well, the putting green area is spot on. We played from the whites since there new golfers in our group and pace of play would be quicker. There were lots of bunkers and some holes had some water but overall nicely designed course. I would play this course again.My first time trying Bun Bo Hue ever! Parking was easy, they have their own lot that is shared by other restaurants. The restaurant is very big and we were seated quickly. Service was a bit slow compared to the many employees that night. I felt like most of them tried really hard to avoid eye contact with their customers...I didn't like the Bun Bo Hue because it tasted kind of weird. Sort of like pho, but spicy... Their portions weren't big either. My bf and my dad had to order an additional rice plate to share and usually they don't need to when it comes to pho. Maybe it was a hit or miss. It was kind of pricey too. Perhaps, we should try another place for pho when we're in town.Bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle) was delicious and so was the appetizer canh ga chien nuoc mam (fried chicken wings with fish sauce) - it tastes better than it sounds lol

The service was horrible though...Although I know that there are Mexican establishments across the city that serve better fare, I have a special place for Tacos Mexicos strictly because of its' connection to my hometown...Friday nights in high school always ended up at Tacos Mexicos in Hacienda Heights for Carne Asada Tacos!

I HAD to yelp this particular Tacos Mexicos because it stands head and shoulders above the other locations in town...the food is cooked to order and always fresh compared to some of the mess you can find at the seedier locations throughout Vegas...

To boot, Miercoles is 60 cent taco night! Reminiscent of my days back in high school!!!We stayed here because it was dirt cheap and right next to the highway.  We had flown into Vegas late at night and wanted to crash somewhere for the night before driving to Utah.

The rooms are simple, like every basic hotel room I've been to in the US.  They were clean, had a shower and air conditioning and that's all I really cared about.  I didn't really experience many of the guest except for those who were up gambling at 6am local time.  The breakfast buffet was quite reasonable.

In general, a nice cheap place to stay.We are from so cal so we have an abundance of good korean bbq restaurants.  This place is not up to par but in fairness, it did satisfy our craving for some bbq, korean style.  

Ambience- Spacious but kind dull.  

Food- $19.99 for all you can eat meat is a great deal.  However, the meats were not fresh.  They were all frozen and the marinated kalbi meat tasted kinda "off".  There side dishes were also average at best.  Although, the daicon soup was very delicious.  

Service- Very attentive and came by often to place meat on the grill for and to ask if we needed more meat.  But maybe that was because there weren't that many customers when we went.  

Although, it was average at best, we'd hit this place up again if we get the craving for korean bbq.  

FYI- There are at least two other korean bbq restaurants nearby so don't feel like you don't have any options if you come to Vegas.Sunville Bakery is just a few minutes away from the strip and because of the high ratings on Yelp, I decided to stop by for some goodies for the road trip back home.  The bakery is located in a strip mall and isn't particularly fancy; but the goods are fresh and the prices are fair (most items are about $1.50-$2.50)

Some of the things I tried:
-Pork bun 
-Spongecake with cream
-Apple strudel 
-Pineapple bun

All were pretty average; probably my favorite was the pineapple bun because the crust was very "crusty," if that makes any sense.  It had a baked on crispy top over a fairly soft bread.

There was one girl working behind the counter.  She wasn't particularly friendly, but she was helpful.

Notes:
-Shared parking lot; it was pretty easy to find a space.First off, this place has pretty much everything! We strolled around for about 30 min and filled the cart with the essentials as we just moved to Vegas. Price seemed a bit high but I only had palm beach to compare it to. It wasn't until I went cross town to Standard Restaurant supply and rebought nearly everything. In the process I saved enough to cover the gas and home made chicken Alfredo. Resco was nearly double the price on a lot of items!!WAY OVERRATED. What the heck with these who rated 5 stars?  Their green curry used to be much better - it taste like flavored water now. Pad Thai Noodle is OK, but it's pretty closed to what you eat at a food court in your local shopping mall. Price is OK. Service is OK. But they don't deserve 5 stars, dude.In a large yet hidden plaza rests Komol, a quaint Thai eatery with great lunch specials.  The interior is cozy, and covered in very pretty purple fake flowers.  The paintings on the walls and other knick-knacks all show a lot of Thai pride, and are set up quite well as to not clutter your dining experience.

I came in with a friend for lunch on a Monday for the lunch specials.  There are many options, and all come with an egg roll, and a soup or salad.  Go with the salad, since the peanut sauce is AMAZING.  Just the right amount of sugar and salt.  The vegetable soup was bland and forgettable.   

I ordered the Panang Curry with tofu, my friend got the Indian curry with chicken.  I asked for the Panang extremely spicy, but it came out mild.  The curry was a little chalky, and needed to be cooked a bit longer or needed more water.  The Indian curry was spicy and tasty.  

The menu is very large, and I would come back to try a few more items, even though the ones I had were nothing special.  

The biggest short coming of this place is the time it takes for your food to get to the table.  It wasn't busy at all, and we still waited a good twenty minutes after our soup/salad arrived.Friendly staff, good prices, decent portions. Ambiance is lacking and the few times I've eaten here the food has ranged from average to good-not great. For the price though, I'm a repeat customer, especially given my positive experience with the staff.The Junction is a place where you can play games, watch sports, bar top gaming and good drinks.  Monday/Wednesday/Saturday nights you will find myself and my family there playing with the free poker league. It is a great place because the bartenders are good people, fun to chat with and always there to keep you smiling and with fresh drinks in hand.  They have pool tables, dart boards (electric), Mind Teezers, and even though they are a Chicago Bear bar I don't mind watching my Boston teams play while I play poker. 
If your looking for a local pub to sling back some good drinks/drafts and play/watch some games I would recommend Smoke Ranch Junction.YIKES!  I just read the other reviews for this place and they sound terrifying!!!!  I fortunatly have not had those issues.  The pizza it okay.  It's nothing spectacular and I would say it's a step above frozen pizza.  Since I'm a student at CSN, I get 50% off.  I've been here twice and done take out both times and I haven't had any issues.I have been here twice. The first time rocked.. Was for lunch had a perfect bean tip and chips.. the bean dip was amazing. It had cooked pork mixed in it and was a nice surprise. The chicken Fajitas were tasty and I was onto the best new place in Vegas for Mexican (according to me). 

Then the second trip.. not so good. Dip was flavorless and wasn't anyhting like the last time. The tacos were basic and weren't as good as Putters Taco Basket. So.. thrid time will be the tie breakers.. Let u know..The beer is a 5-star experience - great brew and a knowledgeable staff make the beer here worth the 25 minute trek for me to visit.  However, in 2008 they closed their kitchen so no food is available anymore, which turned this place from a 5 star location to a 3.  No food?!  This is cheap.  Yes, we all know the real income for a location is the bar and gaming.  But the lack of food has turned the bar from a nice place to meet up for lunch into a kinda yucky place to go after work or on the weekend to smoke an entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting.  Beer great.  Staff knowledgeable.  But beer does not an afternoon make.It was our first time ever trying a sonic drive-in and we didn't know that fast food could be so slow! We waited almost 10 minutes or more? I guess they were making our food fresh. 

We ordered the Chicken club toaster sandwich - It was good! It tasted just like the ones you get at a good diner. It tasted like they made it to order and the chicken was crispy and hot. 

The fries were good, we liked dipping them into bbq sauce and the ranch sauce. 

I would definitely order that chicken sandwich again! Hopefully it won't take too long next time.I used to go here all the time when I was younger.  I went (after the bar) with a few friends as a joke one night and it sure was different.  I remember it being packed on Friday/Saturday nights and there were maybe 30 people there when we went.  Of course, nothing is ever the same as when you're little.The food here is the best and service is good. One problem is that the place needs a cleaning. All the tables were dirty the fridge where the large bottles of water are located the glass was filthy. The trash was over flowing and the young girl behind the counter is texting messages instead of cleaning the place. What a five star place this restaurant could be if only they would use some soap and water. But we still loved the food and the price is right.Food is great and on par with other Sonic locations, but this location takes their time getting your food ready in comparisson...especially if you go through the drive thru window! If you go through the window then expect to be in line a while because they're not as quick as they should be. IProbably and understaffed location is my guess.While in Chicago I made the mistake of asking for a thin crust pizza and I was chased out by two burly Paizzzialos with hair on their back.. When I moved here, from the windy city (this is more windy city than Chicago. Few years ago, the Las Vegas Hilton sign, came folding in half in a 140-mile wind, and a guy from Dubuch Iowa, thought it was part of the Vegas free shows-like the pirate show-and he was so sure of it, he was on News at Ten.) 

Las Vegas is probably the thin crust pizza capitol of the world since an Austrian named Puck, who has fed the emaciated starlets in Los Angeles, has brought the thin crust into vogue here. My search for a TCP led to Pizza Hut, specially the one on West Sahara.  I made the mistake of ordering the same at a place called Mr. B's on Paradise Rd.(now defunct for good reasons) and the pizza looked like some one had opened a farmers market on a pizza crust.. There was more cheese than all of  Wisconsin and it left a trail all the way to the kitchen.My friend a life long Vegan has turned carnivorous since then. It took a toll on my taste buds and I had to move back to Chicago for taste rehab..

I continued my search till I bumped into this place, which I have passed by, but had no idea it was an Italian joint, since the name is more like Mr. Bojangles doing a tap dance or house full of  tap dancers? till you go in and the blaring sports on TV and the smoke it is something to do with beer on tap. It is not an open kitchen but you can see through the service window there are few amigos working feverishly and it the turnover is amazing for a tiny kitchen. What the very friendly  waitresses  bring out is undoubtedly the best Veggie pizza I have ever eaten in Vegas or anywhere.

I start drooling by the time I turn corners (I found out there is a name for this-it is called Pavlov reflex). The parking lot is not paved so it is good idea to have a tow truck as your second car or a bring a flag and let everyone know the Eagle has landed.. The rectangle bar has usual suspects on video machines-the kind who play two machines at once with a leg on the stool. This works out for me since I go for the pizza only. The female bartender works like she has sixteen hands-the greatest multi-tasker in the business.

About the pizza, they use the usual veggies but they are oven'd to perfection and a generous sprinkle of parmesan cheese and split peppers-you are in pizza heaven. Once made the mistake of an order to go. It is not the same as eating a piping hot pizza in the restaurant. I guess the smoke in the joint gives that added flavor! The red wine is served at room temperature in a tiny glass,instead of chilled and I am giving two points down for this, since, I consider this a blatant insult to the grape and its ancestry-specially in an Italian eatery.This place hit the spot on a hot sunny day. Our group didn't want something greasy and this was the first place we found on the gps.

Upon arrival, the place looked new! Maybe it was clean, but it was a surprise. Ordered the number one and the number 3 because i was hungry. The meat on both was great! Good flavor. I love how the onions were spicy too.

My cons for this place:
The dressing. It tasted like sour cream, but i wished it tasted like traditional yogurt.
The paper wrapping: my gyro fell apart so easily and i wished they wrapped it completely. They had a small sleeve at one end.
Price: 15 bucks for 2 gyros, no sides and no drink.

Overall, good food.Let me start off with saying I absolutely hate Wal-Mart  and the way that they treat their customers. With that being said I give this store a 3 star rating due to the fact that after a horrific customer service experience I had they called and apologized and gave me a small gift card for my troubles. That small amount of effort goes a long way in today's society. 

I still believe that this corporation strongly needs to reprogram their check out procedures but this store and my experience was not half bad.I don't think Steep&Brew separates itself enough from a place like Starbucks. I know Starbucks gets a lot of crap for burned coffee/bad beans, but I don't think you can insert the name of a local coffee shop and expect everything to be better. 

Steep&Brew just doesn't really seem to have something for me. I didn't like their espresso enough (not really a surprise in the world of espresso) and they didn't have an enormous selection of food.

All else aside, the sticky buns are great when they are warm and sticky and the mochas/lattes will tide you over when you need a fix of caffeine.8 years ago this place would've gotten 5stars and then some, but oh how the mighty have fallen.

Gone are the pretty boxes, the fresh interior, the ever-refreshing menu, the custom-printed hilarious fortune cookies. And here to stay are boring take-out boxes, a worn restaurant with a many-times-amended menu, and no more fun cookies.

I still love Chin's. Nearly every time I've come back to the US in the past few years I've made a point of getting some 10 Ingredient Fried Rice and Cream Cheese Puffs for lunch one day. But it all used to be a lot better. Still. It's tasty and the people there are always nice. Chin up, Chin's!My go-to store for a host of specialty items.  
Pros: Variety, friendly staff, fresh goods.
Cons: It's crowded!!  Parking is getting more and more difficult.  And the store is tight on space.  
I've shopped and eaten (deli, hot bar) at Whole Foods in NYC, DC, San Diego and those are all bigger and offer much more variety.  I'm hopeful Madison can catch up one of these days!I had the salt and pepper shrimp, which comes with a cup of soup and a dessert.  Shrimp was good, plate of about 15, served fried in a peppery batter, with some jalapenos and scallions.  You might not like that they come head-on, legs, shells and all.  Tasted really good, but annoying to eat, thinking - "Do I look like a dumbfuck for picking off the shells?" or "is it dangerous to swallow so many shrimp legs?"  Then again, sucking out that shrimp head gunk presents a dilemma too.  Do you want to look like a nasty slob or not?  I erred on the side of slob.  Burp.  

Soup was vegetable broth and cabbage, carrots, tomatos.  Why even bother, just charge me a dollar less.  FAIL

Dessert (which I had to remind the server to bring out - AFTER we got the check, thank you very much) was a thin tapioca pudding, served in a rice bowl with a soup spoon  Nice sweet (some might say cloying) taste, but the watery texture was off-putting.  FAILI was at this location a week ago and I ordered a new dish they have, its called Thai hot pot, I was really looking forward to try it and unfortunately it failed completely. It was a big bowl with 90% water and 5% coconut milk (if there was any), three pieces of shredded chicken and pork each (all gummy), 5-6 spinach leaves, some noodles at the bottom and a few tomato chunks, the only good thing was the flatbread, nice flavor and crispy. I ate some since I was hungry but I will not ordered it again. This is not the  first time I get a bland dish at this place, I think it's losing quality.It's ok.  Has all of your typical mall stores.  Helped me kill an evening while in Madison on business.  The food court isn't all that great.I had never heard of Pullano's before tonight and decided to try this place out because we had a great value coupon.

My fiance loved the spaghetti and the meatballs were really good. The pizza however was just OK. It had an odd sauce that was too salty, although it wasn't necessarily bad. The bread sticks were nothing to get excited over.

The restaurant itself looked like a lot of fun, but we ordered take-out. We decided that this place was a little expensive for what it was and it probably isn't somewhere we would go without a coupon.Generally speaking, this place overprices their gear and lowballs you if you take anything in to sell/trade.  They do have a great selection, but DEFINITELY don't take anything to trade in, and hope to be able to haggle if you want to buy something here - unless you really, really want one of their used items.

Since you can't respond to owners publicly (or at least I can never figure out how), I'll just say I brought in good gear and was offered less than half of what I got in Craiglist - where I got multiple offers within a couple hours.  Pretty sure I priced it below what they would've done, too, based on similar stuff.  I wasn't trying to "unload" anything, just got a great deal on a better equipment.

Don't get me wrong, this place is way better than Guitar Center, and they always have some amazing guitars in stock - just don't expect to get a good deal on a trade-in.I went there for lunch. Ordered the beef chow fun.  It was very good. but .....  they serve it with a dish that was badly chipped.  Look at the picture.

I also ordered the egg plant with pork hot pot.  It was serve on a plate and not in a hot pot.  It was greasy and terrible.Hmm, this place is a little odd - the clientel is definitely diverse and most of the arcade style games (pinball) were broken, but I didn't hate it.  They do need a patio - like pronto.  For us disgusting people who smoke when we drink, walking out to the front door and staring at Mi Patio or at the lovely alley isn't the greatest.  The alley actually makes me feel like I'm hanging at a college party - and I can't even bring my beer with me.

The best parts you ask?  Well, I'll tell you.  Cheap drinks - $11 for a big pitcher of Blue Moon, and a brand new video game thing on the bar - its the one with Photo Hunt.  You bitches know what I'm talking bout, and you know that you love Photo Hunt too.  Anyway, it was brand new, so now all the top scores are from me - so if you see one with a funny name, it was probably my little hands that did that.  The bartenders were nice, and even though I felt like an outsider when I first ventured in, I think I'd go back again if I was in the mood for a dive.

Also - there are no windows, so can truly lose track of time, be careful!Sherwin is old and not very reliable but he is a really nice guy. I will give him that much. Very good optician as wellA few years ago I decided that having three or four chins was unattractive, so I decided that it was time to hit the gym. I decided to join LA Fitness and began seriously working out at this location to shed some  serious pounds. The gym itself is fairly large and has a lot of equipment but has some drawbacks. First, the place is very dirty and until recently didn't offer any sort of sanitation for the machines or weights. In the summer, or whenever it's warm, the air conditioning seemed to be jacked up making the facility uncomfortably warm, which only encourages more sweating.  The televisions upstairs are a joke... the screens must be 13" if that. Add on the weird crap going on in the men's locker and that was enough for me to find another gym. So, other than the few distractions, I felt comfortable working out here and didn't feel like I had to impress anyone. Three stars for getting me back in top shape.The margaritas  can make a woman suddenly sprout  chest hair and possibly a mustache .   (they cost less than $4.00)  Ay Caramba !

I tried a Baja Style fish taco and was asked if I wanted it grilled or fried..so I picked grilled . The taco had more fish than I was expecting and didn't seem oily , inside was a squirt of house sauce and cabbage . The ratio was mostly fish to vegetables .  I also ordered a chili relleno and I DON'T"T KNOW IF they make it this way all the time but they gave me THE BIGGEST CHILI IN ALL THE WORLD ! My battered pepper filled the whole styrofoam plate with soft cheeses and topped with a chili sauce . I had no idea this side order would be a meal by it's self.

The only thing I didn't care for was the mild salsa , (funky... but the others were OK )  maybe it was just off that day .

My husband had a beef taco and ordered one of the new menu items , the chicken and rice stuffed poblano pepper . The pepper was breaded and deep fried and dressed with a cheesy maybe sour cream and chipotle sauce . 

Tortillas and Beans are free of lard here .

Worth a try for a quick casual meal out that is also inexpensive .Sometimes you CAN judge a book by its cover. This looks like a typical diner and indeed that's what it was. Even though the place was busy (Sunday breakfast time) I was immediately seated, the servers were friendly and everyone used the obligatory "hon" when addressing you, and the food came fast in spite of the busy time. Taste and quality of the food were typical for a diner - OK, not great, but the pancakes were definitely more than I could finish. Not as inexpensive as I though it would be: pancakes (3) with bacon and eggs and a cup of coffee came to a few cents short of 10 bucks! Very casual atmosphere: most of the folks here were attired like they were about to do some home gardening after breakfast.I think it's a shame the way people were bashing this place 2 years & 4 months ago when I last reported on it, & still now!  Mike C. & I were in today for the Lunch Buffet & here's how it was GOOD AGAIN:

*  They are now up to 96 food items, plus sauces & dressings!

*  The Hot & Sour Soup that I wasn't crazy about last time is a new recipe & it's good!

*  Everything was good, especially the Honey Chicken, the boneless spare ribs, & the Mongolian BBQ featuring 4 meats was a treat at this price point.

The staff was friendly, everything was the right temperature & the blinds were still a mess (but I didn't come here to eat the blinds!).  It's down to a high 3 Stars from 4 only because I grade the Buffets more strictly now than I did 2 years ago (& I just got back from Vegas...  OMG!!.)  Anyhow, I still say  this place is TOTALLY A-OK!!     :-))

Lunch Buffet:  Weekdays $6.69/$6.02 Sr, Saturday & Sunday $8.49/$7.64 & they open at 10 AM daily.Great for everyday reading, studying, kid books. starbucks inside if you're that type. just like any other B&N. employees are hard to find sometimes they take a long time just to find a book or even make it to the register. restrooms are dirty. doesn't seem like they are maintained regularly. i mostly come here to buy my son books. they have  nice section for kids. also have a train set they can play with if you wanna play with them or just sit back and have some time for yourself. kids section is probably the best in this store. i uploaded a picture of the entrance of it.I stopped in here for lunch the other day.  I had intended to get there about 11 but it was almost noon and I had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.  Being lunch, any more of a wait and I would have gone elsewhere.  Right now they are running their $8.95 all you can eat pasta special with choice of soup or salad.  I had two different pastas and a big bowl of salad.  I love the pasta and like the salad, the food is always consistent from one location to another.  This location always seems a little more crowded and hectic than the one on 75th. If I could use half stars it would be a 3-1/2.Nick was okay for the most part, did get cut twice  tho (nothing major, it just burned terribly when he applied something right after putting the tips on). His wife (forgot her name) did my spa pedi. She's so nice! Spa pedi included hot stones & towels $17, callous removal $5, full set clear tips $22, I expected to pay $44 & ended up paying $40. They do have 2 different price lists up! Also the nail polish looks OLD. You can tell they're all pretty much thinned out & can see the separation, so I picked a China Glaze color. Decor is outdated and different. I would recommend this salon overall though. I was skeptical since there's only 2 reviews on here but I took a chance on them and love the outcome.Pretty decent sushi for a place in east Mesa. It's in a weird location by Big Lots, a tailor, Dollar Store and more but don't let that stop you from going. I had several of the rolls and they are all good and the prices decent as well. The saki I had wasn't that great and was the cheap kind that tastes like peroxide but they might have better stock.Dos Gringos is a great place to go for a chill happy hour. Although the food and service is just average, they do have good drink specials. Corona's are $2.50 every day and they have other daily specials that are pretty sweet. 

Dos has a great outdoor patio which is great if you have a large group of people that want to sit next to eachother.If you're ever in old town Scottsdale, and want a damn good pizza? This joint will satisfy the craving royally. The inside looks like a grungy porn set from the 80's and music isn't bad when the live DJ is there. I've never really went to this place just to drink...it was always more of a Post-Drunken destination for alcohol absorption... Well any who! Try the monster pizza...I've been going there years and that's my favorite. You can't go wrong with the monster.This is one of those places where I feel like food is an afterthought. An afterthought to what, you ask? Well, I'm not exactly sure. All I know was that nothing was both edible and impressive. 

The hummus was lemony and tahini-y, but seemed mediocre, mostly because the pitas that came with it were stale and cold. They were out of rice and gave us salad instead (as if that's somehow comparable.) Plus, none of it was cheap, and since I should be paying in shekels for this stuff, I was a bit confused as to what warranted its price. Maybe because it's in Old Town Scottsdale and dumb tourists will throw their money at everything made of faux-adobe? Regardless, the rest of us don't appreciate poor value.

On to the better aspects... it's open really, really late. That means you can get a round of hookah at 11 and chill until 1:30 in the morning while waiters constantly bring you new coals and shisha refills. The shisha is decent, too. They have all the flavors your dentist used to offer you in fluoride when you were 7, and then some. We had the cherry, which didn't even taste faintly of medicine, so I was content as far as that goes.

Overall, it's a nice late-night hangout spot. The hookah's good. The outside seating is warm. The food is nether good, nor warm, but that's not why you're there, remember? You're there to enjoy being in a nice setting at one in the morning, as am I.Pretty good.  5 of us decided to try it out.  Sara said her margarita was something to yelp about, so I am.

I had the quesadilla, it was stuffed with veggies but was really messy to eat.  It kept falling apart.  Gary had the meatloaf, he dug his mashed potatoes but said the meatloaf was too spicy.   Emily had a wrap type appetizer.  She really liked hers, and had leftovers.  I never have leftovers, I have a Gary! ha!  Kathy had salad with shrimp, and she ate it all, so it must of been good. 

The cheese tortillas were fantastic! Apparently they have 12 different tortilla flavors. For dessert we had almond flan with berries, SO GOOD!  More please!  And a chocolate cake, I didn't try any of it but it disappeared so it must of been good!

The patio was nice but it's summer in Phoenix so we ate inside.  I don't know if I would go here again.  It might make it's way into my rotation.  Maybe for a drink on the patio in the winter.It's hard for me to give Giligan's an unbiased review because I am obsessed, OBSESSED I TELL YOU, with that hook game thing they have on their patio. Like, my friends won't even take me here anymore because they know I'll spend the whole night hovering around it and betting with strangers on who can do it in the least amount of tries. The thing is in, I'm not even good at it. If there was a hook game on the floor in Vegas, I would be bankrupt. But like many things I'm not good at (pool, darts, singing, cornhole, interacting with the human race), put a few drinks in me and it is my new favorite thing in the world. So, yes, the hook game probably accounts for 2/3 Stars.

Giligin's should always be last on your Scottsdale bar crawl. That way, you're too drunk to notice how gross everything is and can just appreciate it for the fact that they serve gigantic beers that conveniently limit the amount of times you have to stand up and walk back to the bar. Believe it or not, I've eaten here before, and even had their oysters because they have an amazing HH deal for them (I think they're like $.50 a piece or something ridiculous). They were actually pretty good, which even our waitress had doubts about. Jonathon Swift should write a quote about me.

All-in-all, a decent spot for when you're already hammered and want to get a giant corona for like $4 and then spend the time and money you saved by ordering a giant corona gambling on your hand eye coordination in a crowded patio next to a hook in the wall. I know that doesn't sound that great, but trust me it is A-OK.Came in for desert.  Service was terrible.  Ice-cream was good, but was it better than what i can get at a Diary Queen - I am not so sure.  Nostalgic atmosphere for sure, but not a lot else going for it, sorryPumpkin Spiced Latte has just changed my life.

This place gets odd waves of business - one second quiet then - BAM! - line out the door.  Staf is friendly and efficient - we all know what Starbucks sells so, yeah, they have that stuff too.nice lounge. 
not much to add to whats been said except one time I ran a tab and it looked like this:
4 Stolli Vanil's: $20.00   (or something like that)
4 rocks: $8.00
wtf, I realize it's 110 outside but you charge $2.00 for ice per drink??
I'm by no means a cheap@ss but I am a man of principle and thats just lame.I'm giving this place 3 stars as an average. 

I would give the food 4 stars. The pizza was above average. The ingredients are top notch quality, I would have liked a little more cheese though, it was great. Prices were average. The menu was limited though, if you are not in the mood for pizza, don't come here, not really any other options. 

I would give the service 2 stars. Maybe. Our server didn't seem to want to be there, She took our order, someone else brought our food and refilled our tea, server didn't come back again until we were finished eating. We both had empty glasses and she never even offered a refill. Once she brought our check, it took her 10 minutes to come back and pick it up. BTW, she wasn't busy, we saw her standing around talking with the other servers. 

Overall, we may return, the pizza was good but there are a ton of good pizza joints around town with way better service!The best part of this golf course are the mature trees that line the course. It's obvious this course has been around for awhile and it has the charm that comes with one that isn't brand new. This course is less "deserty" than most and I liked that. One thing that surprised me was the amount of wildlife we saw! On one hole, two bobcats had decided to "peacefully" lounge under the trees in the shade, right by my tee box. The bobcats didn't seem aggravated but I decided not to take the chance and moved on down the course without teeing off that hole. 

The amenities are only ok and they didn't have much of a restaurant but the cart girls were on top of it and friendly!

Overall I enjoyed my time here and would come back. It's not as nice as other courses but it's still enjoyable and the price is right! I also learned that they are about to open a new course which looks really nice so I can't wait to give it a try!For our 1 year anniversary, we finally made it to the Salt Cellar.

REALLY??? GET SOME VENTS IN THIS PLACE.  MAYBE EVEN TURN ON THE AIR CONDITIONER.  It was hot and stuffy.  It had a strong odor of fish that punches you right in the nose the second that you head down the stairs.

That being said..this place is a one of the kind and absolutely worth visiting.  This is type of place that I would love to bring guest from out of town...a really neat and interesting restaurant experience.  The facility itself is well worn, interesting, and a bit eclectic.

The food was HIGH quality and very well prepared. We started with the Shrimp San Remo (which I read about on Yelp) and it was excellent.  I have never had anything  like it.  The sauce was even better on bread.  And the mushrooms...oh the mushrooms...oh how I loved thee.
 
I had the stuffed lobster and Ash had the King Crab.  Both were very well prepared and absolutely scrumptious.  The wait and bar staff were all super friendly and well versed on the menu (our waitress even cracked our lobster and crab for us.)  The service was great and they did a very good job of taking care of us.

I will say that being seated at 8:20 for our 7:30 reservations was frustrating and we met several other parties who had also been waiting nearly an hour.  It does make me wonder was this an off night...or why take reservations if you can't even come close to seating at the reserved time?

Overall...I would say you should try it.Wonderful food but the owner is RUDE and Disrespectful.  I would not take the chance.  There are many other restaurants that want the business.   Go somewhere else!(I'm downgrading my rating to three stars this entry...)
I enjoyed Thursdays' dinner so much, I came back the following night and ordered the miso soup and two rolls.  Even though I was hungry, I hardly touched the soup as I found it too salty.  Unless I'm craving for something warm and salty next time, I don't think I'll be having the soup again anytime soon, even if it is complimentary...

Tonight (Friday, 4/10), I tried two rolls off of the happy hour menu- the Philly roll and the Baked salmon roll.  Both were delightful, and I would certainly order them again!!  The Philly roll contains smoked salmon, cream cheese, and cucumber.  The baked salmon roll consists of baked salmon, krabmeat, cucumber, and avocado, and rolled with crispy panko crumbs.  Mmm!!

I'm very happy with Sushi 101!  My only complaints are that 1.) on my last three visits, I noticed that the sushi (vinegared rice) isn't as tangy (?) or as texturally-satisfying as it used to be, and 2.) I'm afraid to sit anywhere but the sushi counter where I know I can get the best service from Tots [short for Tatsuya  (sp?)].  Tots usually works with two other chefs on each side of him (tonight there were four behind the counter).  The one to his left NEVER smiles; He actually looks like he despises working there.  I usually sit in front of Tots' section, but there wasn't any room there for me tonight, so I sat in front of the unsmiling, surly-looking chef, and not once did he even make eye contact with me.  Not even a hello to open up a dialogue or to even acknowledge my presence.  When I mentioned to him that I had a couple of rolls picked out (I was hoping he'd make eye contact so that I could tell him about my food allergy concerns), he just said, without looking at me, "just put it there," and pointed to the counter ledge in front of him.  After the list had been sitting there while he was still busy making other rolls (and more orders were coming in with him taking those orders without looking at mine), I finally shouted out to Tots' if it would be best that I hand him my order since he already knew my food allergies.  The surly chef, without looking at me, took my order slip and handed it to Tots and told him to take it.  Very rude and unprofessional.  (I'm definitely going to have to speak to the owner/manager next time I go back.)   Don't know why Yelp won't let me update my reviews here, so that I can downgrade the rating to reflect the poor customer service skills of this particular chef.  Otherwise, I'm happy with a venue that is very accomodating to their guests who suffer from food allergies!

(Four-star rating for this entry...)

Thursday's (4/09) dinner consisted of miso soup (complimentary if sitting at the sushi counter) and veggie tempura ($3) off of the happy hour menu; the Lobster Dynamite off of the regular menu; and Thursday night's special, the Spiny Caterpillar.

I'm finding that the more I try their miso soup, the less I like it; Soup was very salty, and I probably left about 2/3 untouched.  Veggie tempura, which we specially ordered to consist only of zucchini and sweet potato was good, but the potato needs to be cooked a little longer.  The spider roll was OK, but it couldn't compete with the dinner special, the Spiny Caterpillar.  Usually consisting of soft-shelled crab, crabmeat, avocado, and cucumber rolled in rice wrapped with nori paper and then topped with unagi (eel), I ordered ours with asparagus and taking the place of avocado and cucumber.  The Lobster Dynamite was the hit of the night, however; the usual california roll (though ours had substitutions), rolled in crispy panko, then topped with baked lobster with spicy cream sauce!!  We savored every delicious morsel!!  As usual, I always forget to take pics when Mom is around, so forgive the pics included.

A couple of young men nearby had two identical dishes that looked so enticing that I had to be nosy and ask them what they were called.  One immediatly said "Krazy Maki, and it is awesome!"  Mom and I decided right then and there that we were going to order that the next time we came in.Well, I learned something new a month ago-- SWIHA regulars get a free massage on their birthdays!  Then again, maybe I was told of the deal before, but never got a chance to take advantage of it, because I've had to be at work...  Anyhow, I was made aware of it in advance and was able to secure the day off, so you know where I'll be for 90 minutes in a couple of days :)))  

Apparently, one may also get 50% off all treatments during your entire birthday week!  Hmm... should I give sister SWINA another chance and try out another treatment there?  Thinking about it...

Back to SWIHA- I've a few LMTs (both male and female) I can count on for great massage, body work, and even reflexology sessions here.  If you need their names, just send me a PM, and I'll gladly give you a few names!

Correction: The free massage is with a student, which would've been the reason I never took advantage of it in the past [insurance (now obsolete) and FSA only reimburse claims performed by LMTs].  Since there was a misunderstanding, they offered to oblige me with a massage from an LMT and an employee discount!  Sweet!I initially passed the place up since it is nestled in a typical strip mall off next to a Kinko's just off Rural Road on E University.  I was meeting a friend for a quick, inexpensive and hopefully tasty pre-movie dinner at the Valley Art Theater on Mill.  The decor was what I would call, the "basic, no frills cafeteria like set up" that can be found in many Indian and Thai restaurants I have frequented.  Practical and comfortable.  The staff was friendly and welcoming and the menu had typical Indian fare.
We shared the appetizers, the garlic Naan and vegetable samosas, both were an enjoyable beginning.  I love eggplant, so my go to order is the Baingan Bharta with rice and that is what I had.  It was delicious, I ordered it mild and it had just the right amount of kick.  I restrained myself from not devouring the whole meal and saved enough to take home for a full meal.  As expected, the meal was a great value of $20 with tip.  Not bad for two healthy meals.  When I am craving Indian and over near Mill, I will return to the Delhi Palace again. Namaste.Decent Food. Nothing great but if your nearby and are craving Indian food.... The service was average, the place was clean tidy and empty!Live close to this waterpark.  My little girl loves the childrens park espiecially the little slides. The only thing is the bottom of the pool is a little dirty they need to get one of those pool vacumns out there.. Other then that the wave pool is awesome espicially for those who like to buggy board, the wave goes off every 5-10 minutes so it's not a long wait.  They also have a newer section to the right of the wave pool that is great for kids it's has a long seat in the middle under shade so parents can sit and watch the kids. Also it has 4 smaller slides connected to it that is great for smaller kids as well.Checked Susie's out today with Alexander C.  Perhaps I was too absorbed with the conversation that I didn't notice the food or maybe the food itself just wasn't that special.

Between the four of us we ordered a bit of everything.  The soft tacos with lengua, cabeza and pastor were solid - would've been better with more onions and cilantro.  The green corn tamale was bone dry - it was obvious even before I put it in my mouth - the corn husk looked like it had never seen a drop of water.  My guess is that instead of steaming it to heat it up, they had just baked it or even worse, nuked it.

The best dishes seemed to be the soups - Alex's posole had the right color to it and my albondigas contained some tasty pillowy-soft meatballs.

I don't think Susie's is any cheaper than most of the other Mexican joints I've been at.  In fact, El Nopalito's tacos are only 99cents.  Susie's tacos were $1.45 and up.  Mexican food is in general cheap (depending on how much decor you're willing to give up), so the deciding factor is in the taste which Susie's, unfortunately, did not especially shine at.I did a "to-go" order at Pho Nhat last week and thought it was pretty good, but I wasn't blown away. It's not my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the Valley, but I'll probably go back again to give it a second opinion. I wasn't a huge fan of the peanut sauce since it was more spice and less sweet.

The Bun was tasty, but didn't seem as fresh as some of the other places I've eat at. This could have been because I got it to go, so I'll give it another chance sometime. 

The restaurant seemed clean and bright and it was packed at lunchtime, which is usually a good sign.I usually just come here to get my eyebrows waxed. The whole service only takes a couple of minutes and it is so affordable!The portions were slightly small, despite the high price, but very tasty. The hostess and waitress seemed to have some type of foreign object up their hind quarters all night but the bartender was outstanding. I've seen better bathrooms in a aircraft carrier. Nice place but not worth the price.My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday for lunch. The atmosphere was really nice and had an old-fashioned feel to it. We were seated immediately.

We ordered the following entrees:
1) Grilled Fresh Water Trout with Edamame Succotash, Wilted Spinach and White Miso Beurre Blanc 13.
2) Grilled Chicken Sandwich with Capricho de Cabra Goat Cheese, Fig Jam, Bacon and Arugula on Toasted Ciabatta. Served with Fresh Fruit & Greens with Rosemary-Balsamic Vinaigrette 9.50

I loved the food that I had ordered. The edamame succotash was amazing. The spinach and white miso beurre blanc added a nice dimension to the dish. However, I was not impressed by the sandwich as much. It was nice, but not superb. The chicken was juicy, the bread was soft, and I really enjoyed the rosemary-balsamic vinaigrette. Yet, the dish did not impress me.

Overall, I think I would come back again for the dish I ordered. However, I would not go for the sandwiches. Four years ago I ordered a sandwich that had goat cheese, pecans, and roast beef which also did not impress me.

1-Never again
2-Try once more
3-Average
4-Liked
5-Will come back againIt's just a burger. Sure, it's good, it's cooked to order, and you can top it how you want it. I wouldn't drive 20 miles to eat here. (FYI: cash only)

Pros: It's cheap, about $4 for a burger. The quality of the meet is good, and the cooking crew knows what it's doing. The onion rings are also excellent -- actual rings of onions, no bits and pieces.

Cons: 1) Dingy, dirty, dark. I don't mind the rough and simple setup, but it would be nice if they cleaned all the drips and spots off the condiment bar from time to time. Finding tomato slices in the mustard is not pleasant. Garbage overflowing the barrels is also a problem. 2) The french fries are sub-par. They're undercooked, barely crispy. Stick to the onion rings. 3) The lines. This place doesn't have enough room for all its customers, and it can be a zoo. Go off hours, if you can figure out when that is.The atmosphere here is a very large social gathering and seems to be a great place for the alternative crowd from mill and college kids. The bartenders are pretty fast and spot on. the prices are average. The food is pretty good, and not too expensive. It's a great place to go to spend an evening with friends or to meet new people. It can get pretty busy and the parking lot is not very big so sometimes you have to walk a little bit, but usually not much.I ordered 3 items and delivered in 20 minutes. It's an awesome service for 3 items. 
The restaurant's interior is like an everage typical Chinese restaurant everywhere but the service was fast and friendly. 
The flavor was acceptable for me. It little bit greasy but I guess it depends on the person. There are so many types of Chinese dishes that even more greasy than others. 
I would like to try something else next time especially the pork bun. I saw the pic on the wall and it so tempting. The tofu was fine, not dry-fried, & nice size portion.
Those 3 items that I ordered had similar sauce so I couldn't tell so much the differences. I'll update next time!Like a beacon in the still dark early dawn that held promise of filling an empty stomach.  What I had planned on having for breakfast had turned into something ugly and rather than grab something else I decided to head out and see what I found.

I don't now what their hours are but it seems like any time I am around they are open. The building was originally a Taco Bell, of which a shiny new one is across the street.  I chose to take my food with me this time, not sure a white guy is welcome in that neighborhood before the sun is up.    The place is worn but clean.  I got a potato, bacon, egg burrito that I almost was able to finish for $3.75.  It was OK but not really tasty, like it could have used something but I wasn't about to test their salsa.

By being 2.6, mostly because of the lack of much flavor, it barely made the three scale-Smaller store. Very dark, maybe they don't ever turn the lights on since we live in the Valley of the Sun, right?

-Decent prices...sometimes. Other times, I've found things for a quarter or less than a dollar, so maybe I've gotten spoiled.

-Excellent prices when select things are on sale.

-Somewhat organized, not messy. I don't remember any funky smells, so maybe it smells ok.

-Lots of knick-knacks & household items, some furniture (overpriced!), not a lot of clothing (if that's what you seek).

-Convenient parking.

-Located in downtown Glendale (among neighboring Antique stores in the area).HILARIOUS experience watching live bull riding (horrible riders who fall off in seconds but cool nonetheless), country dancing indoors, and dont want to forget the living, breathing horse roaming dead center of the outdoor bar. A night I won't forget just because I've never experienced anything like it. 

I think my rating would be higher if I was into country to this extreme. It was really interesting watching people dance- twirling and dipping as they do hahaI recently scratched up my brown "pleather" boots by getting them caught in a doorway. I brought them here on a Friday hoping that they could save my beloved boots. After pre-paying the $10 fee, I returned the next Tuesday. I was disappointed in the outcome. The scratches were still very evident and the paint that they used to try to cover it was too dark and made it look worse. They did shine the boots though, so that made it look a little better. Overall, I probably would have been better off just saving my $10 and wearing the boots as they were or just buying a new pair ($80). I don't think it was necessarily their fault since I thought the boots may have been beyond repair, but I definitely left their store feeling really sad and like I wasted my money, which is not how I think one should feel leaving a business. 3 stars.Sunday after church, we would head for Furr's.  I remember grabbing a tray and utensils, moving down the line making my own choices for food.  My mom watching but not interfering.  This was when I learned that I could try new things. 

Today, the line is just not the same, the food choices are smaller, and hit or miss on quality.  It's changed up to AYCE which makes sense, they did charge per item selected.  So when my husband and I are heading out of town and we come across a Furr's we still like to give it a try.Hubby and I came here on the way back home from our grand canyon trip. It got good reviews but we decided for us it was just a 3 star Mexican place. Not half bad, but not overly terrific either! 

My burrito was huge and I was so hungry I stuffed it down so fast but than I couldn't finish the nachos we ordered with our meal. It was a decent burrito. 

Going to the bathroom scared me a little bit, the bathroom was sketchy and we were there kind of late there wasn't a soul in sight except for us and the employees of the taco place.Dined here on two occasions for breakfast while staying here.  Food was great but service was mediocre.

The weekend breakfast buffet had nice options such as a waffle and omelette station, but overpriced at $25 a person for breakfast!

Service was surprisingly spotty, which was surprising given the 5 diamond rating of the resort.Is this the swankiest joint in Las Vegas? No way, but this place does a great job catering to locals, they have great deals, and everyday low prices. The casino is fairly large and doesn't feel cramped. it can get rather smoky at night. But if you are in the neighborhood,  stop in and check it out. What can it hurt? Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!He's like the soup nazi on Seinfeld he's rude to the customers but they keep coming back for the food, I get the italian beef with mozzarella, he charges 50 cents for refills it cost 3 pennies cheapskate only on the strip you can get away with charging drink refillsArriving in the airport:  not a horrible walk/tram ride to the car rental bus, with enough signage to keep on track.

Waiting in the airport to leave, I had more time to look around.  Decent amount of food choices.  Meh shops.  Slot machines to keep you occupied, although I found people watching more fun.

Interesting that they'd have red eye flights (mine was to Tampa via Atlanta) but food places and shops would be closed.  This is one airport where I bet you'd make some $$ after 8pm.  Just saying.The Southwest Airlines staff here is really friendly, and although the airport is a bit loud, it's passsable as far as an airport goes.  Long walks from the C Gates to other terminals, even though the airport is not that big.As the drunks, and the bankrupt try to stand on their two feet and wipe their tears away, I was just trying to get on my flight, weaving between all the crazy people.  The people watching here is unbelievable.  Not to mention the last minute gambling before hopping on the plane back home (love the slots in the Airport).

Security was a breeze and my flight left on time with no hiccups.  Overall this airport is acceptable.  I might have had a stronger opinion if I wasn't recovering from a hangover myself leaving Vegas - full disclosure here.Slots were fairly loose (walked away +$60) for me when I played while on a layover. The Southwest terminal needs some SERIOUS updating. Only 3 sets of bathrooms and 15 outlets (yes I counted as I was bored without being able to charge up my devices) in the entire terminal. Food selection was decent however and reasonably priced for an airport.As airports go, Mccarren isnt up to par on making flyers comfortable.  The free Wifi barely works and the baggage claim and passanger pickup is always a nightmare.  I do not travel often, but i dread going to the airport because it really is that bad.This place is truly old school, and in Vegas that's a rarity. Picture wood and brass decor inside and amazing neon outside. You've gotta appreciate it. It gets so boring walking through all the brand new cookie cutter hotels. They all look the same and have absolutely no character whatsoever. Binion's also seems to have a lot of staff with character. They were friendly to me this time, however, last time I played there the 90 year old cocktail waitress refused to serve me a drink cuz she hadn't seen me play the machine I had just put $20 in. It's okay though, cuz where else in Vegas does an old granny wearing a button up plaid shirt and high waisted jeans yell at you?Casino area has a great staff and a friendly waitress. It has Duncan Donuts which is a plus for me since I love pastries. Lanai express is a good place for a quick place to grab a bite to eat. The buffet was great with a decent selection. As far as the room, it ok and the bathroom was really small. Shower floor looked like it was the only thing that wasn't renovated. All in all I had a great time. We usually stay at the California.I had never stayed downtown before and the feeling and experience is very different from The Strip.
Freemont is very homey and has more of an older crowd than the strip. With the freemont experience and light show and live bands during the summer you can have fun even if you cant go into the casino's.

That said this is about 4 Queens hotel and Casino.

The rooms are decent and clean and well maintained and I never experienced any noise (I stayed on the 10 floor I think).  The hallways leave a little to be desired for and resemble a motel 6. The elevators were speedy and wait was never long so no complaints there, unlike at Imperial Palace.

It has several dining options, the Chicago sports bar, Magnolia's Cafe and Hugo's Cellar (fine dining).  So you will never go hungry.  The slot machine selection was decent for the amount of space it had.  The patrons definitely skew older, say 50 and up.

You can also take the deuce or Wax bus to get to the strip for 2 dollars a ride or 8 dollars for an all day pass. I would reccomend the WAX over the Deuce, otherwise you will be stopping way too much and take forever to get to the strip.Things you have to know

Pros: It has NO RESORT FEE. The room is okay and neat.

Cons: it's a old hotel and it smells bad in lobby and parking lot.
            it's not in the strip area so you have to drive more. Shower is noisy.

It's good choice if you don't want to spend too much money on hotel. I was shocked by their lobby and parking lot in the beginning.  But their room is acceptable.For a downtown hotel, the Four Queens is okay.  It is a good choice for an inexpensive downtown hotel that is convenient to the Fremont Street Experience.  It is not as nice as the Golden Nugget, but it is significantly cheaper.  We usually stay on the strip and occasionally downtown.  In the downtown area, you do not have to do as much walking to go from casino to casino.  They also have live music every night and a party atmosphere.

Four Queens has comfortable rooms and free parking for hotel guests.  However, the parking procedure is a bit of a pain.  You must show both the hotel guest pass and the parking ticket you get when you enter the garage.  If you are missing the guest pass, you pay.  If you are missing the parking entry ticket, you must wait for security to come and check your ID and registration.  They claim that it is to prevent car thefts.  However, you quickly learn to leave the entry ticket and the guest pass both in the car.  So someone having both does not guarantee they own the car.  It just creates a hassle for the guests, especially if you are borrowing a friend's car.

The issue with parking has a good side.  We never had trouble finding a parking space.  We used to stay at the D, when in was the Fitz, and we could always find a parking space, but it usually had a car parked in it.  If you're flying to Vegas and will not have a rental car, who cares about parking?

The casino is extremely smokey. If you are a non-smoker, it means you will probably want to gamble elsewhere.  With the closeness of all the properties on Fremont Street, that is easy to do.  But most of the downtown casinos are very smokey.  For that matter, so are the strip casinos, but strip casinos have better ventilation.

Depending on the location of the room, you may get the noise from Fremont Street.  If you like to party into the wee hours of the morning, that's okay.  If you want to go to sleep before 2 am on the weekends, it could be a problem.  So, if this is you, bring ear plugs.  If you are in a room that does not face Fremont Street, you might not need them, but if you are on the Fremont side, you will definitely need them.Good Place to come once to check out the pictures on the wall. Lots of history on those walls. Just like the rest of downtown, cheap beer and cheap gambling.Just got back from a weekend at Golden Nugget and I have to say the property is great.  A friend got comped a Spa Suite and the rest of us got a double room.  We went as a way to try downtown out.  The suite and rooms where great.  Nice beds and good decor.  I'd give them 5 stars if they where on the strip.  But they're not.  They're downtown and as much as I love being able to walk from casino to casino and all the great neon downtown is just not the place you want to be.   We are all in our 20/30s and we like to meet new people when we travel and they're just aren't a lot of people our age downtown.  Now we did have a good time at the Griffin but in the end we ended up spending a lot on taxis and still didn't get to meet people the same way we would of on the strip or even one of the off strip places like Hard Rock.  I won't be staying downtown again.Like other reviews have noted, expect horrible service.
Located off Fremont street by a couple of blocks, in a seedy area. Expect crack heads and crazy homeless folks around here.
I had a Cuban sandwich that contained chicken instead of beef, but was still good. Hot salsa and chips. Sandwich cane with fries, but why have fries when you can have chips and salsa instead?
Overall, decent food in bad surroundings with bad service.
Bonus points for having Michael Jackson videos on to eat to.A lot of Starbucks reviews this week.  I must be tired.  This is my other Starbucks and the closest one to the courthouses, federal or state.  It's inside the Bank of America building on the first floor.  The Starbucks can only validate before 10am and only for 20 minutes so it's better just to park elsewhere.

The line gets crazy long at this Starbucks and there isn't much room by the pick up counter so I hope you aren't claustrophobic!  The staff here is nice, although not as nice as my neighborhood location, and they do make the hot English muffin sandwiches.  Yay!Once I learned that they do not open until 7am, then everything seemingly got better. I never found out who that girl was that told me to hold on, as I have never seen a girl working there. 

However, the key for success at this location is not going through the drive thru but instead of going inside the gas station and going to the counter.

Service has been good, steady and fast on my last few visits.We eat here when we want to splurge a bit.  Upscale gourmet Italian in the mid-price range ($30ish an entree)

The canolis are great!!!

If you are looking for a little less spendy place on a week night, check out Nora's on the West side.Comparing to the other sushi places around town, this one is definitely fancy smancy.  But the food is just standard-ish for us picky sushi eating Asians.  My friend n I ordered the miso soup, edamame, king roll, sashimi combo, and ahi tuna pizza.  The miso soup has to be the biggest bowl of miso soup I've ever been served at a Japanese restaurant; its almost triple the size of regular bowl of miso soup.  It tasted a bit water-down tho...almost as if its made to ease people into getting use to the flavor of miso.  The only thing we ordered that really stood out to me was the ahi tuna pizza, which i've never seen on any other sushi menus.  It has a teriyaki aioli type of sauce, which creates a harmonious flavor profile with the pizza dough and the ahi tuna sashimi topping.  Overall, the fish was decently fresh, service was nice and friendly, and we left the place satisfied.  We probably won't be going back unless its for a special occasion, mainly because the bill was $80 for what we ordered.For the price and the amount of food you get, I think it's only ok.  I'm a small little girl with a tiny stomach. I went to earls afterwards and put down a salad, a soup, and half a sandwich.  The service was great tho.  It's just a little too quiet in here for me. I almost fell asleep.Over the last couple months I've been bouncing back and forth between the recently purchased new abode and the old house that's currently in escrow.  Numerous meetings with contractors at the new place, back to the old place to meet realtors, contractors, inspectors, blah blah blah.  A few weeks back I decided every time I have to be at the new place to meet a contractor, after the meeting i'll hit a breakfast place.

It's been ages since I've been to Lou's so I decided to include it on my breakfast place list.

Place looks exactly like it did when I tried it over 4 years ago.  I believe the cook was the same ( is it Lou ? ) 

Ordered ham steak, eggs o/e, rye toast.  I believe it was $8.  I expected a lower price given low rent district, presumably low overhead given nothing has changed in the place in over 4 years, so maybe the serving size is ala hash house a go go , uhhhhh, that's a negatory

Food was average - a little too much oil puddling on the eggs but not a big deal given the grease in the hash browns.

Probably closer to 2.5 stars but I round up given the place for so dang long - props to them.Just about the cheapest hotel you can get to on the Strip.  It's not horrible,  and you pay for what you get.  The food options within the hotel, however, are terrible.  Choose here if you really don't care about your accommodations, and plan on spending very little time in your room.  Also, if you can get it for under $99/night through a special, that's probably your best bet.The updated tower is great with comfy beds, a flat screen tv and nice bathrooms at an unbeatable price.  The casino is tacky and old but I kind of like that.  The location is perfect.  The redone pool is nice.  The staff are usually unfriendly in general and we had a huge mess at checkout with my overcharged credit card that they NEVER fixed nor returned a phone call for and I had to do a charge back through my bank.I was very worried about staying here. But when I entered the room I realized everything would be ok. 

The room does have a faint smell, but nothing I can't deal with. The bed is comfortable. Clean towels and sheets, no random hairs that happen sometimes. Carpet is stain free ect. Not terrible for the price I payed.Great budget hotel suitable for the ENTIRE FAMILY. ALSO PROBABLY THE CHEAPEST HOTEL ON THE STRIP, AND I'M NOT INCLUDING CIRCUS CIRCUS -- CIRCUS CIRCUS IS NOT REALLY ON THE STRIP DESPITE WHAT EVERYONE SAYS. IF YOU WANT IN ON ALL THE VEGAS ACTION, BUT ON A BUDGET, STAY AT EXCALIBUR. IT'S CONVENIENT. IT'S FUN. IT'S VEGAS.

If you're in Vegas with the entire family and don't know how to split couple's time with kids' time, this hotel is the PERFECT solution. 

For the kids: Fun Dungeon, an arcade located at the basement of the hotel. Games range from ticket-winning-style to winner gets the stuffed animal style. There's ski ball, basketball hoops, lots of ring tosses, etc. Kids can probably spend the whole day there and alternate between the dungeon and laser tag.

For the whole family, be sure to check out TOURNAMENT OF KINGS. If you're a medieval nerd, this will suit you as well.

For the couples: Dick's Last Resort -- PLEASE DON'T BRING THE KIDS HERE, Lick Me -- it's a candy store, but there's plenty of sexual innuendo toys and candies here, so I doubt you'd want to go as a family, etc.There's no better way to start off a gamblin' trek up the Strip than with a half-yard of frozen boozy slush you can take with you (and get refilled) just about anywhere.

Unfortunately, there are many better ways to spend a late night following said gamblin' trek and about three total yards of frozen boozy slush than curled up on your suite bathroom floor because the cold tile is the only thing reminding you that you are, in fact, still alive.

Take your pick.When our flight got into Vegas a few years ago, it wasn't until 11:00, so we just wanted to stay somewhere that low key and we could get out of early the next day...and they had a room for $39 here.  It was okay...we didn't do much there, but it was in a good location and easy to get in and out of.Not too crowded, close to a bunch of eateries. On the strip, clean.  What more can you ask for!!I love ESPN Zone, but the one in Vegas bugs.  It is way over crowded and hard to even find a bar stool to watch a game.  I'd recommened any other ESPN Zone but this one.  If you wanna watch sports and drink.  You can do that anywhere in Vegas.  But still, I love ESPN and will wait for a table here.  Unlike others, I like the food.  Love that CheesesteakThe setting is actually nice we had our lunch here. The servings are actually big. The booths are equipped with TV & so as there restrooms... It was the first restroom that I have seen with a TV. Server was a bit rough on the edges she was just tossing the coster on the table which is so unprofessional for my taste...Pros: A deal for families and those traveling on a budget. Its located just of the strip and it is close enough to all attractions. It has a circus area full of carnival attractions and games. It has a decent buffet.

Cons: Our tub faucet leaked all night. We had to close the bathroom door because it was so loud. DO NOT PARTAKE IN THE HOTEL PROMOTIONS IN THE LOBBY. THEY ARE A WASTE OF YOUR TIME. THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO GET MONEY OUT OF YOU. DO NOT GO TO THE POLO TOWERS.To use a cliche, "it is what it is."

This place is basically your family owned Olive Garden with a kitschy decor of trinkets and air/railroad liquor bottles. Free flowing jug wine can turn this $20 pasta entree place into a pretty good deal if you drink enough of it.

It's a laid back place just off the Vegas strip behind Flamingo and Sam's (fka Barbary Coast). OK for an occasional visit - just don't go with high expectations.Well upon second glance Battista's is a little less great than I remember... still good but unless you are going for the free-flowing table wine, skip it.  This is not the best italian food, I don't even think it's quite as good as Olive Garden.  

The salad was good.  My boyfriend hates salad so he had the minestrone.  I didn't try it but he said it was good.  Both our entrees (lasagna, chicken parmesan) were fine, but nothing to write home (or a yelp review?) about.  The bread was pretty good.  "Cappucino" or as other reviewers have correctly identified it - Swiss Miss was not hot... not even warm actually.  I guess they fill the mugs in large batches?  How hard is it to pour a cup when it's time to serve it?  

We went through a carafe of the white and a glass or two of red before hitting the dusty trail back to Bill's Gamblin Hall.

Anyway, I like this place... but come on - $22 for lasagna and $26 for chicken parm?  Who are they kidding?  I'd rather pay a more reasonable fee (knock off $10) and then pay a separate price for all you can drink wine.  Because if you don't intend to drink the wine **Read** you are wasting your money.

Wish I could give 2 1/2 but I'm rounding up to 3 for the ambiance.  Very cool :)Welcome to the first, and hopefully last, "Charlie Sheen" review. 

After a long work week where I interacted briefly with thousands of people in English, participated in long client meetings in Spanish and German, and was forced to eat each night  in crowded Las Vegas restaurants - I really needed a quiet, simple home cooked meal to rejuvenate me and enhance my tiger blood and Adonis DNA.

I was far from home, but Meskerem really came through for me. This small Ethiopian restaurant was across from my hotel room in a nearly deserted strip mall with 100 parking spots, but only featuring two or three cars. It's so deserted, it looks more like a place to skateboard, play roller hockey, or facilitate a drug deal. And well, for all I know, this place could be a drug front. Or in other words, a place where Charlie Sheen might hang out when he's not too busy dating porn stars, ranting about practice, and "winning."

When I approached the joint, two Ethiopian guys smoking cigarettes stared at me. And when I entered, I was greeted by a woman with a big smile that was acting as a hostess, server, and bartender. I was the only person inside the humble restaurant that features some old tables, chairs, a full bar, and a flat screen TV (that was showcasing a basketball game). Part of me felt I was in an episode of the Ethiopian version of the Sopranos. It was just two guys sipping coffee and beer at the bar and me. Or in other words, there was just "two and half men." Ba-dum-cha!

I went up the bar and asked for a menu. The server said to sit anywhere and she handed me a paper menu. I was highly entertained and eventually appalled by the number of writing errors in the menu, which included "Red Strip" and "Micalobe" and "Merllo" for beer and wine. Where's the spell check, guys? It looks as if I am dealing with fools and trolls.

Luckily, the joint cooks a whole lot better than it can spell. I ordered "Ye Awaze Tibs" and after a long 20 minutes, I was presented with a huge piece of injera (Ethiopian flat sourdough bread) and my dish of red stew (with beef, onions, and green peppers) on the side. The server then poured my steaming hot dish all over the bread, which included a small veggie side. She then brought over two extra pieces of bread and I dug my face into my meal like Charlie Sheen does cocaine.

It was a nice, filling meal. I just wish it had been spicy (as I had requested). In the end, I got the quiet and simple home cooked meal in an atmosphere where I could relax, watch a game, and sign up for a Twitter account on my Blackberry just so I can follow the man, the myth, the one and only Charlie Sheen.When the cook rhythmically chopped an onion and said "choo choo" as he pushed it across the grill, I felt deeply embarrassed. 

Who is this guy and why is he being so cheesy? Is he insulting my intelligence? Does he know that there aren't any children at the table?!  

Eh, whatever. The food was pretty good.So we went here Friday night and I enjoyed it but my hubby did not. He got filet and lobster and said the filet has. I flavor. We did sushi as an app and the rolls were very good but I didn't understand why they didn't have a rainbow roll :(. The soup was very good but the salad was nasty. The chef did a lot of tricks and kept us laughing. I'm giving it 3 stars because lack of taste on the meat, the waiter was ok a little slow. We waited about 30 minutes which wasn't that bad because we could gamble some more. I'd def come here again but my husband wouldn't!Located within the Venetian, Il Prato is a small, high end shop, that specializes in producing hand made carnival masks, fitting of the casinos overall theme of everything Venice. Not only does Il Prato, have all sorts of beautiful masks for sale, they are also available in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and colors. Il Prato's masks are so beautiful in fact, that as a passer by, it is quite hard to pass this shop by and not give them a look.

However, being the high end shop that it is, in the hotel it is in, in the city it is in, Il Prato is anything but cheap. If you are serious about buying a mask from here, you better have some serious cash on you. It should also be said that the shop does not look happily on people taking pictures of any sort within their shop as can be seen by the numerous signs saying so. 

All in all, if you are in Vegas and find yourself walking through the Venetian, Il Prato is a nice place to browse for that perfect souvenir. Just be ready to pay the hefty price tag!I only come to this hotel for conferences.  Not to gamble or drink.  Its unpredictable.  I do like the fact that they always round up the dollar though.Well apparently the good folks that run this place listened to my last review. Are you ready for this????? They have woke up and smelled the 21st Century..no more coins out of the machines. They actually have *gasp* TICKETS now!!!  And the place no longer smells like vomit.  Nice job to the sirs and madams that run Slots a Fun!Ok
Got a smokin' deal on this hotel on Priceline.
Was very nervous....

BUT AWESOMENESS!
We arrived on a Friday night, no line for check in, got in the newly renovated tower (Monaco).... and found that our room was modernly appointed, with a flatscreen tv and a comfy bed!

So... hells yes I'd stay here again if I wanted to do Vegas uber uber cheap!I have no idea what the rooms look like, but knowing this building has been around quite a while it all you need to know.
The outside looks nice enough, good parking, easy in and out.
The lobby was nice, everything looked clean. Pool table and shuffle board games available to play. The lobby bar is small but nice. The dance area is also small. Bathroom was clean and everything worked well.
What I had seen it's a cool little place, with a bit of old school appeal. If I ever get the opportunity to go back I will.I'll let you all in on a little secret
I FREAKING LOVE M&M'S!
Peanut and almond M&M's to be exact, though I'm digging the pretzel ones now too

Lay's Potato Chips have the slogan (or at least they did), I bet you can't eat just one. 

Well, that's how I am with M&M's. 
Once I open a bag I don't stop eating till there gone. I never, ever leave any for later. On one occasion (maybe it has been two or three) I bought one of those big two pound bags from Target and polished them off in one sitting.

Now, if you're wondering why I'm giving this shop three stars and not more, it's because they charge WAY TOO much for their M&M's. For the price of a small bag here I could buy like four King sized bags from 7-11 or at least two of the humongous two pound bags from Target. Don't get me wrong, I love coming here just to look at all the yummy little treats and cute paraphernalia but I'm no sucker. If I want my M&M's fix I'll go to the 24 hour CVS down the street. I'm no fool.A colorful store chuck a block with M&M's merchandise at tourist prices await!

The girlfriend and I tried to venture into this spot on a Monday afternoon.. but it was just too busy for my liking... so we made our way back to it on Friday morning when things were much much quieter.

There really is anything and everything M&M's related that you could ever possibly dream of.. It's all there.. and it's all emblazoned with the giant M's.

We ended up grabbing a yahtzee game from them with the logos and colours involved. Might as well eh?

It's a great spot in Vegas to bring your kids. In a city of fewer and fewer of those.. it's nice.Cute. Executes the theme really well.

I would advise against the roller coaster ride unless you enjoy a good noggin rattle and subsequent headache.Excellent service, average food. Restaurant prices are very high on the Strip. This Chinese restaurant in New York New York, has more reasonable prices. We had dinner there twice. Nothing was outstanding but nothing was subpar. I would have driven to Chinatown but driving in and out of the Strip is onerous.My husband and I had lunch here a few Saturdays ago. Restaurant was serving both brunch and lunch. We decided to go with the lunch menu. Options included soups, salads, pizzas, pastas and sandwiches. We started with the gazpacho which was outstanding. Very refreshing, ricotta was an aMazing addition and it was the best thing we tried. My husband had the burger which was also excellent...very fresh, and it came with bacon aioli...who doesn't like that??

I had the Sweet Corn agnolloti. It was tasty, but lacked some seasoning. The fresh pasta was excellent and the corn and ricotta was a creative combination. I wouldn't get it again, would go for a different pasta dish. 

Wine list was good with several reasonably priced wines by the glass (hard to find in Vegas). Overall good meal and very good service...however I preferred the menu options and atmosphere at Spago, Wolfgang Pucks restaurant at Caesars Palace, to Postrio.Excellent beef with Broccoli!  Will be backGot dragged here with the rest of our group after leaving the Cosmopolitan, but I guess they're aren't too many great choices to grab some cheap eats on the way back to our hotel.  I don't regularly eat at Chipotle even back in San Jose, but I was exhausted and hungry after a raging afternoon.  

I asked my other friends about what they usually order and decided to try the Burrito Bowl which I hadn't tried before.  Choose whatever you want in it, just like you do with the usual Burritos or Tacos.  The bowl was a decent size, but only tasted good during the first 5 minutes of eating it.  I'd get kind of sick of the taste of this food if I came here on a regular basis.  

That aside, the place was pretty damn busy with all types of Vegas weirdos coming through to eat.  There is a freaking Panda in the same space as Chipotle!  The tables were kinda small and we had to split our group up.  Had a pretty fun time eating here and coming off our afternoon drunkenness.Stayed here for a meeting pre-NAB. It was just off the strip. The rooms are typical of a Westin. The beds are comfy as usual. The meeting space was ok. The pool. Well this is a place to just rest and maybe get a tan. It's small. It is centrally located off the strip. Just south of Balley's and Flamingo. I like that the long time restaurant Batista's is close, the monorail and liquor store.
The Casino is very small. Pretty much one table for a game. The action was slow. They do have a game which i can't  remember the name. It has a side bet - sucker possible but pays 1000 to 1. A friend got the correct cards but didn't play the side bet. Second time that had ever happened.Also not far my hotel, I started my early morning at this hotel/casino and played a couple $25.00 hands of Blackjack. And I won both hands too with the dealer went over 21. "Whoo-hoo!"

With those two winning hands, I wisely and quietly left the blackjack table as a winner. So I rewarded myself with a cup of coffee and breakfast at the Starbucks, located on the same casino level. 

I ordered a Grande Coffee with an add-shot and a Blueberry Muffin. Totaled: $9.25. 

"Man, where are we; at the airport? That is one pricey trip to Starbucks. At least it's free, thanks to my prior winning at the blackjack table.I think the rating this restaurant currently has (3 stars) completely fits the experience that my family and I had. The food at this restaurant is always good. (Except for the calamari, it was TERRIBLE. Chewy, overcooked, and just bad) The family style, flavors, and overall food quality was solid. 
I think the one thing holding this place back is the service. I've never come here and felt my service was good. It's always been just mehhh. We waited forever for our drinks because our server said she keeps running over to bar and they're not ready yet. They should consider a bar runner, for such a large, yet busy restaurant.
Overall, I'll be back. Because the food here is always consistent. I just wish that they changed up their servers and had a little bit more front of the house management.I went here with a friend a few weeks ago after watching the USA Basketball Olympics exhibition at Thomas and Mack.  The food is pretty cool.  I really have no complaints.  They give HUGE portions that you can basically share with 5-6 people per dish.  Spaghetti with meatballs was my preferred dish.  We also had the cheese sticks amongst others.  

It's pretty consistent with the other Buca di Beppo's across the country.  I go to the one in San Diego and it taste pretty similar.Ok, fine, 3.5 stars, but I'm not going to round it up. Although considering we are in the middle of a desert, having quality sushi and fresh seafood is asking for quite a bit.

Their maki qualities are A-Ok. Not great, but satisfying.
Their salmon sashimi, according ot my bf, are also satisfying.
Their hot foods are kinda meh.
My favourite is their clam soup, very seafoody goodness. I had many bowls.

It's pricey: $22 for lunch on a weekend. But what do you expect in Vegas right?

All I know is that my boyfriend, who loves sushi buffet, was happy, and that's enough for me to give it a pass.The restaurant is totally overpriced. The sushi is really nice and I would have preferred to just take from that one and not from the hot food. It felt like they had put all their effort on the buffé interior and nothing on the interior of the room which was a bit boring. 

But as I wrote. If you are really in to sushi this is a Ok place with good location. It was a bit strange that we had to pay extra for a bad cup of coffe.My husband and I have been patients of Dr. Shin now for about three years.  I'd give him four stars since he truly does care about his patients.  However, I'd give the actual facility two stars so I split the difference and gave a total of three.  

They never schedule  enough time for the doctor when there is only one available so your wait time may go into the hours during those time.  Even when there are multiple doctors I've never had a wait time less than hour.  One time I was running late and called to tell them.  I got a "we don't take late patients and treat them as walk-ins" from the front desk.  However, they asked the Dr. if he would still take me even though I would be about 15 minutes late and he said he would.  Of course when I got there they were running behind by an hour so I still had to wait over an hour and a half before I was called back.  

It's also a pain to get your prescriptions refilled since the nurses station rarely picks up the phone and it may take a couple of days for them to call you back.  If it wasn't for the fact that my husband likes Dr. Shin, we'd have been gone a long time ago.

To sum up, good doctor, bad scheduling practices and a poor attitude at the front desk.Round table had a pretty decent lunch buffet reasonably priced at 6 bucks the only down fall was they would lag on keeping fresh pizza available. Went there again last week and they raised the price and now it doesn't include a drink. For about $ 10 now I think I'll pass.Been to Chicago Brewing Company 3 times. Really like the beer but the food has been average. First time, I had clams that were all but flavorless, but my next two meals (blackened chicken quesadillas and then a bbq burger) were better. Still nothing more than you would expect from pub fare.

I've tried most of their beers and they have been consistently good. Of particular note are the Ramblin' Reck Amber Ale, the I.P.A. and the Black Star Stout. Last two times there, the seasonal was a rather nice version of a Belgian Dubbel.I'm the mood for some good Korean/Japanese food before partying it up on the Las Vegas strip? Then you should hit up this spot. Yes I said Korean AND Japanese. You can get your Koren BBQ on and have your sushi too. Sip on soju and then do a sake bomb shot. This place is great!Border Grill's chips were excellent, two of the four salsas were good; we requested hot and we like the tomatillo. Our $49 meal deal from travelzoo came with house margaritas that weren't very good. We had an appetizer platter (chosen for us) to start. It had taquitos, empanadas, and sweet corn tamale. The taquitos were the best, we only wished we had known they were coming because my husband ordered the entree so he was stuck with more of the same. I had beer battered fish tacos which were tasty. I liked that they lacked the creamy slaw that so many places like to add. For dessert, we shared Tres Leche cake. It was drier than those I've had before, but still good. Service was attentive, but the overall meal was just ok. I'm glad we got it at a discount, but I see no reason to return.Paymon's. I've been here enough to write this review with no compunctions or second guessing. 

Starting with the restaurant.. The food is all pretty decent, but none of it seems to be particularly well-executed. And then the bill comes. Now, it's not like this place is super-expensive or anything like that. But it's not cheap, and in the end, I'm never happy with what I've paid for.

Now, the hookah lounge is a bit of a different story. It's marginally comfortable (at best), the service is usually super-friendly, and the hookahs vary wildly in quality. Hookahs only last an hour, and that's if you're lucky, since they don't replace coals. And the cost is about $15. Most other establishments will get you about 2x as much smoking time for the same money. The big redemption is daily happy-hour. 5-7pm, including weekends, gets you half-priced hookahs and a bunch of appetizer and drink specials too.  At half-price, everything is instantly reasonable and worthwhile. Drinks, appetizers, hookahs, etc. Also, while it's not a very comfortable place to lounge and smoke, the decor and atmosphere is usually pretty decent.

I rarely come here to eat anymore, and hardly ever show up outside of happy hour. Everything, from the decor to the food, is just "pretty good," which to me is not enough for what they charge. But happy hour in the hookah lounge definitely makes the place worthwhile. 

PRO-TIP: No hats allowed in the hookah lounge. Take yours off first so you won't look like an idiot.Like most other reviewers, I think Kabuki is best during their happy hour. It's consistently decent Japanese food and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere to chill out in.

The sushi is good. The prices are average.  The eel sauce is excellent though, I wish they would put it under every roll they offer. A big plus is how they always give you edamame with your meal.

I'll definitely go back especially if I happen to be at Town Square having a beer at Yard House.I booked a compact car at Hotwire and it turned out my rental car would be from Avis.  When I got to the counter, only a couple people were waiting in line and I was waited on in a couple minutes.  

The lady who assisted me first told me they didn't have the car I booked and asked me if I wanted to upgrade it to a standard car for $10 a day.  I said no and that I needed something for the price I paid.  So she assigned me something else.  

When I went to downstairs to the parking lot, there was a huge SUV Ford Escape in my lot.  The seats were leather and very nice.  However I do not feel comfortable driving a huge car (because I have never driven one) and I was worried about gas mileage since I was going to Grand Canyon.  

So I decided to swap the car for something smaller.  A different agent helped me the second time and he was very nice and assigned me Ford Focus.  How funny, the first lady at the counter told me I should upgrade to this type for $10 a day.  

So it took me about 30min for the whole process of picking a car up but only a couple minutes for returning.  Easy breeze.  Make sure to point out all the damage because they don't go over with you at all and they don't have the paper work for that either.  

After all, the price I paid was a steal and I did enjoyed the car I rented and no major problem with customer service.Came here for dinner tonight since I havent been back in a while!

I started off with a glass of pearfect martini - very strong. It's suppose to be kettle one vodka with pear puree, but it tasted more like either pear goose or some sort of citron vodka! NOT chilled... :(

My boyfriend and I noticed their menu has changed since we've last been here! No more spaghettti!? por que!?

Any way, Appetizer were sorta kinda the same, but a tad bit different.
We started off with Prosciutto San Daniele, Burrata di Bufala e Pepe Nero (San Daniele Prosciutto, Burrata Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Black Pepper) This dish is exactly the same since our last visit, the mozzarella was light and poofy, it wasn't heavy at all. My boyfriend doesn't like cheese, but for some reason, he really enjoys this dish. 

Bruschetta alla Griglia, Purea di Fagioli, Pomodori, Prezzemolo e Mortadella(Grilled Bruschetta, Bean Puree, Tomatoes, Parsley, Mortadella) EKKKK THE best bruschetta i've ever had, however, they skimped us on the tomatos :(

As for entrees, we ordered :
Linguine alla Vongole, Aglio, Peperoncino, Prezzemolo e Olio Extra Vergine di Oliva(Manila Clams, Chili, Parsley, Garlic, Extra Virgin Olive Oil) The pasta was very el dente, we kinda like ours a little more softer. As for the clams, they were very flavorful, however, I found this dish a little too salty!

Lastly, I ordered the Mezzo Pollo Arrosto con Scarola, Aglio, Peperoncino, Limone e Vino Bianco
(Pan Roasted Organic Half Chicken, Escarole, Garlic, Chili, Lemon, White Wine) Thinking it's the same roasted chicken from wolfgang puck in san francisco! TOTALLY fooled! Nothing like it, chicken was a little dry, but i really enjoyed the veggies that came with the chicken!

Our busser was awesome, very attentive and very sweet! He's a great busser!This place likes to do the whole, "recycle your textbooks here" box at the end of each semester. I am all for recylcing, except when it isn't quite transparent where those recylcled books are going...such as the shelves. At least their new building is sweeeet. Better than that dingy old place they used to have.Local neighborhood pizza joint.  Their pizza flavors are above the popular pizza chains and the price are quite affordable especially with their pizza carry out special.  However I do not recommend getting other items on their menu unless you have to because after all their specialty is pizza and not other type of foods.I'm lucky that I'm able to come during a time when everyone is at work, so I can't really comment on the busy times. 

My biggest complaint? One of the check-in staff is the rudest person I've ever encountered. He never says hi, I have to ask for a towel each time, and he's just straight up impersonal, almost to the point of being hostile. Dude. If you don't like your job, get another one. Everyone else I've ever checked in with manages to make eye contact, say hello, and glance at the screen to know that I get a towel.

Other than that, I enjoy coming here because it's clean, fast, and people don't really bug you.I have a love/hate relationship with this club. The only time I am able to go work out is at 5pm after I get off work. At this time it is always jam packed with people, the parking lot is full and every treadmill/bike/elliptical is taken. I pay $31/month for my membership, towels and daycare. Plus I get one training session a month. It's not terrible and I don't mind the cost, it's when I can't get a machine to work out on is when it bothers me. 

Now-a-days I only go to LVAC for their classes. I love their Wednesday night & Sunday morning kickboxing classes. The instructors are great and take the time to teach you the moves. You just have to get there early because if you don't claim your spot, you won't get one. The classes get crazy busy as well. In fact, I stopped going to Zumba because it was so dang crowded that I couldn't breathe! They also have a rockin' Body Pump class on Wednesday nights. I normally go to that right after kickboxing class is finished.

I have tried 3 different personal trainers at this gym and they all stink. All three of these men were so full of themselves that all they did the whole session was talk about themselves. Annoying! You get one hour with them, they spend 30 minutes filling out a profile on you, you go upstairs and do a 10 minute treadmill test and that barely leaves them 20 minutes to show you a couple of machines. That's it. Totally a waste of my time. 

The good thing about this club is that it is expansive. They have a full daycare center (which my daughter loves) and I can watch her on the treadmill TV's to see if she's behaving, they have a swimming pool, saunas, a women's only gym, a running track, a racquetball court, a classroom upstairs and downstairs and a full juice bar & snack shack. The locker rooms are nice and clean. They have dressing rooms, showers, and plenty of lockers. Just make sure you bring your own lock for them. This club really is beautiful....just wish it wasn't a fight to get a machine or equipment. Like I said I have a love/hate relationship with this place.Descent Mexican food. Not bad but no so wonderful. Sorry was very friendly but painless slow. The place was empty in a Tuesday night but they would hold us a table with a reservation? They push alcoholic drinks... Careful....chicken fajitas were standard fare...chicken mole was a bit sub par but very edible. Friend got chili relleno but complained it tasted of fish? Oh well, we will skip this in the future, but the location is good & atmosphere is fun.... Good modern hipster music.Cheap, convenient place to stock up if you are on your way to the Strip from the MacCarran rental car place.As several reviewer's noted, conventiently located 10 minutes south of the strip far from the hustle and bustle, if you like that sort of thing. For us, and I speak for my family, it worked out beautifully. 

We came with a group of friends occupying a couple 2 bedroom apartment/condo-esque rooms. Las Vegas from what I'm observing, is making staying in the city of sin much more accommodating for visitors staying beyond the weekend evidenced by all the 4-5 diamond non casino hotels. Our rooms came equipped with two bathrooms, two bedrooms, a dining room, kitchen and living room with pull out couch. It comfortably housed 6-8 people.

The resort itself if huge and we had to go through several buildings to get to the main lobby, front desk or to their administrative office for information about their time-share residency option. What stood out for our party was their amazing pool and water slide which the fellas could not get enough of. I'm certain they hit the pool several times a day taking breaks to eat and rest. Overall it'sa good place to stay away from the traffic, close enough in proximity to hit the strip and walk to the market for all your needs.First, let me say I don't like massages.  However, the other 3 people with me do like them and thought they were fantastic.Until last night, this was #2 in my top 3 Sushi. I did discover an amazing place so Sushi Mon drops  into #3. However, they do have an outstanding assortment of special rolls and a very friendly staff. The prices are pretty darn good for a sushi place and you don't really have major quality issues because of it. I would highly suggest this place to friends and family over and over again. It is nicely located and easy to access.Chopstix is a pretty solid place for Chinese takeout. 

The good: 
General Tso's Chicken
Egg Drop Soup
Egg Foo Young
The location
Big portions

The not so good:
Fried Rice (it's always dry)
Mongolian Beef (something about it just isn't right to me, but my husband likes it)

Atmosphere is about zero - I never eat in, always get it to go.

Prices - eh, not sure what to say. It usually costs us about $50 for our dinner, which seems high, but then again, there is usually enough food to give us leftovers for 2 days.It depends who you get. I guess that's anywhere. I went twice and got 2 great hair cuts. Came back last time. . , not so great. I guess I should have taken the names of first two people, but really feel like it's just a haircut. My hair doesn't get anything special to it. It's still better than the one near my house.Pizza was ok .. I ordered a large Verrazano specialty pizza and the crust had kind of a generic taste and sauce was ok but just plain I guess.. Good portion of ingredients. Still not worth 25 dollars plus tip:-(I like this place. I work as a travel agent and love to stay in hotels. This was our first time at Suncoast.

The good: 
-We stayed in the Golf View Room. The view is awesome- beautiful view of the golf course. I almost felt that I was looking at a scene from a different country or a painting that had come to life.  

-The bed was reasonably comfortable. I liked that there were  plenty of chairs in the room.

-Room service: quick service, nicely done.

The not-as-great:
-The room had what appeared to be markings on the ceiling made by previous guests. Don't know why the staff never bothered to clean up. It's a little disconcerting to look up and see a smiley face on the ceiling!   The lamp in our room was very wobbly and needed repair.
-We stayed for a week and we never want to eat at TGIF again. The variety of room service offerings is not very wide, needless to say! Non-TGIF foods were kinda blah.  For variety we would have tried the bagel restaurant but it is so overpriced we refused to step foot in it.  The buffet is average but affordable.  

The gambling floor was the same as most other gambling floors. My partner had a great time (But this was a first-time visit so there is nothing yet for her to compare it to).  She found the tables to be enjoyable and thought the staff were so friendly she wants to come back just to hang out on the floor again.  Not I.

The Suncoast has a cosmic bowling alley, a movie theatre, a showroom, and a few restaurants. For me, it's fine for a short stay, but I wouldn't want to be here for more than a couple of days because there's really not much to do, in my opinion. I like it just fine for a weekend and wouldn't have a problem coming here for a mini-staycation.Osso.  Bucco.  They should change the name, rip out the 90's decor and just serve this.  The House of Osso Bucco would be a five start establishment in my book.  (What I'm trying to say is that this locals casino restaurant serves really freaking good osso bucco.)I like the atmosphere. It's sort a place you would want to walk to in your neighborhood, grab breakfast, and read the newspaper. 
Jamm's has been a voted favorite for awhile and I can see why. But there is always room for improvement. 
On the first trip, I ordered the Provencal omelet. It came with spinach, tomatoes, and cheese. The omelet was very soggy probably because of the main ingredients, but it should never be presented to the customer in the way that it was. It looked more like soup. I have to add, I never appreciate places that put a slap of cheese on top to melt. It tastes better when inside the blanket of egg. 

The pot of bread, which this place is known for is a cool idea. However, if they want to make a pot of gold serving the carb in a cup, they need to perfect the recipe. It's dry. 

Second trip, I ordered the turkey melt on texas toast. It was good. Just make sure you ask for dry toast if you don't like it to be buttered up. 

This place is one of the better breaksfast joints in town. With a few quick improvements it could be even better. 

3 1/2 stars.This is my grocery store for "branded" items (ie: coke, frozen food, dish sponges, etc) I like this Vons cuz its always empty when I go in there...and the check out people are pretty freakin awesome. Oh! its got video poker too if that's on your grocery list too...It's McDonalds. Cheap, quick breakfast. That's about its use. They have free wifi if you like this place.This place is ok but it's always packed and the wait times can be nuts. Food is good but won't rush back- I like then orange chicken.I have been a fan of this diner for years--mostly based on breakfast experiences, but the past couple of visits have brought it down from a better rating in terms of both food and service.  The interior of Hubbard's has a fun, 50's diner decor that was once a novelty, but now seems a dated trend  --and something for which you pay extra to maintain.


On a visit today, my spouse and I asked about an item we had previously loved on the menu, and were told by "Kara" the waitress (who is too good for her job)--that it had been taken off the menu over a year ago.  Not, "so sorry, we no longer carry that" or "i'll pass along your feedback to the mgt" or "you're right, that was great"--just an impatient attitude that we hadn't kept up with the Hubbard Universe of Menu Updates and were wasting her valuable time and attention.

The waitress also went through the motions when it came to service--putting down the plates and asking if we needed anything else as we watched her back walking away from us.  We had to call out and stop her in her tracks for Tabasco---and got the hand. No drink refills, no plates cleared, nothing.  It was the end of the Sunday brunch rush, there were fewer and fewer patrons, and one could sense the changing of the guards, but still. Although we had planned to take advantage of bringing home a slice of pie or another tempting treat from the extensive bakery, our waitress's indifference and later ongoing disappearing act changed our minds--we felt lucky to get the check without waiting forever.

As far as the food goes, our omlettes were delicious, filled with fresh and generous ingredients, but the hashed browns had been on the grill far too long and were practically inedible. Too bad no one asked--not the waitress or the hostess, who never said a word--about anything-- upon our arrival or departure.   The prices at Hubbard's have risen yet again--but the quality of the food and service have not. 


Throughout our latest meal, various workers were scurrying about to finish their side work and clean the floors--one young woman was vigorously sweeping  a pile of restaurant floor ICK right next to our table--clearly raising dust --and taking away our appetites.  I understand that this work must be done--but how about some consideration for patrons who are still trying to eat without dust as a condiment?  If the same vigor had been applied to giving service to diners as was given to the workers' desire to  clean up and leave, we certainly would have had a better experience.When the hype is that nuts, how can a place possibly live up? 
We went early-ish on a Tuesday evening, and were prepared for the infamous wait. The weather was lovely and we got a bottle of wine to enjoy outside while we waited (two hours!) for our table. Okay, it was a long wait and we got 2 bottles. 
By the time our table was ready, we were loaded and starving-Of course it was delicious! The crust was bubbly and crispy, and just slightly charred. The cheese and toppings were fresh and tasty. Then the obvious comparisons to Cibo came in. The quality of pizza was ever-so-slightly better, but when you take into consideration the wait, the limited menu, and cramped dining room, it falls short of its competition up on Fillmore.
I'm glad I went and tried the best rated pizza in Phoenix, but will I go back? Probably not. After all, nothing can live up to that hype.I went there a few months ago on a Saturday with 2 friends.  I arrived at 3:30pm to wait for the 5pm opening.  There were already several tables of people ahead of me.  My friends arrived later and were kind enough to run and get me a glass of wine.  5pm came and excitement buzzed in the air!  Would we make the first cut?  I couldn't see why not, but just then several large parties arrived and went in first...due to the reservations allowed for 6+ rule.  The line started moving and sure enough, the cut-off was right in front of me.  We'd have to wait.   My friends were irritated, even though I'd done the longest wait, but I dug in my heels and said "I'm staying, you guys can go elsewhere if you like".  They stuck with me and we went to the other building for an hour or so.  We had a cheese plate and more wine in the meantime.  Our number was up and we were stuffed into the last table at the back of the room.  We ordered 2 pizzas to share.  They were good but being so thin, not very filling and the dessert selection of tira misu wasn't very exciting.  We got the impression they didn't care much if we were satisfied, just wanted to keep the line outside moving, so I left still a little hungry.    Added annoyance was I forgot to have my parking stub stamped and had to pay the entire fee when I left.  So not a great experience I'd say.   It would be really nice to go there and walk in like a normal guest, not in a herd, and enjoy my first glass of wine WITH my pizza.   Maybe it's better now that it's open during the day?It's a baseball stadium with a pool and TGI Fridays ... other than that ... it's a baseball stadium.This place is decent if you have the patience and stamina to dig through and look through everything.  You definitely need to be in a shopping mood.

Yes, you'll find some great deals, but I think a lot of the items are returns from the stores such as Nordstrom.  If you look at the bottoms of the shoes, they definitely looked like they've been worn before.  However, they're still in great condition and for most people, worth the bargain price.  My girlfriends bought a ton of designer shoes at extremely low prices (ie Jimmy Choos for $100).

As for clothing, you can find some pretty cheap stuff, but again, I think most, not all, are items that have been returned or have defects (ie holes, missing belt).  So look at the clothes carefully before purchasing.  There are no returns.

This is definitely not a place for all, but for die hard bargain hunters this might be worth checking out.We arrived at 8, were told it was a two hour wait on the patio, and we were seated within an hour.  Waiting with perfect margaritas was great--but the salsa choices suck and the chips were a little stale.  There's red-hot red and fiery tomatillo, and the gringo in our group couldn't enjoy chips n salsa at all.  Maybe there's a third option they don't tell you about?  I dunno.  The red salsa tasted like the red peppers you sprinkle on pizza, blended with oil in a Cuisinart.  Not my favoritestyle--I prefer a touch more of the tomato.

My carnitas were pretty bland, frankly, but everything else our table ordered was pretty solid.  Chimis and enchiladas with flavorful, nasty-hot green and red sauces.  This is one place where I'd actually order a hamburger on the side for your out of town guests, just in case they can't stand the heat.

A Phoenix legend that everyone should try for themselves.  I got unlucky this time with my order--ten years ago I remember loving whatever I had.I have no idea how I lived here so long and have never eaten at this location. It seems sacrilegious. I even worked at the Pointe when it was located at South Mountain for many years and still never went to this Phoenix staple. I was determined to go today since I had an event nearby.
   If you like Tex Mex then you might not agree with my three stars and I say go ahead and give it 4 or 5 stars- probably one of the better ones in town. Wow, they even won a Zagat. I'm impressed. 

Pros- 

*Spicy-- Yum
*Chile Rellenos- Huge meal for A La Carte, but that could be a con- too much food. They were tasting okay. Spicy yes but you could still taste the ingredients. That can be a trick in itself to get it right.
*Great salsa/hot sauce- I did not find this salsa very hot though, weird. I liked the salsa a lot. I worked at a lot of Mexican restaurants in my day and I am picky in this regard.
*Guacamole is not that bad for a Tex Mex restaurant. Not the best but good. 
*Wonderful funky decor. It is like a mini Mexican village. Very eclectic. 
*Carlos is amazing!
* I liked that they serve water in actual beer glasses and left me an entire pitcher of water for myself. It was very hot today and their food is pretty spicy. 
* Their bathrooms are cool. 

Cons- 
* The door was locked or hard to open when I got there. Good thing I called and did not leave. Since I was the only one there at the time I thought they were closed. 
*the girl who sat me and first served me was not very friendly
*far away in the middle of nowhere, at least for me. 
*very spicy if you are a lightweight. lol I am not but if you are, beware. Please, ask the server what you should order instead. I overheard him tell others they do have mild choices. 
* I found this restaurant to be very expensive browsing the menu. 

I asked about the gift shop and Carlos laughed at me. He then told me it was closed 14 years ago. I swear I read somewhere they had a gift shop. Oh well. Ha-ha to me. The birthday gift has to be purchased elsewhere, "friend who will remain nameless for now."Pretty lame. It's far away from the strip and outdated. No cool shops and no good places to eat, but if you're into thrill rides and a cool view, you should check it out.Expensive for what you're getting.  Food is good.This review is for their happy hour.

A couple friends recommended their happy hour, saying the 5 dollar vodka drinks and 5 dollar sliders were awesome, so we decided to check it out with a group of us looking for just that, drinks and appetizers. The afternoon we stopped by the bar was full, and the "Red Tables' they designate for happy hour were pretty much full. There was enough room for about half of us to sit down and order drinks. The wait staff did their best by bringing a couple more chairs to put on the ends of the tables, but there just wasn't enough room for a party of 12 to sit down and enjoy cheap vodka drinks and burgers. We did not want to order food if the seating arrangements were not going to work out. The drinks we had were very good by the way, and the servers were fast and friendly with the drinks and our check when we decided to move on. 

The rest of the tables in the bar area were empty, but they said they were for customers who were dining from the dinner menu, not the happy hour menu. Looking at the prices on their dinner menu, I can see that's where they are trying to make money. So why offer such an enticing happy hour, that runs longer than other bars and restaurants, if you can't accomodate the crowd? 

Will probably come back with my wife to actually get to try the happy hour menu, but wouldn't chance bringing a group again.This place is a great concept.  Just needs some fine tuning.
Service for example.  Horrendous.  Worst service of our whole trip which was five days!!
I had a angus burger cause I couldn't pony up the cash for buffalo or american kobe.  Buffalo burgers in SF cost less than HALF of that by the way.
So I put pesto and carmelized onions with peppered bacon and extra pickles.  I also added the sweet potato fries which were nothing to write home about.  The buffalo fries were much better but still nothing special.
Basically this is an overpriced version of the Counter.  EXCEPT they have dessert burgers.
We tried the chocolate burger - a donut with no hole cut in half with a "burger" of chocolate ganache which looked like a turd, strawberries, and this slice of yellow "cheese" that was passionfruit jelly.  One bite was enough.  
It was a fun experience but WAY too pricy for what it is.  And bad service too.Nice burger place. Pros: great attentive service and decent pricing for this area. Cons: food tastes pretty standard, disappointed in quality of fries.The burgers here were pretty decent I suppose. This place is your average fast food restaurant. It is a step above McDonalds and the food is ok, but it's not really anything that I would rant or rave about either way. The server was your typical fast food server, behind the table wasn't rude, there was nothing wrong with him. It had the typical fountain drink type fountain. It was definitely A-Ok, I wouldn't say don't go there. For the Vegas strip it was very decent, it just didn't have anything that made it standout.Genna's introduced me to raspberry Wood Chuck, vodka gimlets, and I'm sure several other drinks. Whenever I went there I could be assured of seeing at least 10 people I like, but the place is infested with hipsters. It's like they're cockroaches addicted to alcohol.Very friendly service here - and for a large group of people, many of the members of which were slightly approaching out of control, this was pretty excellent so hats off to the ladies who took care of us.    The boots of beer are large and appear quickly for sharing.  Tasty pretzels.  The menu itself is pretty standard - I had the sauerbraten sandwich and I guess I was expecting more.  It was a lot drier than I am used to and it seems like it could have absorbed a bit more flavor.  The bread it came on was good and the breaded fries were average.  The husband had the veal schnitnzel and it seemed to be pretty much what we have at our usual place at home.   Average portion sizes.  It was a good drinking place,  though with the live band, it made having any sort of conversation extremely difficult.  The volume was probably at 14 or 15.  Worth trying, though not sure we would put it on our list of must-go places if we make a return trip.This was my first visit to Harvest. The food was very good...nice presentation, solid. My husband had the asparagus soup and the hangar steak entree. I had the asparagus soup, foie gras starter and scallop appetizer as my entree. 
Hostess/manager was very good and professional. Our server was a nice young man..seemed like a student, as all the servers did. I don't have a problem with this but for the price point, he needed polishing. He didn't know the wine list and admitted this, but served my husband a half bottle for $28 with a different name & didn't explain it. We had to ask and he said he thought it was weird too but apparently it's the same vineyard? 
All on all, decent experience, but the service didn't do the food justice.Not my favorite happy hour spot in Madison, but also not my least favorite.

Opus Lounge has daily happy hours from 4:30-7pm where you get 25% off all your drink and food orders. 

The inside is dimly lit, with a modern vibe to it. However, being a lounge, I expected more wrap-around couches. Instead, they had some very low tables surrounded by ottomans, which made for some awkward and not-exactly-comfortable seating arrangements. 

They have a fair amount of cocktail drinks, all of the very sweet and fruity variety. I tried their Loco Coco Café Margarita (mostly because I wanted to say the name as I ordered) and the Whiskey Man. 

Honestly, I wasn't a huge fan of the drinks, as they were definitely more about the presentation than substance (at least to me). 

I have yet to try any of their food here, so I'm still holding on to hopes that it will be good enough for me to add this to my regular happy hour spots.5 stars if you are rich and love to throw your wad around

1 star if you are on a budget and think plastic surgery is terrifying

3 stars if you enjoy window shopping, gawking at the snobbery and mock the fact that some people will spend $3000 on a ugly brown canvas purse with little "LVs" printed on it because it makes you feel good about yourself.

4 stars if you go during a mega-sale weekend when the "normal mall chain stores" have clearance - (Bath and Body Works, Gap, Express, Dillards etc, but they also have an H&M)

All in all, SFS is a sight to see for the good and for the bad.
At the end of the day it makes me want to escape to hills where people put value on the important things in life and not what brand your sunglasses are.Service is alright, food is nothing special but not gonna lie I love going here every once in a while with my little sister because it is just so unique! The place is decorated like an actual rainforest with fake thunderstorms, big moving animals, and gorgeous fish tanks! Not to mention the fun gift shop! 
So no, I wouldn't go here if I was looking for a high end meal, but yes I go here to spend quality time with my sister (I'd even go here with my boyfriend for a date one night) in a fun, kid friendly enviroment. We love it!Not bad but the bowling alley sucks!I stayed here for the first time recently. I have to say there were no major complains at all. The room was advertised as a non-smoking room but it definitely smelled like cigarettes had been smoked recently in the room. Our friends room across the hallway had a funky musty scent- I preferred the smell of smoke to that smell. Other than that, the beds were comfortable enough and the room had enough space. It would have been useful had there been a mini-fridge.

The hotel seemed very kid friendly, so it would be a great option for families. My friends and I went to the pool in the evening and it wasn't too crowded at all. There were families and young folk alike hanging out there. They played Top 40's music on the radio and had plenty of available seating. There was lots of gambling going on at the hotel, and lots of food choices. There were always taxis coming through, and the location is only about a $12-$14 cab ride to the strip. It was an enjoyable stay. I would definitely come here again.This was my fifteenth trip to Vegas - at least. and you know, I never spend any time at the Bellagio - not even for the fancy-dancy fountain show. BUT my DH had only ever been once and stayed primarily at one hotel with a pregnant wife. His one and only experience of Vegas sounded so terribly boring that I had to take him on the full meal deal tour. 

We spend our last afternoon at the sport bar in Bellagio drinking cocktails and betting small time cash on the VLTS. Had a great time meeting people. 

What I will say is that the bar staff is snotty. I ordered a dirty gin martini, they thought I said VIRGIN martini so they just never came back to clarify and never poured me a drink. That was beyond "wow" for me. 

I don't think I'll be staying there anytime soon.If you come to NYNY, you must greet the bobbleheads in the front and then make your way to the alcohol slushie bar and get yourself a freaking 70 ouncer.

Yes, I said it. A 70 OUNCE SLUSHIE DRINK WITH ALCOHOL. Clearly I did not finish it or else I would be drunk for the rest of my life. But it's one of those things that you must try at least once.First time I have stayed at this hotel. We, my bf and I, were there on business this past week. Tried to make a reservation at one of the other hotels but was tooo expensive and many were booked. 

From the moment we got there, everyone was very courteous. The check in staff fixed us up in a nice suite. It was a very nice and exceptionally big room. Had a refrigerato and a bar. You would think they would have a microwave too but no such luck.  The bathroom had a nice oval tub, wish it would have been a jacuzzi tub but still good. The beds and pillows were horrible though. I have to have a comfortable bed or else I am a cranky person. Needless to say I was a cranky person the next day with neck pains. When I complained at check out all she said is that if I had upgraded I would have gotten a more comfortable bed which cost 4k dollars... DUH why didnt I know that!! 
The rooms were under 100 bucks so not too bad overall.Not a bad place to stay - on the monorail line with kitschy attractions to check out inside like the Start Trek Adventure (restaurant and attraction) and Barry Manilow (need I say more). We tried the breakfast buffet since it was free with gold status and it wasn't decent but I would not have been happy if I paid. We stayed in a recently renovated room so that was nice.I stayed here because quite frankly I am a Hilton diamond member so I like the extra perks and the night I was there the room was cost less than the dinner I had too so.  The service was good, but the rooms are all scattered to hell and they have this weird numbering system.  Traveling as much as I do I hate lugging my bags half-way to hell to my hotel room, at least they gave me a room upgrade which makes me want to ask what is their standard room because there was nothing really extra about it.  They stuck me on the 7th floor instead of higher up and the walls are pretty thin.

I would say stay here for conventions if you can't get a room anywhere else (because your company is cheap) since it literally next door to the convention center, you are here on a budget, you are old enough to have watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon, or you are super touristy and its the middle of summer and you have go to Vegas for some reason.

Otherwise my stay was fine, the decor is super dated but it was clean and the Hilton beds are always so comfy.Ols school, but very clean for the Vegas area. They always have good fights to come watch.Walked around here...

Got lost because this place can be confusing on getting out. We walked all around and couldn't find the exit. The maps don't even have a "YOU ARE HERE" sign. 

This place is great for photo ops!Right now probably is not the best time to visit Monte Carlo as their is constant construction going on, inside and outside of the hotel.  First off, the self-parking is non-existent so you have to valet.  I believe there is a tiny lot between MC and NYNY but it is usually full.  Entering the hotel from the valet, you will be at the front desk/lobby which is nice and convenient.   Check in is a breeze and the hotel elevators are located very near the check-in desk.  I'm not sure why this hotel receives such low ratings on the rooms but I found mine to be very nice, clean and had a nice view of the north side of the strip.   Over I oversaw the pool and the construction, I heard NO NOISE at all.  The only downside to the room were the super THIN walls.  I could hear the people next door talking and screaming about some stupid crap that isn't it worth me writing to ya'll about.  Besides that, the room is spacious but not as big as the higher end hotels.  With the price offered on promo deals, you can't really complain about that.  I uploaded a picture of the view from my room on the 29th floor /w construction.  

There aren't too many reviews of the casino, so i'll go ahead and mention that it isn't really all that great.  They offer the usual games.  Blackjack shoe game is decent with surrender option and 3-2 payout.  Penetration isn't all that great for those that understand.  Single deck bj game is the usual crap 6-5...etc.  They have two mini-baccarat games and a few more in the high limit section.  Slots were pretty tight  too.  

The pool was decent but not as good as the ones at MGM, Mandalay etc.  I liked their lazy river but there are too many damn kids around so they definetly need to add an ADULT pool!!!  Lastly, I want to mention the SPA here.  I didn't get any special treatments besides getting a free entrance for the steam/sauna/gym.  It is nothing special and actually pretty crappy.  Think about going into 24 hour fitness and using their steam and sauna rooms...its about the same!To be honest, I thought my stay at the Monte Carlo was just ok. Don't get me wrong, it's an above average place to stay at, clean, semi-new, on strip, and decently priced--but my experience didn't thrill me or anything. Stayed here for four days, three nights and all during that time everything was ok. It's not a destination hotel like MGM, NYNY, Mandalay, Paris, or Planet Hollywood. It's a good place to stay if you not looking for a lot of action and a nice bed with a clean room.

The room was nicely furnished and it was a handicap room, but that really didn't bother us. What did bother us was that the first night we were there we had problems with water drainage in the shower/tub. Water just wasn't draining fast enough and the tub started filling up. Needless to say that was not good. It didn't bother us too much as the next day we called maintenance and by the time we came back from going out for the day they had fixed it.

Probably the bigger issue I had was that the lot they had for self parking was not big enough to accommodate everyone at the hotel. Apparently what had happened was that as part of the City Center construction which is happening right next door, they demolished their parking structure and are currently in the process of building a new one. In the meantime, they have an open air lot that is not big enough to hold everyone. So at night what happens is people are driving around hunting and waiting for parking to  open up. You might say, "well why don't you valet the car, it's free." That is a good idea, too bad almost everyone else has it as well. One night after we had come back we go to valet the car and the line for the valet is packed, come to find out that the valet is full for the night and we have to park at NYNY, which is also right next door. Luckily as we were driving through the small lot to go over to the NYNY someone pulled out and we were able to park in the self park.

Other than that, the only other thing I disliked was the fact that there was no complimentary WIFI or internet at this place. Boo that.I have stayed at cheaper hotels with better service, however the location of the Monte Carlo in the middle of the strip pretty much made up for anything that was lacking. There wasn't anything to special about the room; it was quite standard. The only thing I feel the room was lacking was a coffee maker and fridge. Seriously I can't recall ever staying at a hotel which lacked these amenities. Although I did not have a strip view, I must say that my view was awesome because I was facing the fabulous Monte Carlo pool and the extraordinary City Center! Beautiful in the daylight and absolutely stunning at night! Housekeeping was on point and the front desk was pleasant. My only complaint regarding personel would probably be the snotty ass concierge chick (excuse the tude but she almost got herself embarrassed but I was in a really good mood). The Monte Carlo Casino has to be my favorite on the strip thus far. It's very comfortable without having too young or too old of a crowd; and the music is on point!. Monte Carlo is not a bad choice. Not sure if I will be back to lodge but def will be back to gamble.Good show to see with a date. It is sensual and entertaining, but it didn't blow my mind. I am not a big Cirque groupie, but if you enjoy sensuality and physicality combined with nice lighting, then go see this show. 

IMHO, worth seeing if you can get discounted or comped tickets, but I would not pay full price.  The theater is designed so that nearly every seat has a good view of the action.Quickly deposited $40 in one of their slot machines.  Not a single hit on anything.  A cocktail waitress finally appeared, and I ordered a drink.  I sat there and sat there and sat there, but she never returned with it.  So I gave up and left.  Disappointed.I like the Venetian. I've stayed here three times now, and I really like how large the suites are, and that it's the only hotel on the strip that offers a sofa-sleeper in the suite. (If i'm wrong, please correct me, but I called around and it seemed as though only the Venetian had it). 

With regards to the Venezia suites in particular: The bathrooms were quite large, with a tub, a shower, and a separate toilet. That was great, because no one showering wants to watch you do your business on the john. The sofa area was spacious, and definitely large enough to accommodate more than 4 people, which they mention in the bookings information. 

The view of the pool garden was beautiful, even if placement of the pool garden is less than ideal (when it's between four tall buildings, you can bet it doesn't get a lot of sunlight). The water pressure in the showers was perfect, even if I couldn't figure out how to adjust the temperature; it was perfect to begin with, and required very little tweaking on my part. Having Tao in the building was pretty helpful after hours spent dancing in a crowded club.

Housekeeping is hit or miss: we had someone really good come in the first day and give us everything we asked for (we tipped quite generously for that), and the second day, we asked for less and tipped less and the person who came in took the tip but didn't give us what we were asking for. Also, our suite was missing a corkscrew and it took about an hour for them to send one up. This delay resulted in us chugging our bottle of wine as we headed down to Tao. Also, the location on the strip means you are on one side, and need to exert extra effort to go to Paris or New York or even the Bellagio. 

The next time I come to Vegas, I will probably give another hotel a shot. But the Venetian has served me well for my purposes.After staying at the Palazzo in the last 1 1/2 yrs, coming back to the Venetian was a shock!  They have reduced the amenities to bare minimum.  No more ropes or slippers.  No vanity kit or shoe horn.  The 'new' dresser has no drawers.  And you call yourself 5-diamonds?  I think NOT!

What really upset me about Venetian is that they seem to always run out of rooms when I check in at midnight.  Then I ended up either in a handicap room or a smoking room.  I NEVER had this problem at the Palazzo.  The front desk said 'I'm sorry but we are fully committed.'  WTF?  Didn't I have a reservation for a NON-SMOKING room?  Was my reservation NOT committed?  And I did say on my reservation that I'd be arriving at midnight!  

Venetian, you SUCK!Danny Gans is everywhere.  On the outside, on my chips, on the brochures, on the flyers, on the website.  Lucky for my boyfriend, the Danny Gans chips brought him luck at the Blackjack tables.

One star for location and cleanliness
One star for the beautiful pool
One star for  all the restaurants and mostly friendly dealers

I took away one star because we were told we'd get a remodeled room (as everyone else in our group did) but we didn't.  They must have been remodeling the room above ours because at 9 am we'd hear everything they were doing up there.

I took away another star because some of the staff (not dealers) were a little rude.  I got charged for a buffet on my credit card even though they told me the scanner was broken after my card was swiped.  So instead I paid cash and later found the charge on my card.  When I called to dispute they wanted nothing to do with me.  I also wish they had more servers around the pool and that the tasty frozen drinks weren't $16-$20.  I paid the price, though, so I guess I'm not that thrifty.

I'll probably stay here again since all the rooms should be remodeled by the end of the summer.  I wish the volcano was working, but again, it should be the next time I visit.I wish you could give half ratings on this website. I'd give this hotel a 3.5

After visiting vegas a few times, I finally decided to try out The Mirage. For the most part everything was GREAT! Checked-in with a girl behind the desk. Her name was Ashley. SUPER SWEET GIRL!! She took off our resort fee of $56 for choosing to stay at the hotel. I had asked for a room with a view when I booked this hotel and got what I asked for. Room service is great!! (overpriced but you expect that in every hotel). The staff were very prompt and friendly. LOVE the hotel's atmosphere. The pool is a good size and there is a lot of room to spread out with your group. Food and drink service around the pool as well. VERY CLEAN considering all the drunk people everywhere with their beer bottles and whatnot.

 I only really have two complaints about the hotel.
1. ROOMS- The rooms aren't as big as the pictures perceived them to be. The air conditioner was also in an awkward spot in the room, which left most of the room very warm. I wasn't expecting anything HUGE in terms of size, but I was expecting a little more space to move around. The bathroom was also a little on the small side. My biggest problem with the room was the door. IT ONLY HAD A DEAD BOLT. Most doors that I'm aware of have both a door lock and dead bolt lock. I think if they took the time to update the rooms, this hotel would be outstanding.

2. RUDE GIRL WORKING AT REVOLUTION- I didn't get her name, but she had what most girls would call a "constant bitch face". Didn't spend anytime in revolution but had asked her for directions, I was very unimpressed with her bitchy attitude, I reported her at check-out. SORRY YOU HATE YOUR JOB SO MUCH HONEY

That being said, if I were to stay here again, id probably go for a bigger room.Not worth the money.

This place makes me wonder how Emeril is considered a great chef.

From the salad to the steak, I remember everything here being too salty. "Let's kick it up a notch" my a$$. It seemed more like let's cover up the fact that I can't cook with tons of salt.

By the time I left the restaurant, I felt like my blood pressure must be sky high with all the salt I ingested. 

Needless to say, I won't be going back here again.MGM Grand. The hotel with all the big boxing matches and the lion "habitat". It was the first time I stayed here and we found it for a pretty reasonable price. 

A big heads up when parking in their structure is to remember exactly where you parked. It could get kind of confusing and you may get lost. Checking in was really quick and rooms are pretty spacious. One of the biggest downers was that when we made room reservations online the website said we would have free buffet tickets. When my husband went to check in the girl at the front desk said she had no indication of that special on the system. She stated that if there was something on the confirmation email or if we have proof she could give it to us. I was totally bummed even though my husband screenshot it on his ipad from the website we didn't decide to pursue it. We kind of forgot about it. Still a big let down though.

The room was pretty spacious but the television was a little dated. One of the big things I look for in a hotel room is a flat screen and this television was a little old school. The room was fairly clean minus the pillow with "stains" on it. Yes, I know. I have watched all those little news specials about how disgustingly dirty 5 star hotel rooms are and how many stains are on the walls and comforters using a blacklight. The only thing is I didn't have a blacklight and the stains were just there. Mind you it was only the decoration pillow but it was pressed up against the pillows we were supposed to sleep on. I threw it on the side of the room and opted to not have the room service clean so they don't put it back on the bed. Aside from that the bed was amazing and I had the best sleep there on my vacation.

The hotel is location is pretty good too especially if you are driving since its more toward the beginning of the strip. There's lots of restaurants and lounges in the hotel that you can choose from but the hotel is currently under some renovation. You can also walk next door to New York New York or to the other nearby hotels. Great thing is that it is located at the beginning of the monorail if you want to blow $15 bucks for an all day pass to use the monorail on the strip. Overall good experience for the price.Do you like urine and facial hair scattered around your bathroom? .................... Neither do I. That my friends, is the difference between a 4 star and a 3 star review.

I booked a "New Grand King" room through Hotels.com. The room at first glance was beautiful. It was a recently re-modeled room, complete with a bright (and huge) vanity-style bathroom mirror (any gal's dream), a huge bed, and a big window with a city view. I loved it.... until of course I noticed (what I assumed was) urine stains all over the toilet, and (what I'm sure was) facial hair sprinkled all over the sink. Yay. If that's not sure to turn a smile into a frown then I don't know what is.

Other than that, we enjoyed our stay. I wasn't particulary fond of the bed pillows, but my boyfriend thought our bed was very comfortable. We didn't have any other problems with the room, and the service at the MGM Grand was excellent.

A word of advice: don't go to the MGM Grand buffet unless you like being disappointed. It was terrible. On the bright side, there is a small fourt court inside the Casino (with a 24 hr Mcdonald's for all of you late-night drunkies), in addition to Starbucks and a few other cafes and restaurants.

**WHEN CHECKING OUT: Don't wait in the insanely long line in the lobby. Use your room phone to call Guest Services and check-out that way (that's what we did, and it was a breeze). You can also check-out using your television.**

Overall, I'm not sure if I would stay here again.Treasure Island is a great choice if you:

a) Don't wanna throw down a lot of money for a hotel but you,...
b) Don't wanna stay in a trashy, smoke-y hotel with 90-year old retired Floridians or recently married 20-year olds, and you,...
c) Wanna be "where the action is" on the Vegas strip, not somewhere in the boonies.

Following Puff Daddy's and Prince's lead, the hotel formerly known as "Treasure Island" is now "T.I.".  They recently remodeled some of the lower floors so the rooms are more modern, clean and classy.  T.I. only gets 3 stars from me because three aren't any good restaurants at T.I., and there isn't even a concierge.  BUT, T.I. is relatively inexpensive and the location is EXCELLENT - it's literally only a 3-5 minute walk to The Wynn, The Venetian and also the Fashion Show Mall.  Perfecto.

Would I stay here again?  Definitely.I think it's a beautiful hotel but is a tad bit expensive. They charge you a resort fee whether you use the pool or not. I went in March and it was quite cool so not really worth being outside. 
The hotel smelled a little bit funky almost like a church smell. It was almost overbearing at time. The room was nice and it's cool that you get upfront privileges to see the sirens show. I really liked it but it wasn't the best hotel I've ever stayed in. I think the hotel itself is beautiful.We needed a room to "crash" after checking out of our previous hotel and before our evening drive home. TI was relatively cheap for our intent and the room was quite nice albeit a tad small. The bed was super comfy for that pre drive nap we needed and the lunch buffet was an excellent deal at the 2 for 1 deal we got with our reservation from the TI mail  promotional link.

I'm sure we'd stay here again if we get another adult only vacation in the future.Oh Treasure Island, and your old-school pirate show, where have you gone?  Welcome to TI, and the scantily clad pirate show...my have times have changed.  Across the street from the Venetian/Palazzo sits TI.  Definitely has seen better days, and by that I mean pretty much everything.  Rooms, casino, food.  If you want to save a few bucks and stay down at this end of the Strip, this is your place.  Just be prepared to hear the pirate show every night!I'll admit that the lovely patio, overlooking the Strip and Bellagio fountains, might justify picking this restaurant. However, if you're not going here for the atmosphere, don't go here at all. The food and service are just mediocre. The free baguettes are the best part -  the French onion soup and the two apps I tried (escargot and chips with blue cheese dip) were just okay. This is French bistro fare commercialized (those from the Chicago area will know that this is a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, all of which I have found to be underwhelming). Service wasn't their strong suit either. When we walked in, around 6PM on a Monday evening, and told them we just wanted some drinks and apps, the hostess said she couldn't seat us for that. After looking around at the 75% empty dining room and probably looking at her strangely, she called her manager to get the OK to seat us. As someone who's worked as a restaurant server, I can tell you that any place should be thrilled to have a table like that - high tab from alcohol and quick turnover. Then our server seemed a bit out of it. So if you're just looking for a reasonably priced place overlooking the Bellagio fountains, Mon Ami will fit the bill, but if you care equally about the food and service, you'll be a bit disappointed.You can't beat the location and the lively vibe here.

The food was alright but I've had much better elsewhere on the Strip.Mon Ami Gabi has one of the best locations on the strip - right in front of the Paris, with a gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountains.  Unfortunately, they don't take reservations for patio seating and the wait can get pretty long.  We gave up and opted to sit inside as a result.

In terms of the food, I'd recommend the escargot, French onion soup, and duck confit.  I'd suggest skipping the pate.  Overall, food was OK, but definitely a bit overboard in sodium content.  Most of the dishes were great for the first few bites, but quickly became too rich / too salty.  

Indoor seating is also extremely dark / stuffy (perhaps an interior remodel, additional lights, new furniture, etc. would help).  Overall, it's a nice place to eat if you're here for the view and manage to snag an outdoor table, but I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way to come back.There is a waiting line if u want to dine on the patio, you can wait at the bar and spend $11 for a Mimosa or spend your money gambling in the casino. Or just wait till the buzzer calls you, but then, why did you come to Vegas for? Great place to people watch and have an overpriced sliced tomato with some stinky cheese called salad. The quiche is good too, if you like quiches. You get a baguette and some butter to start with, but don't spend too much, just enjoy the good weather and the funny dressed tourists taking pictures of the Eiffel tower.I think this place used to be great.  Now, I feel like it's alright.  There's a lot of hype for big pieces of steak which I'm just not that into anymore. My food was undercooked and my mom's was waay to well done. Overall good atmosphere, although they try to maximize their customers and cram everyone into tight spots.pretty decent for brunch, had the maserati omelet, not bad.  
$10-14 most plates, BIG shareable portions...Pretty decent. No fridge, microwave, coffee maker, or WiFi in our room though. Kind of a bummer. Check-in man was really unpleasant and talked so softly I could barely hear him. Elevators are SCARY! I wish I could have known this before telling him I was okay with the 22nd floor! REALLY rocky and noisy! Thought I was going to die. 

Other than that, it was just fine. Pretty room, decent view, cool pool, good bar.Over my last ten visits to Las Vegas, I have stayed at the Luxor four of those times. I have personally stayed at many other upscale hotels in Las Vegas, but for an honest and reasonable price, the Luxor is where its at.

The Luxor provides the whole Vegas feel, with their iconic structure and design, and like I said, for a very reasonable price. The few disadvantages are that its more towards the beginning of the strip, so a little walking will be done to get more into the middle of the strip, but the connections to the Excalibur and New York New York, make it a little easier to get ahead on the Strip. I'd say this hotel is very kid friendly and also provides a fairly big casino.

The Luxor is also home to ( believe it or not ) probably the best or one of the best shows i've seen in Vegas. I have to admit I was very skeptical but after reading the reviews I had to give it a try, and it did not disappoint one bit. Hilarious show, its a must see.

I also enjoy the Luxor's pool area. Very classic Egyptian feel to it, almost like an Oasis of endless water. Club LAX is also one of the nicer clubs I have been to in Vegas, and i've been to some very trashy ones before.

Overall, great place. They can add a little more excitement to the Casino floor, maybe more music, party atmosphere going on but other than that, good job.Oh Mandalay, your rooms are nice and classy, your restaurants are excellent, your pools are the stuff Vegas is made of (including the difficulty in getting a chair factor) but your casino floor is just an unhappy place.  Never, ever have I had card dealers who looked so unhappy and were so unfriendly.

I made my $300 casino donation, I just wish I had done it with a smile on my face.  I just don't like gambling at your casino.I echo the previous review by Heidi about this Las Vegas property. I am also a Shell owner and this was my first time to the Desert Rose. I agree the photos on the website make it look more high-end than it really is.  While the property and room were clean, the room was a little drab and is in need of updating. The bathroom tub did not drain properly and the bathroom itself is in need of a complete renovation. 

The location of the resort is convenient, located at the south end of the strip, near to Hooters and the Tropicana and across from MGM Grand. The pool was crowded when we were here in June and we basically only used the room to sleep anyway. Staff were nice and competent, however the concierge on duty was a joke and not helpful at all.The BOA 405 cocktail is a must and possibly my favorite thing about the dining experience.  My filet was decent but I've had better, the lobster was slightly fishy and the potatoes with cheddar and bacon were runny.  The place was also oddly empty for 8:30 PM on a Thursday.  My advice is to grab a cocktail and sit on the patio over looking the strip.yes that is correct three stars ... i had high hopes for craftsteak.  as a fan of top chef i thought it would be fun to try tom collichios food.  but tom collichio isnt even exec chef here.  hes just owner and chef.  exec chef is someone else

we made a reservation for 8pm.  we got there 10 minutes early and they notified us that they were 10-15 minutes behind on reservations.  they told us we could hang out at the bar.  when we went to the bar it was crowded and not an open seat in sight.  so why would they even tell us to go to the bar if we couldnt be served there?  i was starving so i waited at the bar for a seat then sat down and ordered lobster bisque.  it had generous chunks of lobster in it.  pretty good.  very creamy.

8:30 we finally sit down.  good timing since if they had walked over a second later i wouldve stomped over there and asked why we had to wait 30 minutes for a reserved table.  some people walked up and had no such delay.  i have no idea why. 

the sommelier came to help us with wine selection.  but never came back to ask us what we decided on.

onto our wacko waiter.  we had questions about the menu especially the set dinners and he answered them.  to make a long story short.  he answered them wrong and confused the hell out of us.  he told us that not everyone had to get the same set meals.  he told us that the domestic wagyu surf and turf meals came with two lobsters. i was thinking o wow.  thats a lot of food.  when he came back to take our order, he told us we all had to get the surf and turf.  he also told us we could get crab legs instead of lobster.  

anyways.  in the end two of us got the surf and turf that came with two salads, two desserts, one kobe style wagyu new york strip and one ribeye, and two sides.  the others got prime ribe and one got scallops.

we ended up with heirloom tomatoes, beets and pickled egg, grilled shrimp for appetizers.  then corn, sauteed spinach, japanese eggplant, baby brocoli or brocolini for sides.  the corn was super buttery.  spinach was good.  eggplant was over seasoned with pesto and undercooked a bit.

the meat of course was delicious.  the lobster and scallops were good too.  the ribeye was the best texture out of all the meats.  cooked to a perfect medium rare.  very tender.  the strip had a different flavor but still good.

for desserts we had chocolate lava cake, monkey bread, and fruit and sorbet.

the decor was rustic but modern.  there was actually a lot a lighting but it was done in a way that made the room still dark.  high ceilings.

i think because of the service hiccups i would actually try other restaurants before coming back here.Best Vaginal themed mexican restraunt on earth!  Other reviewers knock the lack of authenticity.  But, frankly, if I'm eating at a mexican restraunt named after a woman's anatomy I'm not necessarily looking for the place to be following strict traditional guidelines.  So, whatever.  The guac and the salsa are both really good here.  The food is fresh and good quality.  It certainly is overpriced, but its very nice and the waitstaff is RETARDED hot.

eww, this is starting to sound like a review from hooter's.  i quit.REALLY wanted to love this place, but i was not impressed. My husband raves about it everytime he comes home from vegas so it was one of the first reservations we made when we planned our trip. nothing exceptional but not terrible. 

have to say that their epi bread is to die for.  my favorite part of a baguette is the end (extra crusty) and providing the wheat-shaped bread/epi loaf (with multiple "ends") instead of sliced baguette or rolls is perfect. 

started with some cold mussels and the breaded bone-marrow appetizer special.  i absolutely love me some bone marrow, but when she said it was breaded and fried, it made me think twice.  i should've listened to my gut (literally) and passed on that.  almost everything is better fried, but NOT bone marrow. just say no! keep it simple and traditional. the mussels were tiny and nothing special. 

my ribeye was perfectly cooked and delicious. husband had the steak frites, his usual, but it paled in comparison to the ribeye.  obviously they are different cuts of beef, but my husband mentioned that they were having an off night.  the frites were perfect.  no dessert because we were full of frites and we didn't want to risk a hit/miss dessert.  we wanted to try bouchon bakery downstairs anyways. 

had very high hopes and expectations for our meal, but it was just ok.  i might like to try them again for brunch, but with all the other choices in vegas i most likely won't be back to bouchon. unfotunate.This is an oldie but a goodie.  A few years ago this was my very first Vegas club experience.  (I didn't know any better, but I've wised up).  However, I had a blast.  The best drinks in all of Vegas!!!!
We started our evening here by eating dinner, which was excellent.  We were planning on going to another club that evening, but since we ate dinner there my boyfriend (now my fiance) and I  were offered a free front of the line pass to come back later in the evening when the club began.  So we decided "what the heck it's free & we're already here".  

Glad we stayed.  We discovered the best drinks ever, Rum Jungle Juice and the Havana Cabana (my fav).  Both are a concoction of various rums.  Rum Jungle Juice is like a Long Island Ice Tea, all alcohol but it actually tastes good.  The Havana Cabana is a mixture of rums and pineapple juice and a sugar cane stick for mixing.  I can't begin to tell you how delicious this drink is, you just have to try it.

The layout of the club has some great aspects.  The front of the club by the walls of fire and water, has lounge chairs and tables for everyone.  Finally a club where you can sit down without being a VIP.  The bathroom is gorgeous, make sure you look up into the starlit ceiling.  The ceiling of the club is littered with various cages, trapezes and walkways filled with dancers and arial artists.  One of the most unique features of the club is the music.  Rum Jungle has a DJ along with live drummers and percussionists.  This makes for great music to dance too and truly original music mixes.  However, the dance floor is laid out weird and is a little tiny.  With a random stripper pole in the corner (which was occupied by some not so attractive older women).  The bar is long but is also right in the middle of the main walkway to both the VIP tables and dance floor.    So it can get a little bottle necked and become a tight fit to get drinks.

The only draw back to this club is the crowd.  Mostly older and unattractive, but not rich and well put together like at Tryst.   Let's just say when they began to play Kelly Clarkson the entire dance floor began to scream. YIKES!  

Overall a great place to grab a few drinks listen to some original music mixes, relax in the lounge and move on to a bigger and more popular club on the strip.  But go at least once to try a Havana Cabana, I promise it's yummy.At 4am when you're starving... and after what I'm gonna guess was a lengthy night of drinking, the $7.77 steak and shrimp hits the spot.

Don't expect much from the service but then again... if you have alcohol in your system you probably don't care that much except you might say "WHERE is my food?" about 8 billion times. 

The eggs benedict here wasn't good. Maybe because I wasn't drunk.

Your Lesson: Eat the steak and shrimp and nothing else, but only after drinks and you will acheive SUCCESS.So, they may as well have played "Glory Days" when I walked in here for dinner the other night. I have very fond memories of this place from when I was in my early 20s and used to visit friends that went to school here. Maybe I was one of those annoying people that Yelpers are complaining about being drunk and obnoxious. 
However, going there in my 30's is quite a different experience, namely we went there before Midnight. That being said, no matter what the "Dane" does it will always have a special place in my heart. 
Okay, the food.....The food is okay. I think it is the place where you just order a burger or the like because their menu is quite extensive and I am not sure they have the skill or food quality to really pull off all sorts of different genres of good. I usually stick to the Veggie burger and Portabella and they turn out great. Some of the other food ordered at our tables.....not so great. 
Beer: One of the beers my husband ordered came at room temp, which would be fine if we were in England however he didn't know it came warm and when we inquired the server just said "it came off the pull tap" Okayyy....what the hell does that mean? Could we just get a cold beer all up in this? Thanks! The server then got him a new one, which was cold. The Circle Wheat was good/refreshing however was a little too sour for my liking. 
Scene: It was a really beautiful day in Madison and we were really enjoying the patio that is covered with vines and nice and cool in the shade. The patio is where it is at and with good friends, the mediocre good can be overlooked.Thought this place was average... certainly didn't live up to the hype.

We were there on a Thurs night so maybe that's what was up. Still, other places we went that night were jumping and had good parties going.

We weren't intending on coming here but we were dragged by 6 or so 40+ ladies who were a lot of fun and seemed intent on having their fill of us mid20s english chaps. We played along and got in free with them. Bonus. 

The crowd seemed a little lacklustre, there was no line to speak of, and the drinks seemed expensive for what you got.

That said, the music was right on and the actual place is very nice to look at, if not a little small.

I'll be recommending other places in Vegas before this...As I previously mentioned in my review for XS, I'm cantankerous. I don't like crowds anymore and I don't really care about being seen at the most crackinest club but I'm not going to no wack place either. For me, Pure was right in the middle. I was there on a Tuesday night, "industry/local night" which was just the right amount of crowd for me. The music was pretty good. There was no line but maybe because it was a Tuesday. Free admission because it was part of my hotel package. It's always nice going to club located in the hotel that you're staying in, you can go up to your room and rest your feet, drink more, freshen up your hairspray, check on your false eyelashes, fit in a quickie, etc. I didn't really get to explore the whole place, just danced downstairs and upstairs, which was my favorite part.Pure at Caesar's Palace

I went there a year ago on my friends bachelor party and we rolled in about 9 or 10 guys. We were put on the guest list the night before so we didn't have to wait in line, thank god. They even had people outside the casino inviting people into the club with free passes.
The good thing about the club is it looks beautiful. Outside the club you had the pussycat dolls gambling area with go go dancers which was nice. There was even a pussycat doll lounge next door. 

The bad things about this club is that it is way I mean way too crowded. It was almost impossible to get a drink. To try and dance was even harder on the main dance floor since you don't have any room you just try to jump up and down. 

Luckly there is also rooftop dancing and lounge. The music is very different though. The main floor with hiphop and great djs. The roof with techno and a less happening crowd. 

Alot of cabanas upstairs. 
Action, alot of girls were uptight so it was hard to start a conversation. I would think it would be easier since most people are on vacation but I guess its one of those you gotta have money to be in a cabana or bottle service kinda thing. lol

Finally conclusion. We didn't like the huge crowds.Great for big groups! The food is well massively produced, somewhat bland, but try the 3 tier taster. It has different sausages. But mainly go for the beer!I lived in Germany for 6 years, and I love my German food. I know the owners put a lot of effort into the place, but I just can't dig it.

Hofbrauhaus Vegas is a great place to celebrate a birthday raucously. The Jaeger girls will gladly spank birthday boys, and the band usually makes the bachelorettes and birthday girls enjoy a special Alpenhorn (the things from the Ricola commercials) concert up close and personal. If you're up for fun and things that are supposed to be slightly embarrassing, this is the place. Just don't expect to have a conversation - the place echoes like the dickens.

The interior is a good replica of the original, but without the spurs of years of smoke and habitation. There walls are a warm color, and there's German-style painting near and on the ceiling. The stage plays host to German bands on the weekends. It's not unusual to see a few German couples dancing the Disco Fox to "Living Next Door to Alice" or "Ein Bett im Kornfeld." The band plays a mix of German and English pop, so don't be scared off by a few German titles.

The "beer garden" area doesn't echo as much, and it's a much more relaxed atmosphere. It's not actually outside, though, which is slightly disappointing.

Usually, the food is excellent, but at my most recent meal, the red cabbage, my favorite German food, was spicy, as if someone had added Siracha. I couldn't even eat it. Sad panda! The potato pancakes with salmon were excellent, and the salmon was fresh and sushi-quality.

There's valet parking, but most folks usually park across the street at Walgreens. Between the parking, the noise, and now the spicy red cabbage, I'd recommend other places.If you are staying on the strip, it's kind of a pain to come out here. We took a cab on a Saturday afternoon and I was expecting it to be very lively but it was very mild. It was half filled and no one seemed to be in the spirit. Mainly couples and some groups of guys. The beer was so good though. The food was so rich nobody in our party felt good after wards. I honestly would have just been happy splitting one of their delicious pretzels.I am not sold.....yet.

We came here for lunch on a Saturday before hitting Fashion Square to do Christmas shopping. We figured that we'd need the energy to battle the crowds at the mall and that we could walk off the caloric intake of this meal.

There was quite a crowd when we arrived, and we waited for about 20 minutes for a table...not so bad, but it was sort of annoying to have to wait outside with the scenic view of the strip mall parking lot since there was really no room to stand inside.

Neither my husband or I were blown away by the food. The atmosphere is really neat, and for some reason I was incredibly intrigued by the fact that the restrooms' sinks are outside of the restrooms themselves.....what a quirky but neat set up. Random that I noticed, I know.

The food was mediocre, but the service was good. Our waiter was attentive and got everything to us correctly and in a timely manner. However, the food wasn't anything special in my opinion. If the fries weren't served in whimsical grocery carts, I doubt they'd really impress you, but that's just a guess.

I also didn't love the fact that I could overhear the conversations on both sides of me. Not that it wasn't entertaining to hear a gentleman try to explain to his table why it was more intelligent to withdraw large sums of money from an ATM that charges fees because it effectively decreases the interest rate. I 100% agreed with his logic but did not need to hear the explanation 42 times. On the other side of us was a curious couple that appeared to be on a date, which was worrisome in itself since it could have been a father/daughter combo. However, I highly doubt that fathers ask their daughters generic "tell me about yourself" questions.

Anyway, the main point is that I am not sold on Delux. I'd like to go back to see if my opinion changes. I like the atmosphere, and I like the service. I just don't know if I agree with the prices - I'd call it overpriced I think. So if you'd like to treat me in an attempt to change my mind, be my guest.Sometimes I love delux, sometimes I don't. The greatest variable usually being the service which is incredibly inconsistent. The staff  needs to learn you can be hip without being pretentious. (A seemingly difficult task, but obviously an art that has been mastered by many Phoenix proprietors.)

 If the service was as up to snuff as the food, I would definitely have to bump up a star or two....I want to give a better rating, especially since the bathroom is awesome & always super clean and smells like home-baked goods, but service is just too crucial to overlook!The sample bar is a very good idea - props to Chino Bandido for their creativity and marketing strategies.  Still, I think this place, while kitschy, is not worth driving 15 miles out of your way to experience. If you happen to be in the area, choose it over Taco Bell or Panda Express any day. But don't take a date here. Take friends from out of town who want to experience the "real" Phoenix - I'd say fusing anything with Mexican food is just about as Phoenix as it gets.  

PS, I went next door to Poppa Maize after lunch. The owner has been going to Chino Bandido for nine years and never knew that you can get the Jade Chicken without the breading. Not like she'd have to worry about it, but I do, so there you go. :)OVERATED buffet!.  I saw the reviews, so I decided to check it out.. I was kind of dissapointed.  I felt there wasnt much of a variety of selections.  it seem most of the buffet consists of beef and crab legs.  I have to say I liked the chilean bass, vegetable chow mein.  kobe beef didnt taste good and the crab legs were salty.  I have to say this buffet has the best dessert though.  I find Rio buffet much better, especially in variety .The price of this buffet is a lot more appealing than some of the other buffets, but while you leave somewhat satisfied... the food doesn't knock off your socks.

I came here for brunch and was looking forward to the variety. Sadly, the food had me wondering what the hype was all about, and it's kind of a shame because I like what PH has done with the rest of the place...

The labels were pretty useful, I'll give them that. Everything was just really so-so, and even fun things like seafood were disappointing. The better section was probably the Mexican food. They have all the staples, but just fall really on the mediocre side in terms of quality.

The cotton candy is a lot of fun, so are the different desserts, but I wouldn't run back here for that.

Since going to Vegas is usually a vacation of some sort, I always figure I might as well budget a buffet like Rio or Paris. To eat here again, I'd need it paid for or super discounted. 

Bottomline: Move along... nothing much to see here.After seeing Ka, a little underwhelmed.  Was it one of the first Cirques?

I would look for the cheapest tickets.  Every seat in every Cirque show is good, so don't spend too much on this one.  It's good, but it's not KA.We go to Madison about once a month for various Badger sporting events. Sometimes we do double-headers and have to find somewhere to kill some time between the two events. 

Let me put in here that I was a little disappointed by Yelp Madison - the top 10 reviews are for bakeries and coffee houses, making it difficult to find what locals think is a great place to eat. 

Anyway, we ended up choosing the Old Fashioned a few days in advance, so I spent some time looking at the menu online and was really looking forward to trying some of their food. 

Because of the timing of the events, we got there about 4:30. The place was still pretty busy considering it was pre-dinner time. It's a good thing we got there at that time, since it was absolutely stuffed to the gills by the time we left at 6. 

Despite having like 140 beers, they carry just one hard cider, which I think is a little ridiculous. But I ordered it. It wasn't very good. 

So I perused the giant beer menu and went for an apple New Glarus I'd had elsewhere and loved. They were out of it. And before I could even go back to the menu, the waitress let me know they were out of 2 other fruit beers. However, the waitress suggested a beer on special that, based on the name, I'd never had tried, but it was quite good. So good on her for knowing the flavor profiles of what they had available. 

Since it was early, I was still pretty stuffed from lunch and the meals there all looked huge. I knew from Yelp that the fried cheese curds were a must and I couldn't imagine how I'd handle a whole meal, so I decided to piece on together. 

I ordered the curds for us to share, then ordered a side of the dill potato salad and a bowl of the beer cheese soup. 

The curds were as advertised - spectacular. But everything else was a disappointment. 

The beer cheese soup is clearly made with sharp cheddar - it had that good, sharp bite. But it was also incredibly gritty because hard cheese like that doesn't melt well. You could see the gritty pieces all over the spoon. It was just an unpleasant texture.

Also, because it was so sharp, it was kind of a lot - if you know what I mean. It needed some bread or a pretzel or .... something to break up the strong flavor. It came with a small packet of oyster crackers, but those just soaked up the soup and didn't accomplish anything. 

And the dill potato salad didn't taste anything like dill. It was ok, but not great, but I as someone who loves dill, I was really looking forward to it so the lack of flavor really disappointed me. 

So I think the food was probably pretty ok, but after reading the menu I was really looking forward to these things and they failed to meet my expectations. 

The boyfriend, incidentally, had the Saturday night Prime Rib special and it was delicious. He ordered the "small" and the plate was huge, with a giant mound of onion strings, which I don't think he even touched, plus a baked potato and the Prime Rib. The Prime Rib was melt-in-your-mouth. 

I wish my meal had lived up to the promise of one bite of his. 

We were in the room off to the left of the hostess station and there is a long bar there. As the restaurant got more and more crowded, so did the bar and there just wasn't room for all those people. Folks were bumping into the back of the BFs chair and the servers couldn't even get through.Not really a huge fan of clubs, but when in Vegas...

Pros:

The place is huge and there are a bunch of different rooms so you can always find somewhere that plays your music of choice. There are a number of different bars, but they still tend to have pretty long lines. I really like the lounge area, it's a great place to stop for a quick drink before heading out on the town. 

Cons:

Tao is always considerably more crowded than any other club in Vegas. It's impossible to move around inside of the club, so moving to and from the bar is a pain. The line to get in can be ridiculous if you don't plan ahead and get on the VIP list. 

Overall Tao is always fun, but I definitely prefer the clubs inside the Wynn.I had a good time at Tao; fun to dance on the stage with the dancers.  We were there early and from what I gather, the time you go definitely has an affect on your experience.  We got our free drinks around 11 (got in for free by getting stamped at dinner) and we got to avoid the lines too.  They played fun music, but i do have to agree that once it starts getting packed and you're forced down to the dance floor, the whole experience got a lot less enjoyable.  I understand that clubs make a ton of money through table service, but there is no reason to compromise the breathing ability of your dancing patrons. Once on the dance floor, I was smush dancing, because that's what you end up doing with such a tiny floor and no where to move.  We stayed for a couple of hours and left...it was fun and I would go back...I just wish that I didn't have to wear heels.Fast, delicous, and a nice ending to a great day!Am I not remembering this place correctly? The view was spectacular from the outside patio, the drinks were delicious and moderately priced for Vegas, and the bartenders were cute. 

But the music, oh the music. Nelly videos don't really seem "high-end club" appropriate. The decor is so beautiful and so zen, and the music is about Bentleys and hos. The juxtaposition is more jarring than welcomed. 

The crowd was also very, very strange. There seemed to be a bar crawl of foreigners who's idea of hitting on a girl was to tell her that she's tall. Before that were a group of middle aged couples getting freaky to Missy Elliot on the dance floor. It's an interesting time and worth the visit if you don't have to pay a cover.Ate breakfast here on our way out of town. Chose it out of convenience at we were staying at THE Hotel. Was told wait was 15 minutes or immediate seating at the "high bar tables only". We opted for the bar, but at least half the restaurant was empty and the regular tables in the same section were completely empty (the high tables are very uncomfortable for me to sit at because of back problems and also for the husband who is very tall).

The server was very prompt and friendly and brought coffee right away. However, we did wait about 25 minutes for our food.

The food was tasty, but my omelet had a wrong ingredient in it and I was brought toast with no jelly or butter. My husband said the corned beef hash was better at Red, White and Blue (also in MB hotel), and his poached eggs were not really poached at all (not runny but solid).

We were on a time crunch so we didn't have my order corrected and I borrowed jelly from the table next to me.

For Vegas, the prices are pretty reasonable. I will probably try another place next time.I am not a huge fan of Vietnamese sandwiches... or really sandwiches in general.  But I love the egg rolls here.  You can get a whole box of them for like $20 and they are really tasty so its a great thing to pick up for a party.  Way better than the frozen kind and just as cheap.Lasagna entree - $15
Bottle of meritage - $32
Tiramasu - $6
Smelling cigar smoke, hearing a car alarm, and listening to somebody with whooping cough - Priceless

Where's the half-star when you really need it?! Veneto is stuck in the middle, between 3 and 4. So, do I round up or round down? Such a tough decision. I can't rate this 5 like other people, for I did not think the food was 5-star worthy. However, based on other factors, the rating of this place deserves more than 3 stars... yet doesn't quite reach 4. Allow me to explain. 

Atmosphere is 2-star worthy. Sure, sitting on their patio, tucked in the corner, makes for an intimate time with your date. Unless, of course, a car alarm goes off or you have to deal with a person coughing one of those rib-rattling coughs. You know the kind. Not to mention, people standing outside the "Veneto patio perimeter" to talk loudly on their cell phones. However, inside the patio, patrons were respectable. The occasional loud, inebriated table does not a bad experience make. 

Price deserves 5 stars. With two entrees and a fantastic dessert, price came to $45. That's pretty great for two people. Throw in a bottle of wine, though, and you're looking at an $80 tab, before tip, which means you're really looking at a $100 tab (atleast), for service definitely deserves a generous gratutity!

Service definitely deserves 5 stars. Our waiter was top-notch. Very conversational, friendly, professional and attentive. He recommended a bottle of wine that would suit both a meat-focused entree (lasagna), as well as a fish dish. The wine - lyreth meritage from Sonoma - was smooth, silky and a perfect dance partner to both our dishes. 

Dessert deserves 4 stars. Never before had my date seen Tiramasu served with two sauces on top. It's almost like the piece itself was divided into two tiny countries. One sauce was chocolate. The other was espresso-based. I could have just had spoonfuls of the latter and been quite content. However, the tiramasu was heavenly. 

Decor deserves a 3, I think. Especially since the music they played didn't match the intimate and unique dining experience they offer here. It was too pop-ish and loud, even from sitting outside. When my date and I excused ourselves to the lavatories, we noticed semi-guady decor, high-back booths, rich creams and rubies throwing themselves against the walls. It wasn't a stomach-turning touch. Just a bit over done. A simple, clean layout would have done wonders for this place. Not to mention maybe a more subtle bar - without a blaringly bright TV set. 

Food deserves 3 stars. It doesn't deserve any more than that. At least not the entrees we had. My date had the special, which came with mussels, crab meat, salmon, etc. in a pasta bowl with a damn fine light and flavorful sauce. I ordered the lasagna, which was a generous portion. Upon first bite, I couldn't place the taste. I had had it before! Given some time, I realized why I felt like this lasagna could be a new comfort food. It reminded me of when I was 8 and my mom would make me Chef Boyardee ravioli. The meat sauce of this lasagna tasted just like the ravioli sauce I used to love as a child. But, let's face it, I didn't go to Veneto to satisfy my 8-year-old self. I came to impress my adult self and enjoy a lovely night out with a wonderful man. My date even said later that it did, in fact, taste like the canned ravioli. He just didn't want to say anything at dinner for concern of insulting me or the lasagna. (Poor lasagna...)

Having eaten at Veneto this past weekend, I sit here and reflect upon the place. While there, I definitely thought this was a 4 star place. Now, however, I can't convince myself that I would ever go back. And I reserve 4 and 5 stars for places that hook me, that become places I crave, places I want to experience again and again... as well as places that leave a lasting impression. To me, Veneto's lasting impression expired Saturday at the stroke of midnight.

Over all, I think Veneto is a great place to dine. Don't get me wrong. This place is a hidden gem, for the service, the price and the overall experience make this place worthwhile. Just don't expect an "Oh My God" moment from your food... or expect to dine in peace from the noise of street traffic, car alarms and awful music.It was good but I thought it would be better not allot of flavor in the dishes they all looked nice but I think I would of been just as happy at a Dell Taco the overall 4 star is a bit too high in my opinionWent for lunch and still cant get over the fact that this pizza place does not serve pizza during lunch!! 

My sandwich Ai Formaggi (see pics) was good but it wasn't anything that wowed me, I wasn't craving it later, I didn't dream about it, in fact it's like it never even happened. 

I still cant help bit wonder how the pizza is though, but since they don't serve it during lunch I guess I'll never know.The first time I had dinner at FEZ it was a wonderful meal. My friend and I sat on the patio, enjoyed one of their cocktails and then had some delicious food. That time they deserved 4 stars. My second visit wasn't as enjoyable. I stopped by to get a burger during lunch and decided to get it to-go. The burger was cold, they had just thrown some shredded cheese on it and not even bothered to melt it, the patty was not what I am used to getting when I pay 9 dollars for a burger, in fact, imagine a hash brown from mcdonalds that was made with ground beef instead of potatoes but that had the same cardboard like taste. This was probably one of those items I wouldn't order again. The service the first time was great, the second time since I ordered to go so I can't comment on it.The jerk chicken wings are pretty great. The buffalo wings I could pass on.

I got the French Onion burger, which was good but a bit too salty and onion-y... surprise surprise. It tasted like it was seasoned with a pack of onion soup mix.

Boyfriend got the Hawaiian burger which he really enjoyed. I liked picking the little bits of mango off his plate.

Fries were good enough and the margaritas were a bit weak but tasted good.

Staff was all super nice including our waitress who was happy to recommend all kind of things for us and the girls by the door who offered to take a picture of us with the token big breasted mermaid.Cute restaurant.  The guacamole is good and freshly made but not the most flavorful, it was missing some more lime or some chili or something.  I felt the same way about all their food, good, but missing just a little extra oomph.  Items are not smothered in cheese which made me super happy.  Not your typical Mexican food, the food was lighter and I was happy to note that it wasn't overly salted.  I will still be back to try it again, but it'll have to be a day were I want some subdued flavors.  Think of it is the yin to Los Dos Molina's yang.They got rid of my favorite breakfast sandwich!!  The bacon/egg/cheese croissant thingy was heavenly.  Super bummed.I don't know why this is so famous
Design is pretty but taste is nothing specialI wanted to take my mom to a nice buffet, so I was deciding whether to go to the buffet at the Bellagio or the Wynn. I yelped both places and the Wynn seemed liked the winner. We get there, and the line was long, wrapping around in a loop as if you were in an amusement park. (Tip: Get there early.) Good thing, I had cool people in the line with me to talk to which made the line and the time go by faster. 

I went there on a Saturday night, so I believe the prices are bumped up over the weekends. Expect to pay $41 per person. No senior discounts, since my mom qualified. Boo! Was it worth it? Ummm... I'm a vegetarian, so NO. But this dinner was not for me, it was for my mama. My mom liked it and she would go back if the prices were reasonable. 

The setup was all right. I guess you can say it was setup more like a cafeteria style, where you get in line and wait for people to get their food. There were a variety of cuisines to choose from. So food-wise, there was a lot! Okay, so now to the desserts. I was excited when I saw that they make fresh crepes. I had the chef make me one, and I was not satisfied. It was horrible. I sampled pretty much all their desserts, and most were too dry or just didn't hit my palette the right way. Even though they had a wide selection of desserts, the only thing I liked was the coconut ice cream, the crème brule, and one cheesecake. 

I like to try new things, so I'll try the buffet over at the Bellagio next time I'm in town.Everything's bigger in Vegas. But not necessarily better. 

While I loved the quantity of selection (redundant?) at the Wynn buffet (5 kinds of ceviche? Hell, yeah!) the quality was another thing. 

Aforementioned ceviche was great flavor-wise but did not have much actual seafood (I know, I know, they have to have filler but only getting two tiny pieces of tuna in 2 scoops of ceviche is just not right). The salmon and sea bass were quite dry and that strange artichoke dish was just bizarre. All of the pasta dishes were bland.

The good: chicken noodle soup made with real chicken stock, tender sliced beef with to-die for jus, amazing mashed potatoes (maybe I'm just easily impressed by butter), green beans, guacamole and the white chocolate crunchy cake. We got one of every dessert and that was by far the best. Runner up would be the orange tapioca. Sad, sad selection of puny slices of only 3 kinds of fruit, though. 

If you want to give the buffet a try (and you do because everyone says you should), I'd definitely advise going for lunch. Comparable experience to dinner but less pricey so you don't feel completely ripped off.Beautiful dinning room, delicious desserts.I was looking so forward to eating here and it was good but I'm not sure worth the $135 plus tip I paid for 2 adults and 1 child. I mean the food was great buffet food but still a buffet. it wasn't fresh, the was a lot of dry food from sitting for awhile, the sushi was just OK and I had to wait for drink refills for a long time when it was not busy, but most of all  the condiments came in packets, everything else was very good but the I dressed up and had to open soy from a packet for my sushi and it squirted all over my shirt. for what I paid I think there could be soy at the table or at least at the sushi station.Its a buffet and I shouldn't expect more. While the selection was good I'm still not impressed. Only went again this second time because this is where my boss wanted to go while he was in town. Next time I'll try to steer him in a different direction.Really great choice of food and I am sure that every taste is covered. If you get a chance try the buttermilk pancakes. 
Only 3 stars because of really slow and poor service.We do enjoy Tex Tubbs Taco Palace. Ambiance is kind of cool. The ingress and egress at the entrance is unwieldy. When it's packed, there's no room to get to the restrooms or to the salsa bar, or even around the bar. There's no place for waiting people, to wait. On a Friday night after 6 p.m., we were seated right away. After we arrived, it got really packed. For an appetizer, we got the chips and guacamole. It was $6.99, which seemed pricey to me. But it was delicious. Salsa "bar" has only 4 salsas, and is hard to maneuver when there's more than one person at it. Salsa containers are tiny, so you have to negotiate the crowd to get back to it, and hope you don't spill your salsa on the way back to your table. "Flight" of 3 frozen margaritas for $7 is a bargain and very delicous. Hit the spot! I had the crispy Tilapia tacos, and my partner had the Green Chicken Chili. Both were delicious, but both of us thought they were dry. I had to put a lot of salsa on mine to make it not so dry. Otherwise, it was awesome. Our server, Jennifer, was a delight. She does the baking, and that particular day was National Mango Day, so she had baked Mango Margarita Cupcakes. We took one home, and my partner devoured it. It was awesome. Cupcakes were $3 a piece. It took a long time to get our food, but I attributed that to how busy it was. And we were happy eating chips and guacamole from our window seats. We had planned to use a gift card, and Jennifer kindly added chips and salsa to our take-out order so we got to our gift card total (can't use that particular gift cert to include with the tip). All in all, a great experience. Only downside was the dryness of the entrees.I had a good dinner here on Friday night - unfortunately poor service and inconsistencies knocked it down a star.

I started off with the Beef Carpaccio - tasty, but only slightly better than average. It was a little skimpy on the truffle oil and a bit heavy handed on the capers - not the balance that I was looking for.

The Scallops "Benedict" was truly spectacular if you are an eggs benedict fan.  A little crispy potato cake topped with crunchy bacon, a perfectly seared scallop, crab hollandaise, and chives - now I know why everyone keeps taking pictures of their food!! Hard to describe how awesome this was - but take my word if you are a breakfast fan that this was YUM!

I also ordered a side of lobster mashed potatoes (a yumdelicious combination of 2 of my favorite foods) and "Adult" mac 'n cheese that failed to deliver. It was more like a weird fried mozzarella stick .... not sure what they were going for but it was definitely the lowpoint of the meal.

My husband had the 20oz ribeye and it was cooked and seasoned well, but nothing spectacular - 

My friend had the Seabass and her risotto was completely undercooked - we had to send it back. Instead of attempting another risotto, they offered up a substitution - which I think was pretty weak. If you're not confident that you can get the risotto right on the second try then take it off the menu!

Overall, a good meal with friends but with so many amazing restaurants in Vegas, this won't be my first choice for a return visit ....The food was just okay...  there was nothing spectacular about it.  Our table ordered pot stickers, hot and sour soup, beef with bitter melon, assorted BBQ, and chicken chow mein.

It reminded me of PF Changs (which I don't really like).  The decor was odd... for the most part it was very sleek and modern... then they had wicker chairs.   I thought it would be more expensive since it was in the Wynn... but it was still pricey for what it was.  For example  the $9 hot and sour soup ended up being an appetizer for one.  (We thought it was going to be family style).I've been here several times, and I try to stick with the Dim Sum, as I've learned that it's the least mediocre food that they seem to offer.  They try to be authentic with their menu, which, it sure looks like it, but I think they've toned down some of the flavors for... I don't know... There's a shit ton of Asians that go through the Wynn, why they wouldn't try catering to that palette is beyond me. They must have white people as Chefs.

The service is iffy, and there's usually a wait to get in.

The restaurant interior is really pretty, though... I like Red, and wood, apparently.Visited for lunch for the very first time.  The employees were friendly and greeted us kindly.  The atmosphere is trendy for the younger crowd, pretty cool inside design.  A full sushi counter w/ a full long bar.  Had the chicken teriyaki combination - it was good, but next time would like to visit at night and see the night culture here w/ some sashi and sushi.  It might be fun!I've seen productions in other cities, but I was roundly mocked when I suggested this one might be similar. And so I caved in, and attended. We had the poncho seats, and I'm disappointed that I came away completely dry.

So how do you express the feeling of watching a blue man show? If you've seen one already, it'd be a lie to say the shows are the same. The jokes and gags are different, the music is different, and the theme is different. And yet, somewhere, the undercurrent, the percussion heavy setting, some of the audience interaction, is all the same. Don't get me wrong, if you've never seen one before, you should bump up my rating by 1.5 stars. But if you have, I really don't know that going again will be anything new.

It also makes a huge difference how willingly the audience plays along and responds. I feel like in New York and Chicago, for instance, the crowd knows exactly what they're getting into, whereas here, confusion rather than childlike glee seemed to be the prevailing emotion. Not to give anything away, but they have an act that involves passing along reams of TP, and by the time that's done, your hands are tired and you don't want to participate anymore, and you just want that act to end. And some of the jokes took too long to set up, so that when the punch line came, you were like 'eh'.

But, but, there's also so much good about the group. These guys are supremely talented, great with their cues, and musically talented as hell. In spite of everything I've just mentioned above, I did have a good time. The drumming is awesome, all the colors in the painting are great, and I'm fairly confident they had no plants in the audience (always a plus in my book). So if you're a blue man virgin, go.Came here with my cousin during EDC weekend for a late lunch/early dinner. We hit happy hour-- score! 

I was starving so I may have went overboard ordering.

We shared (even though most dishes were mine) California Roll, Seared Tuna, RA'kin Shrimp, Viva Las Vegas Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Crunchy Calamari Roll, and Spicy Salmon Roll.

Seared Tuna was excellent- nicely sliced and great melt-in-your-mouth texture. My cousin and I kept dipping blander rolls with this sauce... 

RA'kin Shrimp was my favorite here! Panko-crusted HUGE pieces of juicy shrimp on a bed of greens with a tasty dipping sauce. If I ever come here for happy hour again, I'm gonna order 3 of these and be done with it!

Viva Las Vegas Roll had a thinly sliced and fried lotus root on each piece but the cream cheese was so overpowering. Why do we need cream cheese on everything? Ugh. This was alright, but I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese on my rolls to begin with...

Shrimp Tempura Roll... meh. Not crunchy at all. Soft and cold shrimp tempura with way too much rice. And it's not even good quality rice.

Crunchy Calamari Roll was alright. Kind of same as the shrimp tempura roll, but this time, you hardly taste calamari and only the cream cheese. Again with the cream cheese! 

Spicy Salmon Roll was ok. Chopped up bits of salmon with a nice kick. The rice kind of ruined it, in my opinion.

Overall, great happy hour prices and my cousin and I loved the seared tuna and RA'kin Shrimp. This chain is more Americanized sushi, but on the strip, we can't complain too much. 

At least we were beyond full and ready to party for EDC later that night!After having read the reviews on Yelp, I was extremely excited to go to Alex and indulge in fine dining. I mean, you are after all in Vegas! 

Price: $165 for a 3 course
Meal Options:  3 or 5 course fixed meal only
Wine: Extensive Wine List (A+)
Dress: Sophisticated

I'm sad to say though that my experience wasn't as good as some others in this forum. I have mixed feelings since some points were positive while others weren't so much. My boyfriend and I came here dressed up (suit and cocktail dress). The dinning room did look grand and sophisticated. It made me feeling like I'm in ballroom. I love the colors. The only thing I wasn't super fond of was the flowers all over curtains. I'm assuming they are fake flowers, not dried up flowers. It made the curtains look very tacky. I think the curtains by themselves would have done justice to the room as is. 

We weren't given an option to sit in the patio, but since it was cold, I didn't mind sitting indoors. Since I was indecisive about making a selection with what wine to go with, the waiter was kind enough to allow me to sample between two. It made a huge difference because the one I originally wanted to go with, I end up not liking it as much. After we picked our pre-fixed selections, we were given a sampler, courtesy of the chief.  It was yummy and very kind of them. But I later noticed that everyone in the room got one courtesy of the chief so it didn't really feel that special anymore. But that's okay, I was still very happy with it. The scallop soup was my boyfriend's favorite. I liked them all though because they were all so different. Just a note, I think this sampler isn't always the same. Another yelper had something else.

1st Course: Appetizer

The oysters were beautifully placed on a huge bed of salt. It was delicious.
The lobster was slightly over cooked and my boyfriend wasn't too happy about that. He feels that for what you're paying, everything should be perfect. There should be no oversight.

2nd Course: Main Course
The Rabbit and Veal were delicious. At this point of the evening, Alex came out and greeted every party individually. That was really cool to see the chef.

3rd Course: Dessert
Wow is the best word to describe it. We had a lot of dessert. Alex was kind enough to give us a platter of different types of dessert aside from what we ordered. The Madelines were really good and soft. It was warm, like it was just out of the oven. We ordered the Malted Chocolate and Banana Napoleon and it was okay. The Roasted Pineapple Basque with Vanilla Crisps and Coconut Sorbet was really good and I do recommend that.

At the time of reservation, I did let the operator know that my boyfriend and I were celebrating our anniversary. At the end of our meal, they gave us a dessert with a little cracker saying "Happy Anniversary". That was very sweet of them. 

A Yelper mentioned that they received macarons when they left Alex. I got the same thing so I was super excited to try it. I'm sad to say, but it just wasn't good. I've had macarons at different places before and it just doesn't even come close to comparing. I do like the variety, but it was dry. I let my expert Macaron friend try it too, and she said it wasn't good either.

Overall, I have mixed reviews of this restaurant. It was good, but it wasn't great. Like another yelper said, "it was good, but not memorable". I think if the food was more consistent, I would give it a higher rating. The service was terrific and I did really enjoy the ambiance. I especially liked that they had a little chair for my bag. That was very classy. My boyfriend said he had better fine dining experiences at another restaurant which costs about the same. As a result, I'm giving it 3 and 1/2 stars. I guess I have high expectations of Alex, but who wouldn't for fine dining?Sad to say this, as the meal I had here was very disappointing. The prixe fixe meal was forgettable. I guess I came on a bad day? The food was just ok, nothing really spectacular. I had expected to be wowed, but it didn't even come close. 

So 3 stars for the excellent service and decent desserts.I must say - really nice atmosphere for this place being open 24 hours. :) The late night menu was ok - I had a turkey club, hubby had a burger...

I should have went with the burger. The club was ok... I've had better.

The service was pretty good, though. 4 stars for that... :)Located inside Wynn. We sat at a table by the window which had a view of the pool. 

SLOWW service here. It wasn't even busy. We waited long to have our order taken, waited long for our food, and waited long for our check.

Food was ok. 

Chicken and waffles: Chicken is boneless, breaded, and fried. It was a little bland though. Waffles are well-seasoned and tasted "interesting." I really wanna try the chicken and waffles at Bouchon at Venetian but I tried twice and was unsuccessful. One time they were sold out and another time the wait was too long.

Crab and shrimp salad was very yummy and had a lot of seafood in it. Pricey but that's expected.Stayed at this hotel for business. The hotel is ok. Its clean and I like that it doesnt smell like smoke, like the other hotel/casino's. Plus since my company paid for the hotel, it made it even better. 

The bathroom was clean, sheets were soft, bed was pretty comfy, and there was a lil kitchen area. There is a gym below the lobby which is free. I didn't get a chance to look at the pool. 

Its pretty decent but I still prefer Platinum Hotel and Spa.Stayed here for a short weekend b/c we got a really good deal. Overall the hotel is pretty nice - each room has a frig, microwave, mini bar area and a basic set-up. There's nothing fancy or special about this hotel, but if you don't want to pay those resort fees and you're sick of the smell of smoke from the casino floors, this might be a good option for you. It also seemed a lot more "family friendly" for those reasons too. The pool area is pretty big and they have a couple hot tubs too and a bar outside. They also have a nice fitness room and a lounge area where you can sit on comfy couches and watch TV or play pool, ping pong or fuse-ball.

It is located on the strip, about an $6 ride to encore just to give you an idea. I prefer to be closer to the other casinos on the strip, but again, this was a short trip in which we weren't planning on spending too much time on the strip. 

HUGE HUGE HUGE CON: 10am checkout. This is simply outrageous to me. Every other hotel is either 11am or 12pm, how on earth can you expect ppl in vegas to check out at 10? Even if you're there with a family, it's just way too early and they were def NOT accommodating to my late check out request. Unless I find another too good to pass up deal here, I won't be returning.A nice little hotel in the middle of giants on the strip. Rooms new and nicely equipped. Not what you expect in Las Vegas...I went with two good friends who were pegged to sit though a timeshare presentation at the location.  We all sat through the long presentation and started watching our clocks.  We actually started getting annoyed because there were many drinks to be had and we were missing out!  

Other than that, the hotel was nice.  The pool area was very cute.  It had a good looking bar and it was decent in size.  If you are looking for a more adult pool, however, this isn't the one.  It is at the very end of the strip, literally the last hotel headed towards downtown.  For that reason alone, I will never stay there again unless it is absolutely free with no catch.  That would be my only major complaint.I'm really surprised by all the negative reviews on the Monte Carlo cafe. Although it can't be beat by Grand Luxe Cafe at the Venetian, this is still a decent cafe option with reasonable/affordable prices.

If you're looking for something on the budget, Cafe gets the job done for breakfast options or simple sandwiches, salads, soups, & burgers.

The bill came to $25 for two people for lunch, for two sandwiches that we shared. Both also came with sides (either cole slaw or fries)The food is not the issue here. Food choice was huge and it was pretty good. Lots of choices. What was horrible was the customer service. It was unbelievably bad. First me and my friends waited in line for about 45 minutes. There was a group ahead of us that had 25 people in there party and only one person working the register. The manager comes out and decides to let everyone in line, who was not a guest at the hotel, go in front of the line and they were seated right away. They then made a separate line for non-hotel guests and they were seated right away as well. Everyone else in my line, the ones staying at the Rio, had a look of bewilderment on there faces. 

We finally get to the front of the line to pay. After we finish paying that is when they decide to add a second cashier. Really? You barely add a second cashier now. What a way to make the guests of the hotel feel important. 

If and when they improve there customer service I would suggest eating here. But for now I say go somewhere else. It is Vegas and there are plenty of other buffets to choose from.We ordered the saag paneer, malai kofta and naan. The food was quite good and the naan just melt in your mouth.  The decor is pretty nice too. Service was attentive. The food was reasonably priced.

The only reason I did not give this place a 4 star is because they didn't have air conditioning on and it was a hot and humid Las Vegas evening.3rd stop on our buffet of buffets journey. Best selection so far with lots of variety, not your standard buffet fare. I had shu Mai, bananas foster, banana pudding, corned beef hash, and fried plantain. It was all pretty decent. 

The downside was the service. We had to wait 20 minutes for our drinks (soda and water). I hate eating without having a drink to cleanse my palate.My first In-n-Out experience.  Was around midnight this past Saturday.  Drive-thru was pretty busy so I was very excited anticipating my de-virginization (is that a word?)!!  Anyway, since I had done my Yelp research I knew what I wanted to order:  Cheeseburger, Animal-style Fries and Dr. Pepper.  When I arrived at order box, the male voice asked me if I wanted ketchup or extra "spread"....

Well, honestly, I cannot understand why its "all that"!  Perhaps if its something you grew up eating, you connect the food to a memory?  And since I didn't grow up eating In-N-Out...no connection for me.  (Kinda how I feel about certain 80's bands - they may not be the best musically but I connect them to a time or place and it makes them better - at least in my own mind.)  Anyway - sorry for diverting here to music from food.  

I mean, it was edible and not greasy but, well, not spectacular food.  the pickles on burger were pretty good.  The animal fries were ok, not like anything I'd had...have never put thousand island dressing on french fries before.  However, adding that to cheese and pan-fried/browned onions wasn't too bad.  I can see stopping for the animal fries again, after a few drinks....We are in Vegas. We expect a bit more. It's normal right? Everything in Vegas is done in grand and sophistication. We wonder what's wrong with this place because it's so small. Nothing really stands out in the place.

I think I'd give this place a better rating if they don't pretend to be a private lounge in the middle of the casino. It's just a bar with about 6 or 7 tables. 

The host was trying to persuade us into buying a table with $300 worth of drinks but we refused. He let us have the table anyway because it was not packed that night. How nice of him.Went there to drink... I hardly pregamed and I paid for it... I spent roughly $70 on beer and liquor.. one bill of 2 beers and 3 shots was 23... so not horrible but geeeeez im broke. lolA great place to go after the clubs, and when you need soup to help you recover from a night of to much drinking.  
I don't know to much about authentic Chinese food, but this place is ok. 

The dim sum was pretty good.
The porridge is perfect  as a hangover soup. Its yummmy!.
I like the beef Szechwan noodles and rice dish.

Its a good place to eat at when your looking for a quick bite to eat, especially since it's located right next to the the rooms. 

The only downside, the service sucks ass. The waiters are unfriendly.
Its kinda pricey.I don't know how they can substantiate their absorbent pricing for their Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup but I certainly fell for their ploy. Considering I am already on the strip, I didn't want to venture to Spring Mountain Road for noodles so this was literally the closest restaurant. The beef noodle soup was decent, but at $14 before tax is a complete rip off.

It looks like they have a good variety of Asian food, but in order to satisfy your cravings, you would have to pay a premium to indulge.We waited until the last minute to get in to a restaurant on a Friday night around 9 pm.  Shibayu and Craftsteak were packed so we headed to Fiamma.  It started off well.  The wine was good, the bread was yummy and our insalata was good.  That was where the good dining experience ended.  Our waitress disappeared forever, the people who were seated after us were served food long before we ever saw our waitress.  When the food came, it was obvious it had been reheated since someone forgot to bring it out to us.  

I wasn't impressed by the food at all.  It was ok but nothing to write home about.Checked out Le Cafe for breakfast one morning in Vegas. My brother tells me he can't go to Vegas without going to Le Cafe and having corned beef. Apparently a lot of people feel this way because there was actually a line to get in. I wonder if these people thought they were in line for the buffet? No buffet for me in the morning; my hungover ass wants my food brought TO me.

The menu was pretty standard breakfast fare for a diner. I have the eggs Benedict and they were pretty tasty. My plate was garnished with a pretty purple orchid, which was a cute touch. When you order coffee, they give you the entire carafe, which I think is great! Then they don't do that half-cup refill that you get at other places with totally throws off your ratio of coffee-to-milk-to-sugar and messes you up all day. The hash browns were the best part of my meal. But please, oh, please tell me why my breakfast cost $26 for two eggs, two muffins, two slices of ham, some sauce, hash browns, and coffee? Diner food for $26? Only in Vegas.A long wait just like any other Denny's i've been too. an even longer wait to get your food too. portions are decent, enough to fill you up. I got some scramble thing they sound really good at that moment after a night out of getting F--ked up at TAO nightclub. 

A lot of people come here to eat and its actually a pretty small dennys, sadly. also, people, no alcohol is allowed here [ my buddies didnt get the memo since we all walked in with a cup filled with something ]. our server betty i believe was really nice. she was awesome with the service, that made up for the wait time for our food.The nitrogen cocktail was really phenomenal. I really love the tapas style and sharing food with everyone at the table. My favorite dishes were the steak tartare and the new York steak. The croquet monsieur was pretty yummy too. The fish dish was nothing special. The pork schnitzel was blah. The cocktail menu includes various kinds of Absinthe, very interesting.I enjoyed the food, but it was nothing spectacular to be honest.  Everything was good, not great.  The service was just so-so.  It took a long time for someone to come to our table, and when we were not ready to order, it took even longer for the waiter to come back the second time.  I guess I expect much more when you're paying that much for dinner.  
We opted to try 5 different appetizers/tapas and as i said above, they were good, but not great.  
I was really hoping to have a particular dessert that someone told me I had to try, but it was taken off the menu the day before - figures.
With all of the great restaurants that Vegas has to offer, I would likley skip this place next time.  Unless the service gets much better and the plates become more memorable, it's just an overprice restaurant.Late night dim sum totally hit the spot. The options are a little limited, but the food was good. We had the shu mai, crystal shrimp dumplings, and stuffed crab claw. The shu mai and dumplings were good, but I wouldn't suggest the crab claw. The stuffing was dry and the crab was overcooked. All in all, it was a great post-club snack and pretty inexpensive.Love Tammie Coe cakes, they are always so beautifully decorated and taste amazing. 

I bet you're asking yourself "Sasha..if you love this place so much why the 3 stars???"

Well let me tell you, even though these cakes are both yummy and beautiful, they are ridiculously overpriced (yes, I still buy two for company parties... but I digress...). Also, this location is almost ALWAYS closed, my suggestion is to get your little butt over to La Grande Orange Grocery since they sell them there as well. 

Be sure to grab a brownie or oatmeal cookie if you don't feel like putting a hole in your wallet to get a cake :)The "woody Allen" is A monster of a sandwich with 2 thin slices of bread and 5 inches of meat. There us no way you can eat this with your bare hands without meat falling. I wouldn't say the meat was extremely amazing. The waiter said the sandwich is the one most people order. I assume it's because people have an inner desire to consume the monstrous sandwich. I wasn't able to finish half without feeling overwhelmed with the mountain of meat I had before me.

Even though the sandwich was ok, the mustard sauce that came with it was amazing. It really added the kick I wanted. It made the sandwich that much better. 

I had to chow down on some of the meat first to make the meal enjoyable. Make sure to use the wrapper to eat it. Don't bother trying to pick up the sandwich as is. It will fall apart on you, guarantee.Went to the Carnegie twice during our stay at the Mirage. Went in for "dessert" one night. Ordered the cherry cheesecake. The cheesecake was pretty good, but it would have been better if they'd poured fresh cherry pie filling on top when ordered. Unfortunately, it was like a fruit rollup.  Returned for breakfast (it's hard, but not impossible, to screw up breakfast). Eggs, bacon, potatoes & toast - all good. Wait staff seems bothered to have to serve you. They avoid eye contact so it's hard to get a refill on coffee or water.Had the fried rice, spring rolls, and crispy stirred fried flat rice noodle.  I wouldn't say this place is a 4.5 stars but food were decent and fast.  Good service.  Price ranges from 7 to $10 for the entres.I first off have to say I love Chipotle! Good food, pretty decent price, for the new age fast food market (fast food that isn't a burger). Their chicken is my fave and their guac and chips are the best in town I think. 

However, I for the first time today took what seemed to be the advantage of ordering online. My office all wanted lunch from there and the line can be pretty ridiculous at noon, so I figured I would pre order then just walk in pay and be on my happy way. Not so much. I will say that the ordering process is great, very easy and fast, took just a few minutes then hit send. But when I got there is when the annoyances started. Our food was not ready on time. I made a point to watch the person that walked in right after us and see how quickly they got out of the building, they won, we were still trying to pay for our order. It was seemingly very unorganized. The girl at the register kind of pointed us in a direction where someone would come out from the kitchen to give us our order, we were not allowed to pay or fill drinks while we were waiting, and it was to difficult to ask any questions that we were too frustrated to ask for extra salsa. 

On top of that while we were waiting the lady that was making our food came out in the middle of prep to talk to another customer about franchise opportunities and how much their building rent was. **Note to the jerk off that thought it would be a god idea to pull the manager out of the kitchen to discuss business at noon on a Monday: HELLO!? Are you serious? Time and place buddy, time and place. Call Corp for these silly questions. Arg! 

Anyway, the food is good, but they really need to get a better handle on their service. A bit of a cluster f*** if you know what I mean. I am a huge fan of ordering online and getting things fast, but I do not recommend using these opportunities at Chipotle.Been there a few times and the food is always quite good. The service leaves a little to want at times but overall the place is good. The chili dogs are to die for as are the hot rocks.The feeling overall is nice. I like how you can get "fancy" food, minus the stuffy atmosphere. You can definitely tell this place is most frequented by the guests of the hotel because they walk in wearing casual clothing and there were tons of families with young children.  I also thought the service was excellent: 5 stars. So why did I give this place 3 stars? Frankly, the food is not worth what they charge. And their cocktails leave something to be desired.

The braised short ribs were probably my favorite dish of the night. The blue nose snapper had a nice crisp sear to it, but it was pretty bland.

For dessert, we had a milk chocolate and candied orange velvet cake. I had some reservations because I don't enjoy strong orange flavored sweets, but it was surprisingly delicious. I liked how it reminded me of a Ferrero Rocher with a subtle orange flavor.

I'd like to come back and try the afternoon tea. But for fine dining, I'd rather go elsewhere.The Manhattan Express roller coaster is over-priced and over-rated. The roller coaster isn't particularly memorable although you might remember that you spent more than $10 on your ride, that you saw a great view of the strip, and that several signs told you not to ride the roller coaster if you were drunk or pregnant (way worse if you were both drunk and pregnant!). I'm surprised there is a line for this fairly mediocre roller coaster experience...Oh.  My.  Goodness.

When one of my breakfast companions said, "I'll have a Dutch Baby," I was nonplussed.  What the &^%%$* was a Dutch Baby?  So I asked for one too.

It's a huge fried-cake thing and my GOSH it was good!   So was the service (very attentive with the coffee, bringing extra napkins, etc.). They were also very nice about us sitting forever and chatting.

On the down side:  whatever you do, sit at a table, not a booth.  We were offered a booth, and the upholstery had the consistency of a -- well -- a PANCAKE.  Imagine sitting in a bucket of soft foam rubber, with the table up to your chin.  So we asked for a table instead, and they cheerfully moved us.  

I'm torn.  The food was four stars, definitely, but the booth was too much of an adventure.  Three stars.  (Something like that always makes me wonder uneasily what else is worn out or neglected.)

A solid A-OK for those pancakes, though.  Now I'm curious about the apple pancakes!Came here 2 times over labor day weekend.  Both times we went late.  First time service was great, 2nd time we where almost kicked out by the bar attendant.  He was extremely angry that the girl let us in, he said he "wasen't allowed" to take anyone after 1am.  First of all, HELLO arent we in Vegas where a lot of people eat late after a nigh of drinking?  I remember before these cafes used to be open 24/7, and now they're "union" so they get to close (HATE unions). 
Enerways, in my drunken state I ordered the club sandwich both times.  I is VERY big, with plenty of meat, only ate half, the fries where very tasty. 
It seemed a lil pricey, but hey, in vegas anything goes right??We came here after the Cher concert and we were HUNGRY!  We decided to order a couple of appetizers and we went for the Chicken Quesadilla and the Spinach and Artichoke Dip.  When they brought out the food I thought there was a mistake because the Quesadilla was the SMALLEST thing I have ever seen in my life.  It looked more like a taco...for $12.00.  The dip was good but it is served with garlic bread and not chips...so you are left with extra dip and nothing to dip in it.  Chips would have been better.  We got the creme brulee for dessert and it was tiny as well.  Overall, it was pretty pricey for such small portions.

On the plus side the cafe is really cute and I loved the ambiance of this place.  We also received really good service and that's why I'm giving this place three stars instead of two!My family decided to come here for breakfast after hearing about their $6 breakfast special which is a huge deal after facing all the expensive tourist prices in Vegas. The special came with hash browns, eggs(of your choice), toast(you pick the bread), your choice of ham, bacon, or sausage, coffee, and a slice of pineapple(for the Hawaiian themed restaurant). The plates looked very presentable, the staff were friendly, and the coffee was good.....but the food not so much. I got scrambled eggs that tasted like straight up butter and was very undercooked. I gave my piece of ham to my mom since I'm not a meat person in the morning. The hash browns weren't the best but it was tolerable and the toast was well...toast. I ended up eating everything on my plate because I was hungry, but that ended up being a poor choice. About 30 minutes after eating I got the worst stomachache of my life. It was horrible and I could barely walk without complaining about how nauseous I felt. Eventually I sucked up the pain, but it didn't go away until about 6 hours later when I decided I could stomach a granola bar. I told my family I would not be going back there again only to be called "picky" and "stubborn" because apparently they all loved their breakfast special. 
So 2 days later we return for breakfast. They all order the special and I get a plate of pancakes for $7 which ended up being a bit pricey because a coffee was $2.50 extra. My plate came with 3 giant pancakes, a little container with syrup and a little container with butter. While it was no iHop pancake, it was still very good and I even had to give one to my cousin because the pancakes were so big. 
Cheeseburger is a decent place for breakfast if you're in the Miracle Mile Mall area.When I think of Ticoz, I only think of the restaurant section to the left of the main entrance. I'm not a huge fan of their lunch and dinner menu but I do love their appetizers.  Trio of dipping sauces and Nachos Montana are my faves! Good friend, Melissa & I, who also happens to be my running & training chica boo, always throw in a Happy Hour date here so we can enjoy our fave appetizers while playing catch up. This place never disappoints for Happy Hour. Cheers!The funny name of the restaurant was what drew me to it, it's Shabbat and I didn't want to spend money but I had to get something in my stomach, so I opted for their vegetable fried rice. The lunch entrees on the menu were fairly expensive, fried rice alone was $6.95 plus $2 for a soda, but it is an airport. Well the woman there brought out chicken fried rice and I told her it was wrong, got my veggie fried rice and sat down. Big bowl, with ???'s in it, and fried rice with onion and sprouts, and some deep fried rangoons of sorts, mmm some of the best fried rice I've ever had! I am guessing the chicken fried rice would have been even better.. Plus they have wifiThis is a great spot for the Red Rock, probably the best place within the food court area.

Fatburger is a legendary So Cal burger staple, with Ice Cube rappin' about it ("...Two in the mornin' got the Fatburger") on his hit "It was a Good Day" 

I prefer it over In and Out, Five Guys, Johnny Rockets, The Counter, The Habit and most other over the counter non-fast food, cooked to order burger joints.

In LA, I usually get the Fatburger on the char grill and fat fries (as opposed to on the greasy grill with skinny fries)

In Vegas, I opted for another of my favorites, the Bacon and Egg sandwich.  It's really good, but tell 'em to skip the mayo and put on ketchup instead, it'll taste better.

I've not gone to LBS which is a sit-down burger restaurant in the Red Rock, so can't compare this to that.

With Fatburger... The prices are good, it stays open late, what more can you ask for?I went on a Wednesay with a collegue visitng from India that was craving hojmetown food.  Little selection and way to salty.  Some dishes were tasy and I appreciate the all-veginess, but was dissapointed.Could be so much better!It is a little cramped at that long, wooden, communal table, inside, but the nice young miss next to me completely ignored our brushing elbows while we semi-audibly chattered away to our separate parties.  

Our waitress was slightly off, bringing us several wrong items, a couple of times, but she just as quickly whisked them away.

Prices on the somewhat limited menu are relatively affordable (a rather tasty $15 bleu cheese and steak dish topped the list), turnover seems as quick as you want it to be.  

Definitely the best place in town to experience complete strangers suffer through their totally awkward first and last date, before your very eyes!

Supposedly infamous sangria, which, nevertheless, we did not try.  
More friendly to your smaller manual wheelchairs than to your SUV electrics.This restaurant has a lovely ambiance and excellent service.  The food is delicious and the offerings are innovative.  My only wish is to have had at least 2 additional offerings for each cuisine type.  There were not enough choices offered from each kitchen to truly get excited about.Great Italian place for the price.  I had their BiGRiG pasta bowl with wheat rigatoni, the consistency of the pasta and flavor of the sauce were pretty good but I still had to flavor it up with spice and herbs, not what I was expecting for something that says it was supposedly to be spicy.  I ordered a side sausage and must say it was the highlight of the entree, perfectly crisp outside and superb flavor.

A good place if in the area for Italian food but I wouldn't say somewhere that one would go out of their way for, chain restaraunts usually aren't.Sauce was good, pasta was ok. For such a swank place it didn't deliver what I expected.See if we can get our money worth. Lol.  I tried the prime rib which just can't go wrong with, but aside from that...it was just another buffet.  just ok.$40 for the best seafood buffet in town!

if you're hitting the rio buffet during peak hours (weekends for dinner between 5:00pm - 8:00pm), make sure to be ready to stand in line.  We waited once for 1.5 hours to get into this buffet, and yes it was worth it.  Another time, we went in on Friday at 4:30pm and walked straight in.  

the buffet is divided into the following sections/regional flavors of seafood:
asian - chinese
asian - sushi
hispanic
american

the buffet also includes a great prime rib, massive assortment of dessert, and a gelato/ice cream/sorbet station.  the gelato/ice cream/sorbet station boasts a cooler that automatically spins to your selection.  GREAT.  make sure to ask for a good sized portion, otherwise you'll be given half of what your plastic bowl can handle

avoid the raw bar....not top shelf

the crab legs are the exception and are great!

the sushi selection isn't to die for, but is a step up from grocery store quality

remember to properly pace yourself!  if you do, you will easily be able to enjoy 4+ plates :)I didn't realize it's $40 per person, so I got a bit of sticker shock. I still can't decide if it was worth it or not. 

They had delicious crab legs, oysters, lobster mac n cheese, mini lobster tails, sushi, lobster bisque, Mexican dishes, etc. The dessert was pretty limited, that was kind of disappointing. The only thing I enjoyed was the tiramisu. 

The major thing that ruined it for us (hence the 3 stars) was the terrible layout. This was SO poorly designed. Buffet etiquette dictates that if you want something, you walk up to the item and take it. You don't stand behind 30 people who are all waiting for something waaaaay down the line because every station is connected.

The raw bar slowed everything down to a crawl. Firstly, learn how to serve yourselves quickly, people. It was unreal how many people would pick and choose each little morsel of food or stand around gawking at everything...it's a buffet for god's sake, slap it on the f*cking plate and move on jerk. 

I waited for almost 20 minutes just to get a few pieces of sushi at the end and again for 10 minutes just to reach the lobster mac n cheese, which was halfway to the raw bar.I keep forgetting to Yelp about this place! Maybe that's a sign, though it wasn't awful. Another book club stop. It's pretty small, hence the "cafe". Very loud too, not the best place to hold a book club meeting. The food was very good, I had a veggie bleu cheese pita sandwich, which was very tasty, once they remembered that I ordered it. I would love to do one of their tasting nights, looks like a good deal and you can try several things on the menu at once. Also want to try their desserts- looked very yummy!alright..alright...the market street cafe at the california hotel is probably one of the best local and Hawaiian secrets here in las vegas.  for one thing there are hella Hawaiians in this place.  the cafe is your basic vegas 24 hour cafe.  it serves the typical steak and eggs, omelets, chicken finger, and house salad dishes...blah.  everybody here in vegas comes to eat here for the oxtail soup.  fricking hella good.  you can't get this anytime.  you have to wait till after 11pm to get this dish.  so i imagine this  stew with chunks of meaty oxtail, carrots, peanuts, and mushrooms simmering all day long till it gets served in a huge soup bowl with a couple scoops of rice on the side.   when you get this dish drop a couple of spoons of rice into the soup.  Then, pick your fork at the oxtail, the tender juicy meat just falls off so easily off the bone and plops back in the stew.  you then take the meat and dip it in this little dish filled with ginger and cilantro, but i take it to another level and squeeze some lemons onto the ginger with some Tabasco sauce to give it reggie's extra zing!!!!  this meal is totally cheap, and probably one of the best comfort food after a night of heavy drinking.  be warned, everybody around here knows about the oxtail soup.  when you get to the cafe around midnight, you'll notice a long line snaking out of the restaurant.  when you walk into the cafe, at each table you'll see at least one person with a bowl of oxtail soup.  YES....it's that good....The food is good but not great.  I prefer this as a happy hour place and no so much as a dinner place.  The bread is delicious and hot.  The calamari is reliable.  The food in general is reliable but I don't view this as a destination place.Who says size doesn't matter?  Well for this traditional farm food with a twist establishment, size totally matters! The portions are huge and fairly priced! I have been here a couple of times and mostly had breakfast items that were good.  The wife ordered a waffle with a side of sage fried chicken.  The fried chicken was tender and very good.  The sage was very complimentary. If you are in Vegas for the weekend skip the breakfast buffet and make your way here for a pleasant experience.This is a high 3 stars, not quite enough to hit 4.  If I happened to be in LV again and someone suggested going here, I'd happily say yes, but I'm not going to be dreaming of it or talking reverently about it like some of my friends.

I was very pleased at being able to get a table immediately on a Sunday at lunch time.  The menu, while not huge, had a lot of interesting possibilities (especially if you eat meat and/or eggs).  I decided on the apple cinnamon pancake - that's right, singular.  One pancake was the size of a serving platter.  It did have a good amount of cinnamon, and thin green apple slices cooked in all over it, which I liked better than the pie filling apples you sometimes get on top of apple pancakes.  My friend had the vegetarian hash; I only tried some of the potatoes and tomatoes, it was okay but not stunning.  Service was fine, price was reasonable.  The restroom was kinda cute in a way I can't explain.This dining experience had both good and bad elements.

First the good...the view!  We were seated at revolving window overlooking Las Vegas and the mountains.  What an awesome way to enjoy dinner.  We happened to be dining as the sun was setting, and it was simply gorgeous.  Our waiter was helpful and pleasant, and he made our experience enjoyable.  Another plus was the Baby Frisée Salad with Maytag Blue Cheese and Bacon Lardons.  Sooo fresh and delicious.  After beginning with this salad, I was really looking forward to dinner!

But alas, dinner was the bad part.  I ordered the Seared Organic Salmon with Lemon Grass Beurre Blanc.  Wow, was that salmon strong tasting, and also smelled strongly of fish (isn't that a sign that the fish isn't fresh??).  We also ordered some mashed potatoes to share, and they had developed a crust on top like they were sitting under a heat lamp for a couple of hours.  YUK.  So disappointing.  Also, I wasn't impressed with the cleanliness of the place.  It actually smelled kind of moldy.  Not something I like in a restaurant.Visit: 9/26/09 - Lunch.  Buffet.

The buffet was good.  The sushi was made fresh and the hot items were turned over well.

Service was okay for buffet.

Price was good because it was lunch time.

I will go back.Fits the bbq needs but is not worth the prices for a family. $2.50 for a non-refillable soda when the food is on the overpriced side was a little much. We'll stick to coming here on out birthday when you get $10 off. That makes it about right.Burgers were super thick and tasty, but they use shredded lettuce and that's not so great on a burger. The fries are amazing! Seasoned and delicious. My bro and I finished off burgers with the Fried Twinkie which was actually pretty good. It's not a grease bomb like you'd think.

They have country music videos playing all the time and when Toby Kieth's "I Love This Bar" comes on everyone gets free shots poured directly in the mouth from a chick walking on the bar. Bras hanging above the bar keep the place extra classy.

The food's good, but I don't think the burger and fries are worth the $13-14 I paid. That's my only complaint. I do believe I'll return with friends so we can eat, drink and dance. Seemed like there was enough space by the video screen for some country dancin' and west coast swing.So I paid $12 for a sub-par turkey wrap, a cup of clam chowder, and a small drink. I ended up here because the buffet line across the hall was too damn long and my friends and I were hungry. The turkey wrap was kinda small, with basically just lettuce, turkey, and I guess some bacon bits. The cup of clam chowder was typical decent clam chowder, but I'm a fan of clam chowder in general so I liked it. I honestly think all their stuff is overpriced, but it does the job. I'd take my business elsewhere though.Nothing special and a bit out of the way, prob should lower the price a bit.
However the ride is short, fast and sweet.Been here twice during my recent trip to Phoenix.

The first time was when I first arrived.  Hung out here while my roomie and I were waiting for the other parties to arrive.  The long wait was making me moody.  Thanks to my roomie's quick thinking...we headed here for lunch and drinks.  *Hi, everyone!  I love yoooooou!*

The second time was when we were all flying back home.  Lunch was alright.  My chicken sandwich was dry.  The waitservice could have been improved or teamed up.  It was the total opposite from the first visit.  A classic Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde twilight zone or something like that!

Chili's Too...at an airport....should have thought ahead about luggages.  It's a challenge to come in with your luggage and trying to navigate around other people's luggages in the aisles to your table.  Otherwise, it's just chaotic.

Looks like Chili's Too at an airport is only good for drinks.  Stick with that...and only if you have a carry-on.  Otherwise, if you have 20 luggages...move on!  The customers and staff will thank you!Located in The Mirage..Cravings is about 26 a person. 

Pretty big, and they have their dessert bar, salad section, Greek section, Chinese section, sushi, noodles, raw food, Latin, Breakfast, Italian, and the omelet man. 

I like how majority of the sections have somebody that can make it for you. Noodle section had a lady who can make you your noodles. Salad bar area had a lady who tossed it for me...........no dirty-ness. 

The Chinese food was not good at all. Got the fried rice, bok choy, noodles, and egg roll...did not like any of it. 

They had a good variety for the Latin section most definitely.You's aiight.

If you're looking for something really low key in Vegas, this place will suffice.

Of course drinks are still expensive as F, but it is still Vegas after all.

Kind of awkward because you have bottle service, a tiny ass dance floor with most of the people just standing around awkwardly staring at the dance floor wondering, "what do I do now?"

In order: pre-party in the room, have A drink (yes, just one) in the lounge and then peace the heck out of there for something way more fun.this will be a different type of review because it started off a little weird but ended up being better.

We went on Wednsday night for dinner, a group of 6 of us.  We showed up for our reservation and were seated right away.  The menu's came out along with water and the waiter came by asking us for drinks.  i ordered a Rum and Coke and his dickhead response was "I'd imagine Bacardi is ok....", i told him to surprise me even though i was a bit irritated.  He asked if we were getting appetizers to split and we said yes and picked up the "Antipasto Della CASA" which had amazing cheeses and meats, the "Fritto Misto" which was the best Calamari i ever tasted, and he suggested the famous Meatballs (which again, the best i ever had).  After the appetizer order, he took our menus which seemed a bit off but we didn't think much of it since we were having a good time.  After we ate the appetizers he came back over and asked if everything was good and if we needed anything else.  He was SHOCKED when we said we had been waiting to order more drinks and dinner.  His attitude completely changed and then he was all over our table being the nicest guy ever.  

The food was really good, i got the "Chicken Scarpariello" which was amazing, but seemed a little small and mostly peppers in the bowl, i wish it had a bit more sausage.  The veal chop was amazing too, i'm glad i was able to try my friends. 

Overall it turned into a good night was lots of food and drinks, i just wish the our waiter wouldn't have irked me the wrong way right off the bat!The mixed drink were to lemony all three of them I tried, order wine safer bet.  Food was ahhhmazing!!  Service terrible we had to flag down our waiter to even order. Flag for a second drink twice. Flag down again for pepper and knives for our salads since they them  with appetizer plates, etc.etc.Took the wife to n9ne for a birthday dinner. Pretty nice atmosphere. Service was good except for our actual server who barely came to check on us after we ordered. Everyone else was very good. Wife loved the lamb chops. I had a Cajun rib eye. Pretty good but not the end of the world, which considering the price of things is not what I expected. I've had much better steaks at a much lower price. Overall I enjoyed it but way too expensive for what it is. I don't want to say we'll never go back but it won't be anytime soon.This place is right across the street  Kenny Guinn J.H. I went to Kenny Guinn years ago and this place got there after I left. But I went there and it was pretty good considering they have drive thru! Imagine that a drive thru for Thai food. Pretty convenient. Service was ok, but they could pay a litte more attention to detail in food.Great place if it was in a regular hotel, but THEhotel should have something better.  

After a night of heavy partying the wife and I stumbled in the next morning with bad hangovers.  The place was empty except for one other table.  Our initial greet was prompt, but service was really lacking from that point on.  The food reminds me of eating at Denny's or Cocos.  The muffins were stale and the fruit far from being ripe.  

If you are staying at THEhotel and are looking for a quick breakfast so you can get back to bed and sleep off your hangover, give this place a chance.  But if you have the time and energy, I would go someplace else.I know this is supposedly the best pizza in Vegas, but I guess I'm not a huge fan of it...

First off, the service here is wonderful. They are all very attentive and friendly, checking to make sure everything is to your liking. The wait can be long but they'll give you water as you're waiting. There's always the option to sit at the bar too and get some appetizer before a table opens up.

The menu has a decent selection of pizzas and they usually have a special pizza of the day. You can get pizzas with or without tomato sauce. The pizzas I have tried are the Diavola, the Vico, and one of their specials of the day but I can't remember too much about it. 

Diavola - It has a very nice little kick from the crushed red peppers and the salame gives a good saltiness.

Vico - The mascarpone pretty much melted and mixed with the olive oil and was a great substitute for having no crushed tomatoes. I was skeptical about no tomatoes but was pleasantly surprised. I also really liked the fennel and wood oven sausage, even though I generally am not a fan of sausage.

So why the 3 stars? I'm not a huge fan of their crust. It's a bit too wet and thin for me. This is one of those very thin pizzas where it's probably easier to eat with a fork and knife. For me, I like a crust that can hold its weight and has a nice crunch. Theirs is nice and doughy, which I do like, but it doesn't have that solid crust I really like in a pizza. Their toppings are great and all work well together, but there is very little.. I know this is supposed to be how traditional pizzas are, but I guess my poor student budget doesn't agree with it too much.  

This isn't the best pizza in my eyes, but everyone has different tastes. It is undeniably good in terms of quality of toppings, but it just doesn't have the amount I would like. And that crust, it leaves me wanting more crunch!Just Average...waiter and staff friendly, atmosphere okay, the food was not as good as other steakhouses off the strip.  My son had 8 oz filet, don't think it was really filet. My husband had Steak Diane which he said was average.  They both normally like sweet mashed potatoes, but other than a taste or so, did not eat them.  The bread was tasteless.  Most restaurants we have to try to control ourselves from eating too much bread, not here.  We'll cross this casino off our list.There are so many options for day drinking in Old Town. We hadn't been to Loco Patron in about 6 years so we stopped in with a couple friends from out of town. It happened to be happy hour (sweet!) so we went with a couple rounds of margaritas for the guys and skinny margaritas for us ladies at $5 each. The salty-sweet combination hit the spot and they offer unlimited baskets of tortilla chips with salsa. Our server was nice about getting them for us too. Even though we were only doing drinks she didn't give us any attitude, and checked on us frequently. 
Other than that I kind of agree with Lindsey that it's just kind of "ok". Nothing spectacular in the decor. The rowdier crowd was at the bar and the quieter side was at the tables and booths. It didn't reallly seem like a "fun" place to be, but I guess when you're with your friends it's fun anyways. 
Oh, and yes, props for staying power too.I truly wanted to love Guy Savoy.  Okay, I loved the service.  Very attentive, professional, yet very friendly.  The decor is among the most drab I've ever seen.  Steel grey walls--felt very institutional.  Tables are very well spaced.  Loved my view of the Eiffel Tower from the Paris Hotel.  Very nice that I received a printed menu in a lovely folder.  Food, however, was "okay"--not memorable.  Nothing wrong with any of the dishes (okay, the chicken was a bit dry), but for a dinner that cost more than $600 for a single person, I wanted to be "blown away" by it, and I wasn't.  The room throughout the evening (Thursday night) remained no more than 1/3 full. (Two nights before I dined at Joel Robuchon, and almost all of the tables were taken).  I had the Menu Prestige.  For the money, I will return to Joel Robuchon.A bit out of the way, but that can be nice (super convenient for the airport). I think the most annoying thing about this place is the ridiculous speed bumps. They are killer for a low lying car, as most expensive sports cars are. Not nice to kill your guests' cars!!  The shuttle was not the least bit convenient with very vague timings and sometimes will only be dropping people off and will not take pick people up (happened to us from both harrahs and the resort itself). Because they are always running marketing packages, you end up getting herded like cattle in the shuttles. Not a fun experience for a 'luxury' resort.  The 'activities' can be a bit of a joke as well. They had muffins and coffee in the lobby one morning and they were pathetic even for free food. Mini Sara lee muffins from a box are not all that luxurious.

We stayed in tower 3, which was not as nice as what we saw in tower 1, even though they claimed this was newly renovated.  The room was big and clean and little things made me feel like they paid attention to detail (including a mattress pad for the fold out couch).  There were two tvs, a stereo, and a DVD player and a view of the airport for one's entertainment needs.  But the room was extremely loud and the construction quality cheap. The appliances were generally good, but the oven was outdated.  Anything that runs water (shower, ice maker, washer) is sure to keep you up. The shower had the most pathetic water pressure, which was weird because the tap would fill the tub in seconds. Maybe it's supposed to be a rain-like feature, but we were not fans.

I suppose I shouldn't complain, having paid about $50 a night for this place - but I was hoping for more from this vacation giant.Nice and clean and a really good selection of items. This place isn't so much a "thrift" store because of the prices being a little high for used stuff, but nonetheless it's not bad. If you're looking for higher end stuff and don't want to go to a consignment shop then this is the place.Pretty expensive compared to Ghandi's just down the street.  Food was fine, but not wonderful.  A bit nicer ambience than most Indian placesI'm not sure how to review a place where we did all of the cooking ourselves. The service was friendly and prompt.

We had the seafood combo with a kobe chuck add-on. There wasn't as much seafood in the seafood combo as we had hoped. The fish, vegetables and meat all looked and smelled fresh. the borth they give you for shabu shabu seemed fine.

What else is there to say about a place where you cook your own food?Another Va Bene Cafe (at the Cosmopolitan) equivalent. 

Nestled in a comfy location along the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian, this cute little coffee bean branch boasts really good coffee. I ordered a hot hazlenut latte coupled with a tuna sandwich, and also got my friend a swedish berry iced tea. They were all a wonderful burst of flavor and the coffee did a great job waking my groggy self up (I was book burying earlier during the day) 

My only problem was how those 3 items added up to nearly $18! Soon enough, I found out that my coffee was a startling $5 and the tuna sandwich was another $3-4.  I immediately remembered how I had to pay the same amount of money at the cosmo for a comparatively smaller cup of coffee and a muffin. Deja Vu, per say? It's still the strip afterall and picking that location to hang out after an art gallery event at the Wyland Galleries meant that I shoud've known what was to be expected of the pricin g, let alone the fact that we were at the Venetian. 

So I'm scratching the whole pricing issue and focusing on the positive instead- their coffee! Quality was better than starbucks and our barrista was pleasant. Seating was a little cramped but lucky enough there weren't a lot of people lounging there at the time so we had ample free space and privacy to talk. It was a refreshing night and if I do stop by the venetian for another event in the future, I may consider coming back here.i don't really remember this place...

went from playboy to moon.. then back.

one of the bartenders has some pretty dope ass tattoos.After seeing Top Chef I really wanted to check out this sandwich place. Because I love the show so much I was hoping to write a great review but this is not the case for me. Perhaps my expectations of how the sandwich was going to taste was too high.

I ordered the pull pork sandwich and it wasn't anything special.  I was expecting a bbq flavor but not even that and the pork itself to me was too salty. 

I think it is over hyped and a bit over priced but so is pretty much everything in Vegas.  It is an okay quick bite for sandwich place but that is about it.  

Luckily I had a Mandalay gift card and I used it to purchase my sandwich.  The sandwiches didn't live up to my expectations and will not be coming here again unless I happen to be in MGM and had to grab a quick bite...if that is the case I'll try a different sandwich.  Perhaps I might change my mind about this place.A generous 3 Stars...It's a Tale of Two Konas far too often for my liking.  

There are some specialty rolls (Volcano, Bama, & Sunshine Rolls) and entrees (Macadamian Nut Chicken & Miso Sea Bass) that I have really enjoyed at Kona...But far too often the food is flat. 


The service is real nice and friendly, but often staffed for inefficiency rather than customer service.

The thing that gets me the most is that everyone raves about their Happy Hour...but literally none of the food or drinks make me want to come back.  Not a fan of the tacos/HH sushi rolls/mini burgers...the funny thing is there are multiple places in Boca Park that doo all these items better!  The Happy Hour drinks are cheap...and taste like they are cheap!

The restaurant is usually dead apart from the weekends because everyone is out on the patio trying up their pretentiousness status...I would rate Kona with 1 Star if I rating the crowd and atmosphere attracted to their patio.Very good food, somewhat limited menu, service sometimes good sometimes slow, can be very noisy unless you sit in the back, somewhat pricey, parking can be difficult.When I lived in Las Vegas, this was the place for my favorite Crab Fried Rice.  The atmosphere is authentic Thai, dark, and quiet.  Serving size is adequate and good for take out.  

The food here is comparable to Lotus of Siam:  the typical Pad Thai, Panang Curry, and etc.  The prices are getting more and more expensive though.  Plenty of parking for dining in or picking up take-out.

The experience at Pin Kaow is a very traditional authentic style of Thai restaurant.This is a fun little place to grab a drink with friends and people watch. This is similar to a beach bar. The place is open and airy. It is not intimate dining or upscale dining but it looks like a place to grab a "snack". 
Also, you can try to "win" a lobster for $2 in the lobster claw machine...if you are successful (you won't be) they will prepare it for you! I love this...I tried! I had a pretty good Cosmopolitan and my husband had a few beers at the bar. I would go back!This used furniture store is like walking into a garage sale that spreads over several acres.  It is gigantic - and fascinating.  They have everything from cheap dressers to monstrous ornately carved book shelves that would barely fit in a mansion.   It is an ongoing show, changing as old furniture is sold, and new shipments are brought in.  I have seen everything from cheaply made $5 night stands to bed frames that run into the tens of thousands.

Like a garage sale, there are no salesman - you just kind of wander around and look at all of the furniture.  This has it's plus and minuses - there is no high pressure, but if you have any questions, you have to go out of your way to find someone.

I haven't bought anything, but I have spent several hours wandering around looking at everything.  The first time I went they just didn't have anything that I was interested in.  But I do go back when I am in the area, just to look at what new pieces have been brought in, as I know at some point, they will have something I want.We would probably give this place 3.5 stars, so 3 stars is rounding it down. The food was good (especially for sushi in Phoenix). The menu has a lot to offer, and what we had was pretty fresh. Our servers were also very friendly.

Our main issues are: 1. The food was somewhat overpriced. They had a few items that were inexpensive ($5 items, and the California rolls are just $5). Some of the rolls were way too expensive though, and the tempura was also pretty pricey. 2. We were there in a group - some of our food came out extremely fast, and some came out very slowly. It made it a bit awkward when we finally had to eat because our food was going to get cold.

All in all, we would return, but at those prices, we would probably wait until we are really craving sushi. It is definitely one of the better sushi places we have eaten at in Phoenix though.We had a Groupon for this place that we just couldn't seem to get around to using. I suppose it was because the place was nearly an hour from our house. Anyway, I really wanted to love it. But here's what happened:

Things I loved:
When we couldn't get a reservation the last week of the Groupon the owner offered to extend the date so we could use it; They have a GORGEOUS patio - with live music; service was very good; portions were generous: amazing mashed potatoes and cornbread casserole.

Things I didn't:
The prices - they are steep; the complexity of the food. Now this last requires elaboration. I was reminded of a TV show (this actually sounds harsher than it is) that Gordon Ramsey does. In one episode a very nice French restaurant was having trouble and he explained to them that their dishes were too complex and it hurt the flavor. He suggested they simplify, which I believe they did, and to good result. This was my experience. The dishes I loved were simple and absolutely delicious.

But our entrees were not and they suffered for it. For example, my ribeye had cajun seasoning, then it had a roasted vegetable medly on top, then it had melted blue cheese over the seasoned meat and vegis. Too many flavors. And not one wowed because they all got lost in each other. Same with Jim W's chicken. It had panko breading and tomatillo cream sauce. But it also had goat cheese, crumbled bacon, pico de gallo and tortilla pieces. It sounds delicious but when I tried it the flavors were muddled and confused.  

I hate to say it, but I would have been happier elsewhere. I'm going with 3.5 stars. I'm going to keep an eye on their menu. Maybe I'll give them another try.Jillian's is pretty much the only place in the hunk of junk known as Neonopolis to ever have anyone in it, and it's easy to see why.  Its appeal is pretty universal.  It's a restaurant, giant arcade, bowling alley, bar, music venue and dance club all rolled in to one - however, everything in one place doesn't always mean it's awesome.  I've had some good times at Jillian's, but if I'm hanging out downtown it's not my top choice of places to go.

I ate here once with my ex-husband, and although he left the bad taste in my mouth, the food was pretty good.  It's your typical, American, Apostrophe S restaurant cuisine.  The arcade is fun, but it's no measure to Dave and Buster's (why don't we have one of THOSE?  jeez!).  The bowling is fun, that's for sure.  It's a little more expensive than other alternatives like Sam's Town or the Gold Coast, but they have groovy balls and blacklit lanes all the time and I'm a nerd for things like that.  Also, my friend Ryan fell asleep on one of the bowling benches and they let him sleep there.  (I guess that's a plus if it's a tired friend, not so much if it's one of the transient population of downtown.)  The bar is a bit pricey and doesn't have much in the way of pizazz and the DJ and dance floor are notoriously lame.  Lots of local bands and some touring acts play here from time to time.  I've never gone to one of those shows and, frankly, I'm kinda baffled as to where they set them up.

One of my ex-boyfriends once tried to get frisky in one of the banquet rooms.  I'm not that kind of a girl and it smelled like salad dressing, so I passed.  But if that's your bag, there's always that possibility.Well, props to the Fertitta Brothers for trying hard to make another extension to the wealth-producing, union-friendly Station brand. They tried to make an upscale place in the heart of Summerlin. I got stuck in one of their 5th floor king rooms with a gorgeous view of the parking structure. The "mini-bar" has sensors that charges you an exhorbitent amount if you remove the tiny alcohol bottles for more than 30 seconds. Yikes. There is this silly "convenience fee" they charge for a newspaper, a shoe shine, and a "complimentary" shuttle service to the airport. LOL. They charge twelve bucks for a little baggy with Q-Tips located in the bathroom. ROFL. You get the idea, here. On a positive note, the coffee in the coffee shop was pretty good. The organized outings and spa is a nice touch. And I have to admit the staff were at least competent and polite. The room is rather nicely appointed, all things considered, though the remote control for the television needed new batteries.  LMAO. You charge $150 a night and can't afford a five cent battery? My room was half way down the hall from the elevator and just getting to it was like a hike, the way the hotel was built. Bring your walking shoes. ;) Yes, the casino is very close to a work of art. No, I would never stay there again.The pizza is very large but cut into the small squares for its easy to eat.  They were pretty $$$, but it was pretty good.

We had the godfather and it was nice and spicy.  never had a pizza like that before.  The fried mushrooms were SO GOOD!!!!

all in all it was pretty good, but to be honest, i like Round Table much better, especially for the price, just too bad its so far from home!When I saw Anthony Bourdain eat a variety of fried delights on an old school Vegas episode of No Reservations, I knew I had to make a pit stop to Fremont Street during my next trip to Sin City.  And by golly, I did just that.  Like I was going to pass up some fried Oreos?!?  Please.  Now sure, Mermaids seems kind of like a dump but really, it's charming in a way.  I just wish they had more seating (not just tables) at the back of he casino by the Nathan's.  Being able to sit down while enjoying my fried treats makes the experience just a bit more enjoyable.  I was quite impressed that you still get coins when you cash out and not a printed voucher.  Awesome!  You don't see that very often these days. Loved the fun and colorful exterior of Mermaids and especially enjoyed the jovial attitudes of the employees as well as the people playing and eating around me.  Again, not a top notch and high end casino but worth checking out while hanging out on Fremont Street.I eat at this restaurant at least 2 times per month because I live in the West and consider  this is the best Korean Restaurant in this area.  I believe there are 4 Korean restaurants in the west of I17. Yes, I agree their service can be improved.  Often I have to refill  my own water and take a bill to front instead of waiting for a waitress. I do not understand why the owner does not improve the service. Perhaps she does not read Yelp. But food is reasonably good. The other restaurant on west of 43 Ave has tastier and fresher side dishes but has limited  choice of main dishes.A rating of 3.5 would be most appropriate.  For entrees Ann ordered the 8-ounce filet while I went cowboy style by ordering the 16-ounce prime rib. Both entrees were perfectly cooked to medium rare as requested and included a baked potato with all the fixings.  My prime rib, served with au jus and a horseradish sauce, turned out to be a mammoth slab of beef with most of the outer ring of fat and near fat removed. It was very tasty, but a little tough.   I only wish our dog Max had been with us because it took a Herculean effort for me to finish it alone.  Dessert was out of the question.The pastries here are as yummy as ever, but the service is much to be desired. The blond woman who I assume is the manager pretty much berated one of the employees in front of me, making me a bit uncomfortable. I was about to say something, but decided "eh it's not me she's yelling at, so whatevs". I went on to order a baguette and she immediately went to the cash register without asking if I wanted anything else. I guess she assumed I couldn't afford the desserts here? Anywho, I asked for "2 macarohns". And she asked "Oh you want 2 macarOOns?". What a bitch to correct me using the WRONG word. A macarOOn is a coconut cookie dummy. I can't believe Buchon Bakery would actually employ white trash like her. But I guess in Vegas there isn't much to choose from. With her attitude and appearance she should be in the back sweeping up the kitchen floor.I was sad to find that Bouchon Bakery in the Venetian is only a stand (with no seats next to it) located under the escalator by the Phantom Theater. 

My chocolate almond croissant was amazzzzing but my mocha was just ok and I had to go back to re-ask for whipped cream because the barista forgot. 

Glad I was finally able to try Bouchon Bakery even if I did pass on the macaroons, but I wouldn't say its a must have in Vegas considering all the other delicious things nearby.CrackJax has been a Phoenix staple over the years and every time I visited Arizona growing up, I would always find my way to CrackerJax with each visit. From the go carts, to mini golf, the arcade and batting cages, there are options here that will provide visitors with hours of fun. So why the three stars you ask? Well...to be honest, poor little CrackerJax needs a face-lift in its old age. It's looking worn-out and tired from all the use over the years and the equipment is showing its age as well. 

This past weekend, I revisited my childhood by visiting CrackerJax for some driving range action. The driving range itself is great. The equipment works and I could spend hours there hitting golf balls that would hopefully make me somewhat of a golfer (which I am certainly not right now). On our way out, we passed by the batting cages and decided to take a shot at hitting a home-run. Well, sadly we didn't get a solid chance at the majors because the poor worn-out machines kept breaking and stalling on us! The staff came out several times and attempted to fix them, just for them to break again as soon as they left. When we told them they weren't working, they even questioned us and insinuated that we weren't operating them right. It wasn't until the machine blatantly broke in front of a staffer that they realized that yes, these poor little machines were on their last leg and not holding up so well. We ended up getting a couple rounds in and the staff was apologetic. Sadly though, this is a running theme with CrackerJax. I think this place is a great activity for kids of all ages, but I think they should start to think about keeping up with the growing city and renovate the prime real estate they have with better equipment. If they do, I'll be back and ready to spend rolls and rolls of quarters!CrackerJax is ok...but could be better.  It got my kids off the electronics, but the appearance/condition of some of the "attractions" (sorry, former Disney cast member here!) were less than desirable...  The mini golf turf needs some replacing - lots of bald spots.  Bumper boats need refreshing - most of the designs had faded off.

I'll let you in on a secret...if you have Chuck E. Cheese tokens (if you have kids, you DEFINITELY have these in your pile of change), bring 'em here.  Their arcade games accept them!  And the token machine dispenses them, too!Yes, it's an "Irish" bar but not a bad one. The beer selection is adequate, the ambiance is pubby and the food is passable. I had the "spicy" chicken curry and have to say that I have never had a more bland "curry" in my life. Here's a suggestion, put some curry powder in it!

Over all it's a nice enough place to hang out but I only go because it's close to my office, I certainly wouldn't make it a point to come here otherwise.We stopped by for korean bbq at 8pm. We ordered the King bbq beef platter and to my surprise, the meat had an overbearing scent to it. The closet thing I could compare it to.. is the scent that is associated with pork? It's odd! All of the cuts had that scent, some more so than others. I felt like the brisket had the heaviest scent, but my sister thought the sirloin had the most. I'm not sure if this is typical, as I was told by a local that food from the west coast isn't as good when compared to the east (water quality). 

I'm not too sure if I'll come back for future visits.. service was great, but the meat thing threw me off. Maybe I'm spoiled by my usual korean barbeque in philly?First thing we walk in the hostess was very nice and seated us right away, after we sat down and waited about 5-10 mins for our waitress to come over, and served us ice water, but didn't ask if we need anything else to drink. 
Then when our waitress is taking our order(that's after we waited for another 10 mins after the ice water is served) she didn't really smile or even make us feel welcomed....sad....! And no suggestion on the menu what so ever, plus the waitress was giving us a annoyed attitude seems like we took too long to order food from her and we are wasting her time!! 

After ordering, she brought me my coke but with no straw, ok... Maybe a lot of people don't use straw, but asking don't harm!! 

Over all the food served at a good amount of time and good quality as well, but the service are the only thing I was not pleased!!! 

I still suggest this place, for people who don't mind poor service but like fast service and good food!!!It's hard to beat $2 movies and $1 movies on Tuesdays.  They don't have stadium seating, but the floor slants enough where you don't see the heads in front of you blocking the screen.   I wanted to catch up on a few movies that I missed.  They were located on E Tropicana Ave/S Pecos Rd in Las Vegas.  I will be back.This is an ultra simple, fresh and healthy, locally owned sandwich experience. If that's all you expect, you will be pleased. I agree that eating so responsibly isn't as much fun.I've only been here once and I would go back again. The atmosphere is chill and it's not THAT far from my house. The Mac N Cheese is AMAZING and the drinks were consistent and delicious. Downside-only one pool table and the clientele while I was there was-for lack of better word-EH. lol But this is a cool place to go when you're not looking for something too ostentatious.The SF Supermarket had just opened when we were in Las Vegas in Nov 2009.  It was quite clean and really big supermarket with well-shelved items.  

We actually found items that are hard to find that originates from Singapore like Rojak Sauce, Gula Melaka.  Definitely a big plus for me!  

So why only 3 stars - at the bakery, I was about to buy some chicken pies.  The lady behind the counter was bustling here and there and happened to brush against the counter and the tongs fell to the floor.  I saw her pick it up and place it right back on the counter!  Ewwww!  No chicken pies for me!WEDNESDAY NIGHT RAW BAR $24.99
Snow Crab legs, Raw Oysters, Clams, Raw or Steamed, Mussels Hot or Cold. + Sushi, Prime Rib and much much more.
Very Satisfying, except the Raw Oyster were dry. I was vey happy and the service was AAA+.It's ok.  Not bad for the $15 bucks for dinner.There is a REASON WHY the pizzas here are $5.  All it takes is one bite.  

But I kinda agree with the other review.  This would be a great meal if I were homeless.Trader Joe's is what chain grocery stores like Pick'n Save (or anything under the Roundy's umbrella including Copp's and Rainbow), Piggly-Wiggly, Cub Foods, etc. should aspire to be like in terms of service and product.

That said, the one in Madison is especially clean and very tidy--things are pretty well organized that you can find what you're looking for by just looking around at the area of food it would be under. The prices are on the higher side of being affordable, but understandable as they attempt to make them a little more beneficial and "healthier" to some extent (not always true, but they try in a lot of cases.)

Here are some of my favorite products I'd recommend trying: Korean Short Ribs, Dark Chocolate Mint Creams, Sweet Potato Fries, Chili Pepper Sauce (not as spicy, but has a great flavor), and many of their meat cuts are pretty great too.

I'd avoid: the breads are only so-so, Sweet and Sour Chicken, TJ's soy sauce (you can get better and cheaper elsewhere), and milk (if you're getting Kemp's this is, again, cheaper elsewhere).

TJ's is great, but if I had a choice, I'd prefer Whole Foods at a cheaper price. Regardless, this is still a solid store and I go here when I'm particularly craving some good meals I can stick in the oven while I do homework.well it's free. And if you want to best experience try to avoid the crowds, so that might mean the morning. Or a weekday. It's cool when you walk in and you look up to see a lion paw bigger then your head. The last time i was here you can take a photo with a cub. Which I'm regretting not getting on because those cubs were so cute! Also i believe if you buy one of the souvenirs part of the profits goes to the habitat and the saving of lions. So buy that cute little stuff animal for some rascal in your life! :)My friend and I ate here for lunch before we were to head out to the Airport. It wasn't something I will rave about forever and a day. But it wasn't bad either.

It hit the spot. I'll take it :) Chicken wasn't over cooked. Sauce was flavorful. It worked quite well in a pinch when we were having a hard time trying to figure out what to do for food before our airport shuttle arrived.Since it's just become typical everywhere here in the valley, I quit complaining about prices here in town yrs ago- but if I hadn't.....  this is a very ordinary place selling pretty much very ordinary food. Their cajun turkey's probably the exception, it stands out.You have many eating choices while walking around the Miracle Mile. This is not a bad place to pick.  It's your typical bar food with a bunch of TV sets.  Nothing great, nothing bad.I was raving about this place to my coworkers all week after reading the reviews, so we finally decided to go! So excited! Met up there about 10:15a. Little did I know they ONLY served breakfast until 11a. I was hoping to get the oxtail thing, but after a long debate, I settled with wings and waffles. My coworkers had gotten there before me and had already ordered. 10 minutes later, I put my order in. Got the muddy water. Mmmm, sweet and tangy goodness.

The food ended up taking about 30-40 minutes. How horrible. There seemed to be 1 server for the whole place and 1 busser, and 1 cook. The server was impressive though, carrying 5 plates of food all on one hand. Other than that, I guess you can't expect great service.

But the important thing was the food! I actually got a side of pancakes also. And they came out first, before anyone's food. And they were yummy. There was a vanilla cinnamon flavor to them. And the waffles were probably the same batter which were delicious as well. When the wings and waffles finally did arrive, nice and hot, I was famished. The waffles were great, very soft and moist with a great flavor and the wings were cooked well and seasoned well. The hot sauce was great.

So overall, 4 stars for their food, 2 stars for service and atmosphere. Comes out to 3 stars. (Yay I can do math!)

Oh BTW, their music/speakers... funky stuff. As we were waiting for the food, we noticed that the music kept stopping. Like in a dance where they pause so you can change partners. Or maybe someone trying to practice DJ-ing. Either way, not very cool. At first it was fun to joke about, then it just got annoying.My spousal unit tried to find a cartridge for her CRICUT.  She tried to choose several different ones but they were ALL sold out. 

Also it was very difficult to hunt someone down.  It took about 45 minutes to find someone for assistance.

The seriously need a better system.Just a normal starbucks. I don't like this one as much as the one on rural because it's a lot smaller. Not a great place to study when you are inches away from the line of customers.Slow, slow, slow. Over 15 minutes for an iced green tea. Weren't busy and I could see her making it the whole time. Was like she was trying to move through the Labrea Tar Pits to make the tea...Wanted to try the famous Breakfast Buzz drink. I did not like the fact that it was already prepared ahead of time. That might have caused some stomach issues. I paid and one second later there it was. I don't care if your busy, make my drink fresh or don't make it it all. Plus at about 6 bucks, I think they are taking advantage of consumers cause of the popularity of the beverage.I had breakfast here this morning with a friend before we did a little grocery shopping at Whole Foods. 

It was my first time here, but my friend eats here all the time.  It's one of her favorite restaurants.  

I went with the garden omlette and apple cinnamon toast.  It was good and definitely tasted healthy.  Heather had the oatmeal with brulee topping and fresh berries.  I tried hers, it was pretty good too.  Everything was good, but not spectacular. 

There is lots of seating and the service was fast.  I wasn't wow'd by anything.  I will definitely try this place again.  I hear the sweet potato fries are excellent.Stopped in for a weekend breakfast.  The food was good and served quickly.  There seems to be some sort of weird local vibe going here.  People were filling up cups they brought from home at the soda fountain.  I found that strange.  Whatever.  

It is very casual.  You order at the counter and they'll bring it out to you.  This would be a good spot to go for breakfast if you have a few brats to take along.  Also saw some people on the patio with their dogs.The bane of my existence; places that offer quantity over quality. The food wasn't bad just par. The dessert was served from the Costco box it was purchased in and the hot dogs were, well hot dogs. Nothing special here. The prices were dirt cheap and I'm sure the local vagabonds love the all you can eat hot dog buffet. Yelp steered me wrong on this one. 3 STARS is appropriate.I have been sick for over a week now & was not in the mood to cook last night so I placed an online order & had my hubby go pick it up. I got our usuals; edamame, pork egg rolls & honey seared chicken with white rice. New items we tried were; crispy potsickers, mandarin kung pao chicken (mild) with fried rice & a cookie (they didn't run out this time!). The reason I dropped a star was because I gave my hubby that $10 gc that I had received about a month ago & they told him he couldn't use it. WTF, why not?! He said they didn't give him an explanation & I'm sure he was just in a hurry to get out of there. Next time I'll go pick it up myself & if I am able to use it, I'll give them back their star. If I'm not able to again, then idk if I'll be back...Bought 2 pizza's to go. An American and a margherita with extra bazil. They were ok. Very expensive. $31 for 2 12' pizza's. As for the crust, very thin and crispy. Cooked nicely. The flavor just wasnt there. The basil didnt make the pie pop like it should. What I have to compair this to is Grimaldis and La Piazza Al Forno. Thats tough competition. Those two are the best of the best. My wife and I would might make it again for a date night, but not with the kids.Hey what in cool place in Queen Creek! It's totally off the beaten path, tucked away in a lonely strip mall corner. We've lived here almost 2.5 years and I never knew about this place! I was soooooo sick of Uncle Bears this came as a refreshing suprise...Thursday night happy hour is 1.50 domestic beers and 2.99 chicken strippers. Wow, that's cheap for strippers! haha Anyway try the honey hot! they are yummy! Great place, friendly bartenders and a bar area that separates the restaurant. The place was packed, we met some great people! Give this place a try, totally worth it. I know we will be back again!We belong to the eclub and get weekly coupons. just yesterday had a spend $30 get $10 off.  It was lunch so the bill came to $25.  We were able to buy two muffins to bring the bill up.  I like eating there.  Only gave it three stars because I have had a few not so good meals.  One thing seems to be consistent..don't order the eggs benedict.  I love the broiled flounder and my husband loves their salmon.  Liver and onions usually over cooked.  Most often staff is very accommodating. I'm a big fan of their blue cheese bacon and chicken quesidilla which is off the menu but the cooks is accommodating and makes it for me. Meal may not be a five star, but can't beat buy one, get one free.  Give it a try!The best thing about this restaurant is definitely all the pictures of dogs. The restaurant has a very cool theme!

I didn't care too much for the food though, although it was alright. And it didn't really seem to be worth the price, but in any case we had a good time dining here.It's always a project coming here. No matter what time your appointment is you will sit there for at least 30-45 mins before its your turn. Then when you are done with your pictures you usually wait another 20 mins or so until a computer opens up. Once you finally get to sit down its another 20 - 30 mins waiting for them to go through all their packages. Even when you tell them you only want one picture if one pose they still make you sit through all the packages. The pictures come out good, but the while experience is a drawn out hassle.This place is fine, not great, just fine.  I like that I don't have to make an appointment and can just stop in with my daughter on the drive home from school.  We usually end up waiting about 15 minutes which isn't too bad.  I have gone in where the wait was close to an hour and we just left.  The prices are good and it is close/convenient which is the main reason I come here.The Jim Beam burger is VERY good.The food is good but not earth-shattering for the price. There's better quality food in Phoenix for the same price range. I really enjoyed the ambiance. The service was excellent at the beginning but then sadly fizzled out.I am all for paying for quality.  But this place seems a little price-y even for the deliciousness.  $4 for a simple baguette, that had probably been sitting out much of the day, judging on its texture once consumed?

also, big minus points for closing at 5.  what's the point of staying open for the rest of the afternoon if you are going to close right when folks get off of work?

simply bread is definitely very delicious, and i love it when i end up at a restaurant that uses their loaves - but their storefront is definitely disappointing.The BF picked up Pei Wei for dinner tonight (I have a cold and he wanted to get me some soup :-) ). We also have a bunch of gift cards to pf changs, which neither of us really likes so much, so we used one here. So we ordered online, which is a neat feature. I like how when you order online it allows you to pick and choose what ingredients you don't want and extras you might want. So anyway, when the BF got to the restaurant he paid and then was told it would just be a minute. He waited ten minutes and then asked how long it would be. The person working there said that our food was sitting on the counter, they were just waiting for the soup. So that was pretty bad, all the food was just sitting out for 15 minutes, the BF asked for them to remake the food and was given attitude. Eventually, they did remake the food. If they knew they didn't have soup, why would they box up all the rest of the food? It doesn't make sense. 

As for the taste of the food, it was mediocre. We got a couple potstickers, wonton soup, orange chicken, and dandan noodles. The potstickers are weird, less noodle, more like fried bread around the meat. Not so good. The wonton soup was pretty good, definitely the best thing we ordered. The orange chicken was alright and so were the dandan noodles. Everything was really salty... the pf chang way I guess. SO I would have to say that if i was going to eat pf changs, this is a nice, cheaper option, and the food is close to the same.Mixed feelings. I like the food. The broth was slightly sweet.. and the veges didnt taste fresh... But i am speaking from a girl from california where these a pho restaurants around every corner.
I would visit again.The cycle of life has inspired me to again pursue a more fit lifestyle.  There are lots of discount options available through my employer, so after visiting some of the choices available, LA Fitness won the challenge of convenience, hours and price.

$25 a month, first and last to start, no start-up fee.  The locations near home (about 6 blocks away) and near work (also about 6 blocks away), I can follow my mood and either swim in the morning before or in the evening after work.  

Today, I visited the location by home.  It is the location I started my LA Fitness experience. 

The locker room is big, ok sized lockers, tile floors certainly cleaner appearing than the carpet on Priest.  The benches are also cleaner.  .

This location has a clean pool, sauna, hot tub and steamroom.  The showers are clean and bright.  I did not see any standing water; while there, a work crew was replacing the door between the locker room and shower.  

There is one big water spot on the ceiling that disturbs me.  Since it is a lap pool, what I see appears to be due to a leak in the roof.  Another challenge...this location does not have the towel service that Priest does.  For $10 a month, why no towels at this location?

I stopped in at this location when checking out 24 hour and LA Fitness.  The salesguy at this location reminded me of a used car salesman.I first discovered Boba at a place in Tempe called Aurora Espresso.  Unfortunately, that place no longer exists, but Lollicup is a satisfactory replacement.  The tea and boba are great, well worth the trip when I am in the mood for boba.  The jelly and pudding are also quite good, but I enjoy the boba the best.  The smoothies are also good, but I usually avoid them with boba, as it hardens and is not as good.  I also like the stamp card, as I like to make multiple visits.

My complaints with this place pertain to some logistical things.  First off, not having the ability to use my credit card is frustrating at times.  Also, there have been times when I drove all the way over there during business hours only to discover they are closed, that is quite irritating.  Realistically though, it is still a great place to get some boba tea.Not sure why this Dave and Buster's is classified as a Jillians Restaurant, but whatever.

Work conferences can be ok, but once the workday ends, what is there to do?  I couldn't go back home, obviously, so I went searching in my rental.  Luckily, across the street from the JW Marriott there was a Dave and Busters.

Ok, so I am used to the D&Bs in both Milpitas and San Diego.  I'm talking crowded, like you have yell at someone 1 foot away from you if you need to talk to them.  Crowded like if you show up after 6pm, the wait for a table at the restaurant is over an hour.  Crowded like you have to throw some elbows around to get a drink.  Oh yeah, and if you show up after 10pm, there is that silly $5 cover charge.  This is absolutely not the case at this D&B.

We got there on a Wednesday, so when we checked this place out the first night, I expected it to be empty, and it was.  Fine.  We went Thrusday night, a semi-party night, but again, it was pretty much empty.  Ok.  Friday night rolls around.  This is a party night in any big city, but AGAIN, not much of a crowd.  Saturday night had a slightly higher turnout, but still pretty much an open house.

Though it was a little disappointing at first, I came to realize this was a blessing in disguise.  I could walk in at any time, sit at a booth and get served right away.  If I needed credits for my card, I could walk up immediately to a machine and get it recharged.  If there were any games I wanted to play, no lines.  It truely was beautiful.

After flipping through their elaborate drink menu, I settled for "The Shizzle."  Thank you Snoop Dogg for placing that suffix into everyday vocabulary.  Anyway, "The Shizzle" did taste great, so props for appropriate use of the word.

The one bad memory I had was that my stuffed animal got jacked while I was playing a basketball game.  I wanted to get something for my baby, so I must have pumped at least $10 into that crane/claw game.  Each time the claw decends, grips onto the prize, but then slips out of its grasps encouraged me to keep trying.  Addicting.  After my first one was jacked, I was determined to get another.  With an amazing twist of fate, I got three in one try, so after that I called it a night.

Oh yeah, and now that I think about it, I think we got ripped off because we always came at happy hour, but I think they charged us full price for drinks.  Just a tip, always ask for an itemized receipt.The price is outrageous over there.  My babies needed to go back for their heartworm refill appointment and I called thinking this visit isn't going to break the bank.  Boy, was I wrong! It was going to be almost $300 for the both of them! I almost swallowed my tongue whole at the thought of spending that much money to get a refill.  Get this, they were charging $45 for the test, $45 for the doc's exam and $38 for the heart card.  Say what?

So, feeling a bit bamboozled, I called another vet and it's going to cost half the price for both of my Chis.  Shame! Shame on you VCA! I'm getting their files transferred immediately.Very good pizza, salads and drinks.  Great neighborhood place. Atmosphere is first rate and sitting on the terrace with torches is awesome.  On music nights you will find the music unexpectedly good. My only negative is that service is lack luster at best.What I like:
This store is pretty large, but not overwhelming. The areas are clearly marked, well organized, easy to shop, and have a decent amount of variety in each section. There's lots of parking outside, and if the registers are well-staffed, you've got plenty of checkout options.

What I don't like:
Thrifting is really hit or miss, but it was all miss. It looks like it's pretty picked over, so I was left with a dog from every town. While the clothing section was okay, the other sections aren't quite as well organized. Sure, it's tough to organize things when they're all one-of-a-kind, but it was a touch cluttered. I don't worry too much about that--this is thrift store shopping, after all--but it only takes a few extra minutes to tidy it up.

What I'm indifferent about:
Pricing. They do have that color-coded discount thing going on, so you can save some bucks depending on the week. That's kinda cool. But on the daily, it's pretty much what you'd expect to pay. Cheap, which I love. But not any cheaper than other thrift stores. Also, they have a little bit of everything, but nothing that got me wowed. Selection was just average.The food is great. I love me some homemade rice&beans....Red burrito w/machaca meat please. Chips and salsa are also yummy. 
Customer service is hit or miss. Everyone is really nice until you need extra napkins or more chips.  They do it with a smile, but then you hear them yelling in the back at each other. And whats the deal with the chips...self serve?..they serve?..free or is there a charge. Self seating, you seat us?  Always changing. No bueno Sylvia. The food has remained delicious..so Sylvia's gets 5 stars for the food, but 2 for customer service, 1 for inconsistency. Average 3 stars.We really used to love the place for the chips and sals bar as well.  Food is good, not excellent. They changed their concept, by ordering in advance and getting it delivered at you table to being waited at the table and having a small basket of chips and salsa served.
It's okay, but not my favorite.They have quite a selection of dishes here.  Decent for a buffet.  Actually, one of the better 'Chinese' food buffets.  If you ever go during prime-time there's always a line waiting for the snow crab legs & throngs of Asians.  I really like their steamed clams, but I like most clams.  The sushi........ neh.  It's alrite, but if that's what u're goin for, go somewhere else!Tonight we stopped in here for a light dinner, not wanting to spend a fortune on food my teenager wouldn't finish.

We shared an amazing BLT. Really a great sandwich. The young lady at the table next to us had a chopped salad that I will definitely try the next time we come here.

It was very humid tonight, and we sat outside despite the many empty ables inside. Also, they serve wine by the glass, have a wide variety of sodas and waters, and have a retail section (we didn't check it out, we were too hungry.)

I will come here again.Easy to get to location...just like every other 7 Eleven, it has everything from drinks to snacks to alcohol. Stopped for gas and an energy drink...no hassle, quick in and out...no complaints!Recently, my husband and I got our wedding cake through Freed's as provided by our venue. I would give the service 1 star, but the actual cake on the day of our wedding was delicious and for that I give the flavors 5 stars. I had endless issues with this bakery during our original tasting, and almost nixed having a wedding cake entirely! Just about everything that you can think of going wrong, did. However, in the end we were able to work things out with Max and I could not have been happier with the cake that was delivered on the day of our wedding. I would say to be 100% clear and forward with your vision when you come to this bakery, and to stand your ground about what you want. Don't be afraid to speak up!I hate to hate, but who designed the hideously unflattering cocktail waitress uniforms? They are just...no. 

I can get past the outdated decor with the random floral paneling, but I was just depressed by the whole cocktail waitress situation. They clearly weren't happy to be wearing those abominations, and I wasn't happy to be seeing them. 

Nobody was happy.

But if you can get past that, The South Point does have countless movie theaters, an equestrian show, a bowling alley, a bar where all tequila drinks (including sizable shots of Don Julio and other premium tequilas!) are $2 at happy hour, and most importantly, $5 blackjack and craps.

Translation: If you don't mind being away from the Strip, get drunk and gamble here. It's a good time.Don't get me wrong I love this place, but lately it seems like the bartenders don't care anymore. I don't know if it's because of management or they really don't care about their customers. It's not just one bartender either, it's all of them. I always order take out and like to have a beer while I'm waiting for my food. It always takes 5 to 10 minutes for them to even acknowledge that I'm there. It seems like they are always trying to leave before I finish my order. It's sad because I always tip well even if it's not deserved. It's not going to stop me from going because I love the food. They have the best wings I've ever had, no matter what time I go the wings are always good. I'm a chef and I love to cook, but I still can't stay away. On a side note, the parking is horrible. I don't know who the Hell U-Haul thinks they are, but they have taken over the parking lot. I used to park in the desert in the back, but now they have put their trailers in the way of that too. I've been going there since it opened and will continue to do so. I just hope the bartenders wake upWhy did we go to a Japanese restaurant in Vegas? Right, our friends wanted to try it, forgot to tell them there was one in Pasadena....We got seated at a window seat with great views of strip. Think I liked our seat much better than the food. 

My gf and I ordered specialty cocktails, both were sweet and weak. 

Our food:
Filet Mignon with Ginger Teriyaki Sauce, Japanese style potatoes, sautéed garlic beans: it was cooked perfect to medium rare, hubby liked the sauce, I liked the beans

Miso soup: nothing special, it was OK

Premium sashimi (10 pc): they were fresh, but really nothing better than what I had at the Japanese restaurants near my home, $50 is kinda pricey just for that 

Our friends food:
3 orders of albacore, baked lobster roll, California roll: I tried a little bit of each dish, they were OK, yummy but not great, nobody liked the baked lobster roll, too creamy for our taste. I didn't think they liked the food too much, they couldn't even finish it, kept asking me to eat more for them....

The food was good but nothing outstanding, service was good but not great, our food tab with one alcohol drink, one double espresso was $143, it was not really worth it in my opinion, oh well... At least the views were great......:)This location is only ok.  

Its right around the corner from my house, but, so is the location on trop and jones...and I like that one better.

This location is a little ghetto for me, but they almost always have what I'm looking for, food wise. 

They also have a lady who works with the meat/seafood who is AWESOME.  She always remembers my roommates and I, even when we haven't been there in a few months...we saw her the other say for the first time in a while, and she said "Where have YOU guys been?!"  It was pretty cool.

Friendly staff, and pretty clean...just a little run down.I did not like this spa at all. The winding hallways are super long, the treatments mediocre, the rest areas loud and coed, and the staff were all straight out of massage school. As much as I love my men folk, they add a totally different vibe in a spa atmosphere.  Another thing, who goes into a spa dressing room and then has to go into another dressing room within the dressing room to get dressed? What, women ca'nt get undressed in front of one anoher in a dressing room?  This spa just seemed so...public and weird.very good mall has all the stores. closest thing i have seen to south coast plaza in orange county. but why not 4 star and 3 star? here is why: i always have a hard time finding restrooms in this mall. you have to walk for 10 min to find restrooms. its not only me, my friend said the same thing about this mall.Not the most amazing place I've ever been to.  Decent food.  Really like the atmosphere.  It's a bar.  Although sometimes some of there TV's dont work.  Not really a sprots bar though.Lee's is an alcohol enthusiasts playground. At least this is what I would say if half the stuff I was looking for was not out of stock. Usually when I visit, I just want a bottle of wine, but I was in the mood for sake today. The shelf was almost cleared clean. With that option stricken from the table, I just picked up a bottle of wine and framboise. I noticed that some of the wines can be purchased for cheaper at a local supermarket. Sometimes you will find some great deals, but not always.Food never really disappoints. Nothing really sticks out for me to crave this place. Nothing too special. 

Ive had the Thai Beef Salad which is pretty good. The spice level at this place isn't too spicy. A level 5 is very tolerable. I don't constantly have to grab my water from the spiciness. 

The Pad Thai here is kind of mediocre. The noodles were served to us over done and are stuck together, which I don't like. The flavors did go well together though.

The service is usually quick. They check on you at the right times. The food comes out at reasonable time. The restaurant is usually below freezing so bring a light sweater.Kind of disappointing for the price.  I ordered a filet Oscar rare, as it should be, and confirmed that they understand what "rare" means.  My steak came out medium-well!  Kind of dry and had lost a lot of the flavor and tenderness you expect from a properly cooked filet.  I didn't send it back since it had already taken a while and we had a show reservation after dinner.  I didn't want to risk the time.

The price is commensurate with any top-end steak house, but the result wasn't.

We also had some of their famous crabs and they were very good.  The claws were pre-cut enough to make it pretty easy to get the meat out.  Their mustard sauce for the crab was very good, though honestly I prefer them with just butter.

Service was very friendly, and she was really helpful on picking out menu items and her knowledge of the ingredients was perfect.

I don't think I'd try it again since for the price, I don't want to risk another blah over-cooked steak.Stumbled across this place by accident on a trip out to Suncoast.

It's edible.

This isn't the most delicious or authentic greek food I've ever had, but it isn't terrible.  

Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but also wouldn't tell anyone it's not worth trying at least once.

Overall, just average.Gotta give it a 3 1/2 stars.

After constantly passing by Mimi's Café for years to get our Sunday bagel at Einstein's next door, we finally took a chance and walked in.  The wifey and I were convinced that if there's always a crowd on the weekend for breakfast maybe it's worth a look-see.

Mimi's Café always rubbed me as an 'old folks' eatery, since there is often an abundance of seniors eating here just like another restaurant I know called Marie Callendar's.  The inner décor of Mimi's was nice enough, kind of a French bistro/New Orleans vibe with the deep reds and the dark browns, and jazz playing in the background.  But the place did overall keep an airy, breezy feeling with lots of windows and natural light.

Looking at the menu, Mimi's is definitely on the French cuisine end.  Lots of French inspired food options for breakfast.  Especially the headings...hilarious!  Things like 'Les Waffles',  'Le Griddle', and 'Les Omelettes' made me chuckle inside.  I kept thinking a French version of the Muppets' Swedish Chef (yes, I know that is an oxymoron of sorts) was in the kitchen about to make my meal.  

After ordering some drinks we tackled what to try.  The wifey got the Strawberry Waffle Perdu, Mimi's original pain perdu filling of cream cheese and orange marmalade on three petite waffles topped with fresh strawberry sauce.  I got tall stack of four Mimi's Original Buttermilk Pancakes.  We both opted to make our entrees a 'Le Grande Breakfast' for an extra $2.29 each.  With this we got two eggs made any style, and our choice of bacon, pork or turkey sausage, ham, or Bayonne-style corned beef hash.

15 minutes later it seems the French (Swedish) Chef had our order done!  Nice looking plates with little fuss.  Both dishes came with a bowl of fruit as a side which was a nice touch.  Overall the food was pretty good, and the servings were decent.  The wifey's Strawberry Waffle Perdu were good even though a bit on the sweet side with the strawberry sauce.  The waffles were not soggy, with a nice crisp exterior but a slight chew to the inside.  Mimi's pancakes were actually very good!  Light, not doughy, not overcooked, with just enough flavor from the whipped butter and warm maple syrup.  My eggs were cooked a perfect over easy and great for dipping pancakes into yolk-y goodness.  But for us the standout were the little patties of corned beef hash!  We love corned beef hash for breakfast (even the crap from the can), and Mimi's was a winner!  Meaty, but not salty, and with just enough filler to keep them together.  Went perfect with pancakes and eggs.

Service was good at least for us, our server was polite, very attentive, and made sure our drinks were topped off.  Too bad she didn't have a French accent!

I'd be back here again to Mimi's for lunch if the menu is still on the French inspired end.  For breakfast it was a bit pricy, for two of us with drinks, entrees, tax and tip it came to just shy of $30.  I don't mind spending money, but I really believe breakfast should be on the cheap end.  So if you're value conscious you may be better off at your local Denny's for your Grand Slam.  Come to Mimi's if you want a little frou-frou with your coffee.I usually don't find myself walking around this end of downtown. The wandering hobos around here seem to be more disgruntled than my usual encounters in other parts of town. But, I'm not here to review downtown hobos. I'm here for some gyro talk.

Kabob Korner is a small, yet comfy little spot. Their menu had many more American items than I expected (wings, chicken fingers, burgers, etc.). I guess they have to make "general public" food to get more business. I went for something a little in between the common and traditional. For around $8, I got myself a chicken gyro combo, which came with the gyro, fries and a drink.

 Gyro was only ok. It made for a decent lunch, but nothing memorable.  I even had a bite of the super gyro (lamb) from whom I was eating with, which was far tastier than mine. Still, it wasn't tasty enough for me to go out of my way to get here. I actually enjoyed their seasoned fries more than my gyro.

Will I come back? Probably not. Though their more traditional items looked good, it didn't seem like enough to win my appeal. It looks like the only reason for me to shuffle through hobos in this part of town is the coffeehouse across the street.My boyfriend and I went to see the Color Purple at the Smith Center. Unfortunately we could only get balcony seats. My boyfriend who is scared of heights almost freaked out when he seen how high we had to sit. The seats were close together and most people had to constantly stand when someone wanted in or out. Don't even think about going to the restroom!
The stage was so far, it could have been my next door neighbor with a wig on playing multiple characters and I wouldn't have known since you could not make out faces. I also noticed people sitting in the box seats on the left side had to hunch over to look down at the play, it looked uncomfortable. A few fortunate people brought binoculars, lucky them. Since this was out first time there we learned a lesson. My daughter and I are going to see Wicked and you better believe we got some of the best seats. 
The place is nice and the staff is great but the balcony seats are not worth paying for.The Broadway Series of musicals is fantastic! As I had been there before, I honestly thought there want a bad seat in the house. I was wrong. Left gallery was actually above the speakers, make the words to Evita almost inaudible. The production was great and I enjoyed the performance, but would highly recommend being no less than 2-3 floors up, if you can help it.This is a cool circular bar in the center of the Red Rock Resort & Casino. They have trendy drinks and pack a punch in old favorites like bloody Mary's for the morning after. We had a cool time lounging and having some after dinner drinks here.Just left Buzz BBQ and I need a nap lol very good portions if you have kids their meals are free with an adult meal so very wallet friendly! We had the pulled pork which was very tender and juicy! Sauce was mediocre and service a little slow but overall it's an alright BBQ joint I'd like to try their smoked turkey for the holidays...Great, central location. The view from our room was fantastic - overlooking Bellagio fountains. Room decor was ok, bed comfortable, bathroom very spacious. The price was very good too. 

The buffet place downstairs served really delicious food, but was way overpriced. I guess that's typical for a city where there aren't restaurants on every corner. Supply and demand... 

The on-site casino was pretty good. Our dealer was super pleasant and friendly; i wish i had remembered his name I'd put it out here for everyone to see... 

The front desk were not very friendly... They wouldn't help us with our boarding passes. Perhaps, being used to California hospitality i expect too much... 

The club, whatever the name was... oh, I remember, Prive, was very disappointing. We were on the guest list, yet had to wait in line for one whole hour, and then ended up paying the bouncer a pretty big sum to only get in and get totally disappointed. 

The lobby is a maze and it's not hard to get lost there... 

The housekeeping manager was very nice. I came back home and realized i had left a piece of clothing there. Called them, the housekeeping manager was a sweet lady who promptly returned my phone call after I had left a voicemail, and shipped my item back to me at a pretty reasonable price... 

Will probably go back if the price is still good.My boyfriend and I went there for the first time this past weekend.  Walking in (past the patio and noisy 101) I was a little apprehensive about the place.  It looked upscale and expensive but was more than half empty on a Saturday night.

I found the food to be average in every way...taste, presentation and price.  My boyfriend really liked his burger and the fries were hot and crispy but my caesar salad was limp and bland.  I had two martini's and while the price was decent, they were weak and just OK.

In my opinion, Earl's is nothing special and you can get much better for less.We enjoyed our food, and the atmosphere. You definitely pay for the atmosphere. But it was quiet and relaxing. We enjoyed our meal.Better than we expected.

We stopped in fairly late on Tuesday night and it was still quite busy.  There were three of us and we ordered the lamb vindaloo, a lamb special, sag paneer and naan.   We requested them "chef spicy," which our charming waitress informed us was as hot as it gets.  We were delighted to discover that this was actually quite spicy.

Both lamb dishes were excellent.  The naan was fresh and hot from the oven.  My only quibble was with the saag paneer which was heavy on the saag and light on the paneer, but still pretty good.

It's a bit pricey for a neighborhood Indian joint - about $60 for the three of us with one beer, but it's also a bit nicer than the typical Indian restaurant.   Service was friendly and efficient.

We'll be back.Prices go up and bagels get smaller, used to go with wife for a lunch now and then but to poor service and fear of prices still going up we stopped.
And with the high prices they even have the nerve to have a tip jar near register making awkward for  people just getting some take out.I found out about The Coffee Shop as they were one of the winners on Food Network's Cupcake Wars.  I've got a huge sweettooth so I was excited to try this place.  

We decided to have a late breakfast so my daughter & I shared the San Diegan (an open face omelette with bacon, sour cream, potatoes, feta, green onions, cheddar and mushrooms.  This omelette had all of my favorite ingredients.  It wasn't too salty, maybe just a little too oily but the feta added a nice tang.  It kind of tasted like a baked potato with eggs and feta.

My husband had the Papas Grande Burrito (potatoes, eggs, bacon and cheese).  My husband said it was OK; pretty good.

We picked up a Bostom Cream Pie and MIxed Berry cupcakes to bring back to the hotel.  I was pretty disappointed with the cupcakes (the breakfast dishes were better).  Although the cupcakes were moist, they were just average.  Not exactly the "wow" factor I was expecting as winners of Cupcake Wars.  But don't get me wrong, they weren't terrible.  Just OK.Definitely love the feel of the place and that they have free wi-fi and ample outdoor seating. Always a fan of independent coffee shops. The iecd chai-latte was delish but way overpriced as I got about 5 sips out of it due to all the ice. It's as pricey, if not a bit more, than Starbucks, and refills on just coffee was overpriced in my mind. I'm used to independent coffee shops that charge hardly anything for just coffee refills while you're sitting in the shop. They have sandwiches and other foods for lunch, too.
Cool place though. Check it out if you get a chance.How sad is it that my only view of the Strip came from inside one of their shuttles?

One of the many rental car centers I've come across that's a 5-10 minute drive from the airport.  All the rental companies are centrally located, and you hop off the bus and head to your counter.

National's Emerald Aisle and Executive members have their choice of the lot, but small SUVs (my rental of choice) were MIA.

My Garmin got me back incident-free, even with construction (but signage is minimal).  Fair amount of gas stations close by.I tried this place because it was open 24 hours and I was really craving good Asian food. When we got there, it was pretty open. There wasn't that many people. 

We ordered the bu go gi, which is my favorite type of Korean BBQ. Since I didn't really want to smell like it, I had them cook it instead of us. THe small dishes that came out weren't as good as other places that I had tried. I don't even remember them coming out with the spicy pickled cucumbers like most Korean restaurants have. The kimchi was also not very spicy. 

When we got the bul go gi, it was nicely cooked and a huge portion, but it lacked flavor. We couldn't finish half of it. I also think this place wasn't really worth the money. It was a good portion for two people, but the food was just okay, nothing special.I'll say it again: it's a mall. The only difference here is it's in the ghetto Planet Hollywood and therefore a little more affordable for most folks. It's really dark though, and bathrooms are hard to find.The salmon burger was fair and the yam fries excellent.  They had modello especial on tap which was nice.  The service was friendly.  They've got kobe beef and other burger options as well.Nice enough diner to have within casino... Pretty good menu similar to Cheesecake Factory...My girlfriend and I got the bright idea to check out the swab meet to buy little nick-nacks from our Vegas trip.  Check Yelp and Broadacres came up so we decided to give it a try.  We arrived about 3pm on a Friday and it was dead.. I am sure if we had arrived earlier there would have had more than 30% of the stands open and if we waited until Saturday I am sure that it would be amazing!  

We walked a little over half and the swab meet is huge.. We didn't come across any survivors.. bummer!If you dont get your fair intake of made in Japan fall apart goods, This is the place for you. Walking down the stained carpet isles of this place all while inhaling the stench of Greasy food and Liz Claibourne. But like some other reviewers pointed out, this is a swapmeet, I guess I was hoping for more of a variety,  I could have left wearing a new Airbrushed Mi Vida Loca shirt pulling a new Fucci Suitcase, swinging my new nun-chucks... If thats your thing this is your place. I preffer the outdoor swapmeet to this one.We went late on a Sunday afternoon and just made it in time for their lunch specials. Three mini tacos was the perfect amount of food and it allowed me to try three different kinds. I got the steak, shrimp, and chicken tacos. The steak and chicken were really good, the shrimp taco was good too, but I'm partial to the Baja Fresh shrimp taco-that one is my favorite. My boyfriend got the carnitas taco and said it was really good too. I wasn't too impressed with the salsas. The green one was my favorite. The atmosphere was great for either a quiet afternoon lunch, but I could also see it being a really fun place for night life too! I can't wait to go back and order a margarita! I love the simple, straight-forward menu and the extremely reasonable prices. Our server/bartender was very nice too!I've been here twice, both for flair bartending competitions. The first time we had a great time, however the bartender wasn't great at giving us service. We would have to wait long intervals before each round. The second time we sat at the tables, ordered drinks and food. Both servers we had, Jenny and Amy, were great. We got the sautéed mushrooms (yum!!) and shrimp jammers (different but good). I'll continue coming back for the flair comps, but not much else.Review for casino only.

Every time I come into this place, it's a gigantic party. I think it's because of the central location, cheap/free alcohol, and cheap table limits. Or maybe it's because it's always 2am when I roll in here.

It's a great place to hit up later once you've had some drinks and you're ready for a party. I've seen some drunk people sing karaoke, but this place had people that could barely stand singing all kinds of random songs. The people watching, especially late-night, is top notch here.

Definitely add this place to your Las Vegas casino crawl.We ordered the chicken and lamb tikka and my wife order the chicken tikka.
The food is just ok in my opinion, nothing that yells I need more of this.  My wife agreed.
The lamb pieces were very small and the fat was not completely trimmed off.  The chicken was good.
The tabbouleh was the best thing we ate here.
The service was very friendly and the food came out in good time.This is my updated review from one star to three. Why the one star at first? Well, false advertisement with the whole "comedy on deck" thing. They need to remove this from their name, including their picture, since there was no comedy whatsoever on this tour. Being in Vegas where shows abound, I was just expecting that twist on a tour. At least the Tour Guide told us upfront not to expect this. Judging by other reviews and pictures, this does seem to happen or have happened at some point.

The trip was not a total loss however. The Tour Guide was beyond informative with facts. The stop for breakfast at Omelet House was very nice and filling. The brief stop at Hoover Dam was unexpected. That was a nice surprise. I didn't read about it anywhere when I booked my tour. This stop needs to be longer than just twenty minutes. It wasn't even a long enough stop to walk across the bridge. 

Things to look for and plan:

* Go with the option of food with this tour. You will be very hungry if you don't. Although there is a dining option without prepaying at Grand Canyon, it will be more expensive there. The lunch here was simple but, pretty darn good. Or, just take some sandwiches or finger food with you in a carry-on bag. The stop at Omelet House was worth it. I ended-up going back for breakfast the next day. You are given a card on the bus where you pick-out which options you want.  

* Walking onto the Sky Bridge at Grand Canyon is not included in the price of this tour. Very pricey actually. Had I known this before hand, I would have taken more cash with me. Also, if you already have a ticket for this, you are strongly urged to do this first due to timing and other busses/tourists there. You can buy this and other options on the bus before getting there.

* After being there myself and seeing what they do, I highly recommend paying extra money for a Helicopter Tour. You can purchase this option while there but, strongly discouraged due to timing issues. I will next time, you'll see what I mean while there.

* This is not the Grand Canyon with the funny looking rocks in the middle of nowhere that you see in pictures and movies. This is the side with the very impressive and large ditch that if you fall, you will never come back. Be very careful at the edges. Other than the Sky Bridge, there are no handrails. 

* Pay attention to the times. You are crossing a different time zone.

* Even going through Expedia and Groupon, I was surprised with an additional $8.89 fee for random this and that. We were already on the way there so I didn't find it appropriate to ask questions.

* At Hoover Dam, you will be viewing it from afar from the highway. You will not be going to the Dam itself. Still awe inspiring and picturesque though. Just hurry now, before you know it your twenty minutes are up. 

Both these trips, if you rented a car, can easily be done by yourself with no hidden fees or rush. Neither is that far from The Strip. Specifically Hoover Dam. Next time, I'm driving to both myself. It's not as far as it seems from looking at the distance on a map. My suggestion, they need to deduct some time from the entire stop at Grand Canyon and add it to Hoover Dam. Although an historic ancient place, majestic and awe inspiring; way too much time is spent at Grand Canyon. 

This tour is ideal for anyone that opted not to rent a vehicle while in Las Vegas. I did rent a vehicle and saw quickly how easily I could have done this on my own. You can thank me later. :e)Great Place to eat for a quick lunch. Lunch specials are always good. Service can be a little slow at times if you have a pressing schedule and need to make it back to the office on time this may not be your best choice.

It's also a nightlife party bar for the younger crowd in the evening with a full bar both inside and out.

Not my favorite place to eat, but not too bad either.Eh wasn't too impressed.  I've had better wine and their selection was pretty limited.  I think they had more appetizers and dessert on their menu than wine.  We tried the Bree plate, stuffed strawberries, antipasto plate, olives, and the bread and dipping oil.  It was just ok, there wasn't anything that tasted so good that I wanted more.  
We also happened to go on a Saturday night when they had live music.  Sounds like a good idea but the place is so small and the music was so loud that you felt like you were sitting on top of the sub.I was bored.  I think the crowd is too old for me. I know, one day I will be old too...but until then, I will stay away from here.  Blush is great if you like breathing room.  It's fairly empty compared to a lot of places. The decor is modern and classy.  The music is house, which I guess is good if that's what you like.I must had really wanted pho when I was in Vegas...well. Duh. I probably had a hangover from partying the night before. But pho is pho...walked in and it was completely empty. The service was OK, but I can only imagine how slow it would be if there were actually people dining in the restaurant. It had parking too!

I got the regular rare steak pho...and eh. It was OK. Not the worst pho I've had, but not the best either. Definitely just...OK.Ok, so I have to admit, there are plenty of good and bad reviews for this place, but I am a sandwich junkie so I had to try it. Also not sure why its only for those who are drink, I mean can you really taste the food when you are drunk (where has Greasy Tony's gone). 

Anyway I thought I would try it as I work in Tempe and I am always on the lookout for good sandwich places. One thing I have noticed now days, sandwiches are expensive and its nearly impossible to find a place that gives a good amount of food at a reasonable price. 

I got a roast beef sandwich and it was actually very tasty. Though it was good, the $8 for a sandwich alone is a little more than I want to spend on a regular basis. 

I guess I just have to decide if I want a $5 foot long that is mostly bread, or a good sandwich that is going to cost some mucho denero!It's like a Chuck E Cheese for adults. Decent food, drinks and games (video games + billiards). They used to have decent prizes you could win with tickets (XBOX, TVs, PSP, jukebox, etc) but now they junk prizes like novelty hammers and Spongebob boxers. My favorite plate is the Lacy Chicken and my favorite dessert is their banana fosters pie.Perfect drunk food.  Sandwiches are tasty but small, the desserts are top notch though.  The brownie ice cream sandwich is as good as it gets.  If the sandwiches were bigger would give it a higher rating.The sandwiches were good- mine was the best the "Original", others got the blt and the earl of montegue- just ok.  A lot of hype about this place with zero ambience and zero personality.  It's kind of like an assembly line with a lot of shouting and noise and pretty good sandwiches.  Nothing to write home about.  Their drink selection was quite bad.  The set up is like just get through the line already!!!  Pay me the money!!
It is definitely Not a mom and pop shop, so why not go find one?  Please someone in Vegas find us a good sami shop!!!Their sandwich helped me transition quickly from "HUNGover" to food coma + Family Guy episodes.

It didn't taste very good, but it did the trick at a low price.Mediocre.

Only would go here hungover and in Vegas.This is probably the smallest airport i've ever been to. The rental car area is not well marked, so beware on your first time to return.  It is all the way to the left just before departures.  No worries though,  you just have to loop back around if you miss it the first time, there was barely a soul to be found when I arrived.Food was good. Service was horrible. Waited over an hr for out food on a Thursday. (It was not that busy)
Ben the bartender did make some good drinks.Good find for anyone living in the West Valley or just visitng. Quality is just as good if not better than Starbucks. Coffee is superb and the food is excellent. They even have gelato!

The one problem I have is with their service. They have a restaurant type service, which does not seem to work in their favor. When you sit down, it takes 15 minutes to be greeted and another 30 to get food. In order to avoid this is to order at the counter and then be seated. 

I recommend this place solely for the quality of their coffee and foodIt's Vegas,  they have baby free samples of frozen cocktail! 

I would have to say of all the quick bites held in ph, next to Earls of course would be Fresh Grill! They have a friendly staff and decent bites of sandwich, fresh house chips and all the different types of sauces you want!Had a classic Mojito, which I love but way to much mint(overpowering actually) not worth the 14.00 dollar price tag.Seems like a chain restaurant trying to model itself as a cute Southern BBQ joint, which it is not. Yeah, they give you a big mason jar to drink out of and biscuits with apple butter to start off. I recognized the biscuit but couldn't figure out what the sparkly stuff was on it, which turned out to be sugar. At first I didn't know what the apple butter was. Even after eating it, I later asked the server what was in it. The biscuit was dry and the combo was not Southern style.

Lucilles has Tri-Tip all over their menu. That made me chuckle because if Southerners knew where Tri-Tip originated from, you'd probably get shot. Stick to your Santa Barbara roots Lucille.  

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was delicious!!! My server recommened the Memphis style BBQ sauce and he was right - an excellent combination with the pulled pork.  The fries were nothing to write home about. I would have wanted fried okra with my meal, but that option is only available as an appetizer and not a side order. WTF?

I went for the peach cobbler for desert. I couldn't tell it was made with peaches. It seemed like a sweetened mass with a crumbly topping. Good cobbler is not that hard to make, not sure why the follow through wasn't there. 

I wouldn't mind trying this place again. They smoke their own meats and they did well with my pulled pork. The rest of the meal was a little lacking. If the price for the main dishes weren't higher than giraffe tail, I'd come back again, but sorry Lucilles isn't on my return list.

The staff was friendly and I was able to get a weak wifi signal. Bathrooms were somewhat clean.We came here with low expectations because I had previously read the reviews....we got 2 free buffets upon checking in. It wasn't too bad actually...the pasta station was good and so were the crab legs. Our server was prompt at clearing plates and bringing napkins. The warm mini donuts in the dessert section were yummy and tasted fresh, I'd most likely return here.I was seriously disappointed in my dining experience at Roka. I went with a group of 18 and had arranged to have a fixed menu and reserved the back room. 

The food was as excellent as all of the other reviewers stated. We sampled several rolls, veggies, soup, sashimi, tempura ect.   The place itself big, with modern tasteful décor, and the tables were nicely spread out. They have a huge sushi and robata bar and a lounge to the side with all different seating arrangements. The back room we were placed in was big but intimate enough for our group. Our server was exceptional (his name was Casey) he was quick to offer suggestions and really knew the history of the drinks. If I had a restaurant I would steal him away and put him as head waiter!

So why the 3 stars? Timing, or in this case lack of timing. 

We were seated and brought the first round of rolls before our drink orders had been placed.
We actually received 4 orders of rolls before we received our drinks. 
We were served drinks without sake cups, soups without spoons, rolls without soy or wasabi... 
It was a complete mess. I am sad to say the lack of timing really disappointed us, I would return because the food and service were excellent, but I would not recommend it for big groups.

One more thing - They offered to call us a car service to take us to downtown Scottsdale, telling us the fist 10 miles were free. Once we got in the driver told us it was a minimum charge of $25. They really need more organization.Very expensive and kinda loud in the bar/lounge area.  What's up with sushi places having to blare music these days??

Butterfish Takahi is a must try.  Its like 5 little pieces for like 10 bucks but.. worth it!  The Wagyu burger is salty, but cheap.  I would skip the beef and kimchi dumplings and get a pound and a half frozen at an asian grocery store and make it myself for the same price.  Everything else didn't stand out...  

Eh, won't miss n my happy hour rotation.  Great service though and not as stuffy/snooty as I thought it would be.Oyshi has a delicious and extensive ayce menu, there is no doubt about that. Many of the items are interesting and full of flavor. Some of my favorite items are the Love Affair and Japanese Lasagna rolls as well as the beef wrapped asparagus and sizzling ribeye. The quality and creativity of their menu items deserves praise. For example, the cucumber salad isn't the typical you would get at another sushi spot, they have a peanuty sauce laid on top that really individualizes it from the standard version of the dish. All that being said, I still would not say that dinner there should be several dollars higher than other ayce sushi places. 

First of all, the service at Oyshi stinks, to put it plainly. Don't get me wrong, the staff is pleasant and at times can even be friendly. However, the food just comes out way too slowly. Other sushi restaurants really leave Oyshi crying in the dust when it comes to this. On top of that, they definitely pull the "always filling up your drink" technique to get us full. This just doesn't give your party a lot of room to appreciate all of the items they offer simply because your appetite duration can only hold out for so long.

Secondly, the dessert choices are outstanding, BUT you are limited to one special dessert! Their desserts are the best I've seen so far at a sushi place, but oh my goodness, for $26 dinners, I personally think we should be allowed to try them all one time each, at the very least! I am in love with the green tea tiramisu and the green tea crème brûlée. The fruit parfait is also very tasty, anything but disappointing.

For these reasons, I award Oyshi three stars. Their food makes them a great establishment, but I strongly feel they need cater better to the customers.Unorganized chaos!  For a movie that has been out for month!  Hmmm!  But nice place. This place is decent for movies.

a.  Ambiance - Great lobby, food area, place to hang out before a movie starts - 5 star.

b.  Parking - You are at a casino and have to walk a long way to get to the theater. You will need to give yourself time to get there  - 3 star

c.  Service - On July 4, what a mess. They had a lot of people at one time and the line was forming near the escalator which is a huge fire and safety hazard. Finally they got staff to fix this, but at the expense of pushing people around in line and doing this commando style and not with any organization or coolness to it.  - 1 star

d.  Eats - Beside your standard flavors, they have one of those great coke machines that can do a huge variety of mixed coke products. Way cool.  Also, at the bottom of the elevator is the Steak and Shake place. At 5:00 pm on July 4, for about 10 minutes, no line. amazing. 5 star

e.  Theater - They have a huge theater for high def movies, and a  lot of smaller movies. I saw a movie in their smallest theater and it was rink dink. I think it is almost same as watching it on netflix. Spacing between the seats is tight for both shoulder room and leg room. Not a lot of thought went into this theater when you compare it to Rave (AMC 18) or Galaxy. 2 star

I have seen a few movies here and do not plan to come back really. It is just that the positives do not outweigh the negatives. There are plenty of places that have better seating and screen sizes.

However, if you like to be at Southpoint, and down to your last 8.00 during the day, this is a place to check out to pass the time away with your blockbuster movies!I've been here one time. I plan to go back and take on the 1 1b challenge. I was happy with my burger and side items. Was this best burger/fries I've ever had no, but was pretty good.

The variety of shake combinations is great 

Nice location, service was good, not great.This is a review of the bar only..I have eaten here and it is hit or miss don't get the stone crabs very weak, over priced..We show up to the bar and get a seat..Service is very spotty..Wine by the glass expensive and not worth while.  how about some good half bottle choices?  The band that night, a nice 3 piece outfit very good..but then we are treated to a very drunk, strange bald guy who takes the mike.  I only point out that he is bald in case you see him there..he is a regular and "Clean" as he was known in college does not disappoint.  He comes and makes a fool of himself, and the staff accept it as he tips everyone so they let this drunk slide.  In the meantime he is whopping and all over the place..Nice! If you are over 40 this is a good spot for sure.  If all this is not enough the worst kept secret here is that the bar after 10pm has hookers..It is fun to watch old guys(I'm 38) 50+ make time with the bevy of women for hire..Again the staff accept this as it does bring in their demographic of wealthy older gentlemen and just so you know I am not complaining just pointing it out for the viewer.  I accept everyone ad if this is how you make a living fine by me.  I just think it odd in a semi-classy place they would allow it that's all.  I guess with all the competition now you gotta have a hook(or hooker!)My friends came to Las Vegas and wanted to eat here for lunch. She said that there is only 1 CAPRIOTTI'S in CA (where shes from), which is located in Beverly Hills. Luckily, theres Caps all over town in LV. This gave me the perfect opportunity to try out their Bobbie.

I never had a traditional " Thanksgiving..in your mouth.." type of sandwich before, so I didn't know what to expect. This cold sub had layers of home-made turkey meat, sweet cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo spread. 

-I'm never a big fan of cold subs.
-My family doesn't have turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce during Thanksgiving. So I guess I didn't know how to appreciate the sub.
-The combination of cold turkey, sweet cranberry sauce, cold soft/soggy stuffing..was just okay. I wasn't wowed or felt like I tasted a bit of heaven or anything.

I think this sub is suited for someone else that knows how to appreciate traditional American Thanksgiving. Everyone I know says this sub is really good. Its just too bad it wasn't for me.Hard for me to give this place a straight forward rating: Used to eat at the rainbow location a handful of years back, and both have went down in quality from what I remember, and up in price. Not saying the quality is low, but that I remember it to be amazing, and now its ''good.'' I eat thai often, and will go here for a safe and sure meal. Just remember what it was and how it is now, so I have to give it 3. ( Really wish the curry portions were larger)  : ) Still good food.Wings were just what the Doctor ordered. We ordered honey BBQ and buffalo, along with an order of carrots and celery. Try the mini corn dogs yum! Server was polite however drinks and check took quite a long time to receive and I go to B dubs all around the country and this location is far darker then all others, felt a little creepy. If
you into that, this is your place, just not for me.We've been here twice now & both times were just okay. Very noisy place! We prefer Oregano's better...portions are heartier there.  (Sorry, Aiello lovers). ps....At least at Oregano's, they show old time classic movies instead of the usual football game on their TV's...Let's leave football games to the Sports Bars, not at a nice italian restaurant.Great Atmosphere, Average Food

It was a beautiful Sunday night, not too hot or too cool, so my boyfriend and I thought we'd try out Margaritaville.  We sat outside which created a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere.  The music was catchy, the nearby fountain was relaxing, and the architecture was unique.  

The food however was only okay.  As a main course I had chicken and broccoli pasta, while my partner had teriyaki steak.  I enjoyed my entree , but it's somewhat hard to mess up chicken pasta.  The chicken was slightly dry, but the garlic sauce helped that some.

My boyfriend didn't like his steak at all.  He thought the taste was too strong, and when I tasted the meat I thought it was kind of limp/rubbery.  It came with mash potatoes, and while they looked real, they tasted like instants.  

The boy and I are buffalo wing fans, but the ones we had as an appetizer were only okay.  They didn't offer a boneless option, and that meant that the wings were short on actual meat.  We weren't offered a choice of dressing, so we ended up with ranch even though buffalo wings are known for being served with blue cheese.

We did however have great drinks.  I had a strawberry margarita that was well-mixed.  My boyfriend tried the Big Rita and liked it a lot.  
We especially like that they let you take home the cup as a souvenir.

The service was a little slow but not too bad.  Our server was friendly and polite.  

At the end of the meal we were surprised to see a bill of over $70--which stretched to around $80 once we added the tip.  I don't mind paying that much for a good meal, but we had thought our food was only average.  In the end we decided not to return to Margaritaville because it was a lot of money for food that was only okay.The kids play area - 
Alright..if your kids are extremely mobile.  Quite a few bigger kids plowing around and knocking into the younger ones.  Baby C just started walking the other week, so he's still really wobbly on his feet at times (imagine a baby t-rex stomping about..That's Baby C walking..lol).  I kept worrying that these older kids (7-10 year olds) running around like crazy heathens were going to run Baby C right over.  

SERIOUSLY PARENTS OF OLDER KIDS  - CONTROL YOUR DEMON SPAWN (or better yet...GET THEM OUT OF THE KIDDIE AREA)!!

The food court - 
Hardly any A/C running in that area or at least you cant really feel it.  So be prepared to sweat during the summertime when eating your Paradise Bacon Turkey Bravo sandwich or Panda Express Orange Chicken.For some reason, Phoenix and Scottsdale are grossly lacking on breakfast joints. Can someone please explain this to me?

They did a great job with Over Easy. The food is always good, as is the service.

I like the Pollo Loco.I had the 24 hour pass for the seven buffets, and since I was staying at this hotel, it was convenient that I ate here for breakfast.

It's a typical breakfast buffet, with all your regular breakfast food. Nothing struck me as out of the ordinary. If you want decent, endless breakfast food to start off the day, go here!We caught the end of lunch and the beginning supper. The salad and soup portion was good. The dessert bar was outstanding. It was almost as long as the hot food bar. 
The hot bar was ok but the weakest area. King crab legs were cold. Boiled shrimp real good. Fried chicken was only fair. 
Our server, Jose, was very proficient.
We had a great table with a view of the paradise garden with birds, fish etc was very nice. 
We would do it again.Sushi is ok! Nothing fancy. Most rolls, even their specialty rolls are very basic. I prefer multiple types of fish and sauces on my sushi. The teriyaki chicken looked very good. It was nice to save a few dollars on the sushi during happy hour!Nice place to buy books but I don't know if it's a nice place to hangout and study Just because it's connected to the mall but overall it's alright for buying books.I'm only giving 3 stars because at these prices I expect to be wowed and I was not. I've never seen a wine list so ridiculous in my life. Maybe 2 bottles under $100, most well over $300. This was a business dinner so we had a wide variety of very pricey appetizers, meats, cheeses, foie, all of which underwhelmed and certainly not worth the price. My filet was simple but good. The pasta prices were also ridiculous with the entree sizes at about $50 each.2 colleagues had these and they were fine, not great. The sides were all underwhelming, cauliflower, beets, potatoes. This was not  as good as CUT, Stripsteak, or Craftsteak and the menu certainly was no where close to any of these others.I had an enjoyable lunch here with Rand H. and Mike C. the other day.  Indian Paradise has a very nice lunch buffet with a variety of authentic Indian cuisine items   to choose from.   

Restaurant~ very clean and inviting.  It's not a large restaurant but it has plenty of room for multiple groups. The service is OK, not bad but not great either.   

Food~ we started with some soup and salad.  They had one soup, tomato soup on the day we went.  It was OK and so was the salad. They bring fresh pita bread to your table.  Some with garlic and herbs, which was very nice.  They had several dishes to choose, some with curry and without.  The Chicken curry was very good and so was their Paneer's.  I was looking forward to the Tandoori Chicken and their Chicken Tikka Marsala, but the chicken had a sparse odor of benzene so it was not tasty. They also had roasted jalapeno's with black salt, which I think is an acquired taste ~ not for me.  

All in all, some of their food tasted very good and some not so good. Most everything is a bit mushy so you will need to start at the rice cooker or get a bunch of bowls.  This is a very good place to try some Indian cuisine if you're in the area.Not great, certainly not bad.

I've heard their fresh guacamole is excellent but it's pricey. (I haven't tried it yet).

Their lunch specials are great. I love their green chille pork burrito, their salsa and chips are really good, Their burrito was just ok. Their soup is SO yummmy 

Service is VERY nice and REALLY fast 

They are a little pricey though on their regular menu.I just love mariachis! The food could've been horrible, the service could've sucked, and I still would have had a great dinner. But it didn't. As always, we had a fantastic dinner with guac made tableside, wonderful fideo soup, tasty salsa, and unlimited bean dip! 

I do feel the menu is a bit pricy and excellent Mexican food can be found elsewhere for half the price, but being serenaded with Cielito Lindo while sipping on a margarita makes for one unforgettable night! 

Lindo has somewhat of a cult following and my cult friends get angry when I say that Lindo ain't all that - but I honestly don't believe it's the best Mexican restaurant in town. 

Their lunch menu is a better value, so if you've heard the hype about how awesome this place is, you can get a decent lunch, drink included for around $10.We'd heard of Breadfruit and decided to stop by before 1st Friday last week. The design/decor is fresh, colorful, and simple in a trendy kind of way. The waitstaff is incredibly friendly and attentive and the kitchen is exposed so you can see your food being prepared. They have traditional Caribbean drinks and fresh squeezed carrot juice with coconut and ginger. The avocado/chicken spring rolls are tasty, but could use a little more spice. For dinner, the chicken dumpling is delicious (well, the chicken is), but the jerk shrimp plate is a bit sparse and overpriced for what you get. Overall, we liked it and we'll be going back again to try some more dishes. This time we'll be sure to BYOB!Ok, so after the scathing initial review, I went back. The food's just that good. 

Service was MUCH better than my first visit. Granted, I've had better service at 3:00am in the Jack in the Box drive-thru than I got the first time around at Blue Adobe. It HAD to be better.  Not great service, but acceptable.The best rolls I have ever had, but that was about it. I had the chicken with vegetable couscous and it wasnt anything special. I was part of a party of 5 and none of us were too happy with our entrees. The Calamari tasted like it should have been in a mexican restaurant and the pork inside of the spring rolls was way too hard, probably cause it was old.Table 10 was a suitable restaurant for a business meal with 4 colleagues.  While it was quite good, there was nothing about the meal that screamed outstanding.  For the price of the meal, something should have really jumped out.

As a beginning course, I had a salad with "Salt Roasted Beets."  The salad was arugula, feta cheese, pistachios and the aforementioned beets, with a barely discernible vinaigrette.  While there was nothing wrong with the salad, as I said in the opening, it did not wow me in any way...just a solid preparation of a decent salad.

The entree was a Braised Lamb Shank with Pumpkin Risotto.  The lamb shank was done well, but it could have used a bit more seasoning, as I had to add salt and pepper to bring out the flavors.  The risotto was prepared well, but there was no pumpkin flavor to it.

Service, as expected, was quite good.When the folks are in town, I find myself in search of the best deal in town.  Prime rib was on the menu and Fremont Street was where we were at.

Binion's was offering a $7.95 prime rib when you sign up for their casino card, so of course that's what we did.

I must admit, for under eight bucks you get a pretty decent meal.  You get soup or salad to start, 10 oz. slice of prime rib, a baked potato, and string beans.  The prime rib was surprisingly tasty too, with a nice crust on the outside.
 
Service was okay, it's a coffee shop after all and they are busy at night.  Beers were lukewarm instead of ice cold, which isn't so nice when you've been on a bus all day long.

Overall, an eight dollar prime rib dinner can't be beat. You're not paying for gourmet here, just a chunky size piece of meat!  They also had a few other specials that had our heads turning - spaghetti and meatball special, etc.

Their daily Blue Plate Specials go for $7.99 from 11 am to 10 pm and ranges from a Turkey Dinner on Sundays to a Fried Seafood Platter on Fridays and Corned Beef and Cabbage on Saturdays.

Open 24 hours.We went here for Valentines Day 2 yrs ago- there was a set 3 course meal and it was OK - Let's just say after that visit we never cared to go back...
On a whim we drove past it and decided it was time to give La Focaccia another try...
The service is just too slow, I know this is a small place but they need a waitress and a cook that can work at a faster pace, I mean we do have other things to do other than wait for out food!!!
O.K. my pasta was really good- I would come back again for my pasta-
I had the Penne Americiana bit replaced Penne for Angel Hair Pasta- the dish had Pancetta, Onion, Tomato Sauce,Chili Flakes and Parmigiano...It was really good- because of the Pancetta I could see how it may be too salty for some but I liked it alot!!!!
My daughter had Spaghetti al Pomodoro-I tried it - Good!!!!
The BF had Ravioli Burro e Salvia- Good but he had to ask for more Tomato Sauce and he was still hungry after the fact...
At one point I had to get up and ask again for the tomato sauce as the BF's food was getting cold just waiting for the extra sauce- I'm telling you the slow pace in here is just ridiculous!!!!
For the appetizer we ordered the Bruschetta which in the menu said $4.95 but I was charged $9.95 come to find out I was mistakingly given the wrong bruschetta appetizer- 
The Bruschetta was different because your bread was dry and you added either tomatoes,olives or garlic. I liked it, I loved the whole garlic cloves!!!
So just like the name of this place= Focaccia= I was wondering where our focaccia was (each table is supposed to be given focaccia on the house) but if I didn't ask I wouldn't have gotten any so just ask people... (The waitress said she didn't bring us any because she was waiting for the focaccia to be warm then she would've brought it out) I didn't believe her, I mean we were already almost done with our meal. The Focaccia itself was chewy goodness!!!
The Italian BF wasn't impressed, the Kid and I liked our food so sorry BF majority rules and I think we will be back but I'd have to make sure that  I have nothing else planned for the rest of the day- yes, it may take that long....
AnywaysThank goodness for being an Express renter.

My line only had 3 people in it vs the 20 in the lobby.

My only complaint and hence the 3 stars was the car.  Now I know I didn't have to choose the one I did, but it was a mustang.  And why would I choose a PT cruiser over a mustang?  I am not mental.  So, BF and I squeezed all our luggage in just fine.  It wasn't til I was driving off that I noticed the car need a good detailing and it had 34000 miles on it.  Needed power steering fluid to boot.

The attendent did mark the car up when we got back so hopefully the next group to get our fun little mustang we have a better experience.

This dollar is not nearly as bad as the LAX one, so I will not complain.This is my 2nd try and probably my last. The first time I played it safe & just ordered Chicken teriyaki, it was ok. Not great, not bad, just ok. A little on the bland side, not much teriyaki flavor. 

Today I ordered Mongolian beef & mongolian chicken.  I redeemed my Yelp coupon for two free egg rolls. They actually gave me 4 egg rolls & 2 crab puffs. 

The egg rolls looked different than any egg roll I've ever had & tasted different. Don't know what to say. The crab puff was ok. The red sauce is watery. 

Both Mongolians were spicy hot and again lacking in flavor. Plenty of heat no flavor. The beef was a bit on the tough side. 

It's so disappointing!! I very much was hoping that we finally had a good Chinese food restaurant in Surprise. 

I'm going to San Fran in a couple of weeks. I'll have to get my fill of Chinese there!I liked it and will definitely go back.  Good food, good atmosphere.  Not the friendliest of service on a very busy Sunday morning.  The guy taking our order was very distracted.***TIPS***

- This is the closest location to the main vegas strip
- Don't come between 10pm to midnight, you might have to wait 30 minutes for your food. Its faster to do drive through during these hours.
- Go after midnight if eating there.Food is okay. Some of their dishes are good and others are mediocre. They are 24 hours so that's a plus. Service is great though!Came here because our friend wanted to see the weekly "poetry slam". I like that it's family owned and that they have really cheap specials like 2 slices and a 20 oz drink for $5.95. The downside was that they don't seem to have a lot of kitchen staff so it took awhile to get our food. They even forgot my friend's order and said they couldn't give a refund. Kudos to them for making her a special personal pan sized pizza and gave her a free brownie too =) Pizza was tasty, a little on the greasy side though. 

Poetry slam was cool, lots of interesting characters. I think I would come back here for fun since the downtown area is kind of cute. But it's kind of a far drive for me to get pizza. I got to be a judge at the poetry slam. I guess if you give any score less than a 9.0, even if you don't really like the performance, people in the audience will boo you as a judge. Oh well, if I went up there, I probably wouldn't get more than a 5, so who am I to judge artI will have to admit that the place was inexpensive close to Desert Ridge.  It's tucked away in a strip mall in between a couple of office complexes.  The price for an two eggs over-easy, country potatoes, and onion-toasted bagel with coffee is a little less than $6.  The food was okay, and the coffee woke me up.  My friend had a turkey sandwich and it was alright.  Her dad had the same breakfast with me, but wanted the country fries that was not available.  You need to beat out that breakfast rush.  It was a little busy that morning.  Service was quick, friendly, and efficient.  There aren't many selection of food outfits for breakfast around the area.  I will return to this eatery.I have visited Sushi Samba twice now and the more look back on it, the more I regret going there. The food there was good (not great), and the prices here are ridiculous. 

Miso Marinated Sea Bass: The Sea Bass was the sized of my fist (no bigger). The flavors and texture of the Sea bass was great. I really enjoyed this dish, but for a tiny piece of fish priced at $29. It's not going to satisfy many and one might change theirr mind about sharing because of the small portions. If you want to add a side of rice it will set you back another $5!  
--- 3.5 / 5 Stars

Salt & Pepper Squid: Nothing out of the ordinary. Portion was small once again. $14 
--- 2.5 / 5 Stars

Maya Roll - The sushi itself wasn't that great, but the salsa was quite tasty. $11 
--- 3 / 5 Stars

BoBo Brazil - Probably the tastiest roll here. The addition of kobe beef was great. Small portions once again. $17
--- 4 / 5 Stars

As you can see for the price you're paying here, you can easily select another restaurant (especially if you're ok with eating outside the Venetian).

If you're staying at the Venetian I recommend eating at Delmonico Steakhouse (Bone-in Ribeye)AJs is a really nice high-end grocery store but it is WAAAAY overpriced. I visited this location with my niece and all she got was a sandwich and a piece of fruit and it was $14! Shame on me for paying it when I could have made the same exact thing at home for a fraction of that. 

I visit AJs semi-frequently because they sell my favorite BBQ sauce: Sting 'N Linger Ghost Pepper BBQ sauce. When I go there, the employees are always nice and professional and they always have my item in stock.I came here for dinner and had ordered the wedge salad, tomahawk ribeye, and the sauteed wild mushrooms.  The wedge salad was pretty good.  I was sharing it, and they kindly split it before bringing it to the table.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare.  The two sauces that they served with it were both kind of one toned.  I felt like I needed something acidic.  The mushrooms were also good.

I saw the table next to me order the hot rocks.  If you're not good with chipsticks, this is probably not the appetizer for you.  The stone is so hot and the slices of meat so thin that you basically only really need to put the meat on to take it off right away.Been there a few times now & it's good, my woman likes it a lot more than myself. Me, I prefer Diamond China........anyhow China Mama is a good restaurant & I say try it you might like it more than ME!!! Also it's a little pricey.The good:
Great service, friendly staff
Tasty, well cooked pizza crust, sauce & ingredients
Good variety of pizza toppings
Delish salad

The bad:
Skimpy on the pizza toppings

I got a no-cheese pizza with red pizza sauce, basil, broccoli, crimini mushrooms & tomato. The pizza was cooked well and the crust was crunch, crispy & tasty, they've got it down! Topping were definitely skimpy though. When someone orders a no cheese pizza, you gotta hook up the toppings! I wound up combining toppings from 3 different slices on to 1 just to get enough coverage.

My wife got a chopped salad with a delicious vinagrette dressing that she really enjoyed.

Vegans should avoid the red pasta sauce and the tomato soup, as they both include cream. The red pizza sauce & crust is vegan.It's Chipotle.  I mean what else can you say that hasn't already been said? This location is always busy no matter when you come, but the food is good (albeit it is getting expensive) and the service has been good. Just remember, get to this location early if you want to eat and be able to sit, otherwise you are out of luck!The salsa was good. The fish tacos were kinda boring. Needs a zesty creamy sauce. Also, it was about 30% more expensive than it should have been. Service was iffy.First Pool/Day Club experience in Vegas. I think it was about $70 and Tiesto was playing that day. There was a cut off time of 1pm so my friends and I made sure to get there on time. We got in and the place was packed. Even though it was a fun and unique experience, I don't think I will be going to any Pool/Day Clubs anymore for a few reasons: 

1. It is pricey.. Can't afford going out during the day, blow Benjamins at casinos, and go out at night again to blow some more.

2. Can't hang: Getting old so I get tired easily haha

3. Not my thing: I rather go to night clubs honestly.Found this place a few weeks ago on Yelp, as I just moved to the area.

Plus: Decent variety of sushi on the conveyor belt. Inexpensive (generally $1-2 per plate); portions are not surprisingly small, but it gives you the chance to try a lot of things. Love the baked mussels. They have small sides, like udon soup, for only a few bucks to round out your meal.

Minus: Not much space at the counter, especially with stacks of empty plates and lids in the way. Service is somewhat inattentive; can take awhile to get drinks or a soy sauce bowl with wasabi (they should just have these on the conveyor). I always feel like I'm inconveniencing them when I ask for something. Sometimes have to ask for certain items to be refilled when they're low on the belt; if you like something, grab it while you can because it might not be there the next time around!

My biggest complaint about this place is it's always crowded. Even at 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon, the counter will be completely full. The restaurant is a good size, but they seem to keep half of it closed (including half the conveyor belt) to crowd everyone into a small space where the sushi chefs work. Out of 4 times I've been there, only once was the other part open and they were in the processing of closing it down. Tonight I came in around 6:15 and there were 15 people waiting and only half the restaurant being used. We ended up leaving; very frustrating, because they have the space and refuse to use it.Heard about it through the grapevine and figured, why the heck not?  We went on a Tuesday evening just after 6pm and waited about 5 minutes to be seated.  We were seated in the VERY LAST BOOTH you could get from the conveyor belt, so that sucked rocks as everything had been picked over.  Still, food was decent.  Spicy tuna was nice and spicy, the tempura roll was still hot from the fryer and the veggie rolls were very crisp and delicious.  The cream puffs were frozen solid and never defrosted.  Didn't get to try any of the salads, but the seaweed salad looked phenomenal.  We weren't given plates to lay our chopsticks on, so we grabbed some empty ones from the conveyor belt as it was hard (being in the corner booth) to get anyone's attention.  They turned OFF the conveyor belt while we were still sitting and munching at our table so a waitress finally walked over and said that if we needed anything to go through her.  Then she disappeared, walking throughout the restaurant.  She was nice....but never came back to us, until we asked for our bill then she got a little bit snotty with *why did we take the plates off the conveyor belt*.  

Because we were never given any plates to put our chopsticks on and we didn't want to just lay them on the table or on the dirty plates.  So, they were a little miffy about it since there were drinks or snacks that we could have been charged for (but again, any *normal* person would notice there was an empty snack/soda/juice container on the table to correspond with the empty plate--duh).  

I can see how this place would fill up fast and could get insanely crowded.  I just didn't like the fact that they TURNED OFF THE CONVEYOR BELT while we were still sitting and eating--that's a sure sign of them not so subtly saying "Please leave".  Really felt like they tried to rush the two last tables on that side of the room OUT the door so they could clean and close up that portion of the restaurant.  I didn't enjoy that.  

IT was a little bit loud in there--reminded me of 90's pop rock sung in Japanese--cute, but annoying.  Definitely could have been turned WAY DOWN.I'm not exactly sure how to rate Teharu....

PROS-
Cheap sushi, You can order anything, Service is pretty good, not too long of a wait, they have eel sauce on the table!

CONS-
 the occasional food poisoning.


My advice is to keep a keen eye on how many times a certain dish goes around, NEVER take the last piece, order most dishes through the waiter/waitress.We ate here for the first time on a Friday night. It was busy but we were able to get a table right away. After we were seated, we waited for about 20 minutes until we were helped. I think there were circumstances that made some of their wait staff unavailable for a bit but it was still unfortunate. Once we ordered, our food took a little while to come out. The food itself was pretty good. I wasn't crazy about my soup but my husband's noodle dish was good and our friend's Pad Thai was excellent. Because of the service issue, I'm not sure we would go out of our way to return here. Overall, it was an ok experience.I give Pink spot three stars for a mixed experience. 

The boy had a vanilla milkshake that was out of this world delicious, but my coffee ice cream tasted weird and left me cold. (no pun intended) It's pretty sad when the best part of the ice cream cone is the out-of-a-box mass produced cone. 

I am not a big ice cream person anyway so I suppose one could assume that my experience was directly related to that, but I don't think it was. The staff had no idea what they were doing (note: train staff prior to putting them on shifts all by themselves) and I thought the prices were a little on the steep side for the quality of the product. 

They do, however, get a few bonus points: 
+1 for a fairly cute decor
+1 for having chocolate covered frozen bananas. I hate the things, but it isn't something you'll find at most ice cream joints.The service is awesome but the food not so much. The food is plain compared to most other Mexican places, or my house haWe have been here a few times now. Sorry to say this was the worst we have experienced.
It was a Tuesday night, about 8:30pm. Not too busy when we got there. We had to say hello to the hostess, she just said later, how you doing, (2). She never said follow me,or is this table alright. Just put our menus down and said enjoy!

When our Server Rachel came up,she was alright,she brought us our drinks right away.  We waited quite awhile for our food, the manager finally brought it out to us.
Then asked if we needed anything. Both of our drinks were empty.
We asked for refills.Rachel brought them. About 15 min or more later she came by to ask if we liked our food. My girlfriend had ordered hers well done,it was still very pink in the middle. They offered to re do she declined. We all know never send food back. She said no it is OK, I just want you to see it is not cooked.
Mine was cooked all the way through. Even though I had ordered Medium.

Anyway, then the manager came by again. Though did not introduce himself as the manager at any time. We found out from Rachel that he was. Again he offered a re cook. She declined and said no ,it is fine. I will take it home to the dog.

He offered to take it off the bill.
We still never got another refill of drinks, we were dying of thrist so could hardly wait to get home and get some water or out to the car where we had water bottles.
Lots of milling around by the employees,but not too much going on on the floor.
We were really disappointed about this visit.This place seem small and a bit confusing. Its in an area that you usually won't find a sit down restaurant. I guess its an okay location, but it looks like a place would be fitting for retail stores like Radio Shack or GNC. Doesn't really fit very well, but it is a nice place. 

Inside was a bit decent, a bit roomy and seems clean. When we did get to our booth, we did find it odd that one side is roomy then the other side of the booth. 

The staff seem kind of nice. The one who sat us down in our booth, didn't seem to happy. But the waitress that took our order was upbeat. The busser on the other hand, had issues. I'm sure there are a softer way to put dishes in a bucket, instead of making clanging sounds, to the point where it irritates our ears and makes us twitch every time he drops a plate in the bucket. So that was kind of annoying, either he doesn't know how to be gentle with dishes, or he's not really happy that he has to make the dishes clang and make us twitch. Uncool, unprofessional, and uncalled for. 

The only thing that's making this okay, is the food, the nice setting and the waitress being nice. Otherwise I would of probably experience better if the staff look like they didn't want to work. 

The food on the other hand, I really enjoyed. Had the steak and eggs and cooked to my satisfaction. So I give the cooks a very good recognition as well. 

I guess, if you don't mind some of the staff being unhappy and there for the food. Then I would recommend it. Otherwise, I would try something else, if you want to be in a more upbeat kind of place that won't make you feel uncomfortable.I have to admit that the food I was served was actually pretty good. The problem here was the service, or shall I say lack of. 

I went to this place with a group of 8 (which included 3 kids) and it seemed although we made a reservation they clearly had no idea how to handle us. We arrived a few minutes before our scheduled reservation and were placed at a table by ourselves, with no drinks or anything, other than an apology that they were really busy. DUH! It was a Saturday night, and isn't that the reason people make reservations??? The restaurant was packed and it seemed that the staff were quite overwhelmed. We finally were escorted to our table (that we would eat at) about 30 minutes after arriving. One of the men in our group had decided to get us drinks at the bar, which helped ease the frustration. We ordered off the table menu as well as 4 rolls from the sushi bar. The cook was very entertaining, mixing it up with the kids and displaying his skills. The meal was very good, but after the final entree was served, I managed to flag down our waitress to ask about the sushi rolls. It turns out she had forgotten to turn in the order, and we were told it would take another 30 minutes to get to ours if she turned it in at that point. Of course we opted to nix the sushi rolls, but what a disappointment!!!! (I love sushi) 

I really wanted this place to wow me, because it's soooo close to my house. I might return again with fewer people, and maybe on a weekday to avoid the long wait time (even with a reservation.)Decidedly average. Then again just about anything within the "Westgate Triangle"  seems to fit that.  E.g you eat there because you are there for some other event.   

El Paso bbq schools them on the beans, ribs and sauce and for roughly the same per person cost.  I believe Famous Dave's , least the one in Yuma beats them handily, as does Honey bears, as does RUB bbq etc. 

 Not that Shane's is  bad it's just there's nothing that stands out.You order on the way in, busy, noisy and hard to wrangle a toddler when the in/ out and ordering location are in the same place.  Food arrives reasonably quickly but plastic utensils and ribs do not mix, let's not even try :)  I want to give it 2.5 because there's just too many places I'd drive for this kind of meal for the same price in nice surroundings. 

I miss Shoney's back in Ga , heck I miss most of the rib places I frequented in GA but alas the furthest west they've gotten is New Mexico.I went here last night with a party of 4.  The place was pretty busy for 7pm on a Wednesday night so luckily I made a reservation and we were seated promptly.

The service was very friendly and helpful but pretty unattentive.  This was probably because there were way to many tables with way too many people and not enough waiters/waitresses/servers.  There were only 3 people  plus the cook(s) doing everything and they were clearly overwhelmed.

The other thing I didn't like was the menu.  It had far too many choices.  There were probably 200+ dishes on the thing.  So we basically gave up and everyone ordered a different kind of dish so we could all share.  We ended up getting a chicken dish, a shrimp dish, a vegetarian dish, and some sort of meat sampler thing.  We also ordered an appetizer sampler thing, some rice and some naan.

Everything was very good and full of unique flavors.  I've never been to India and have only eaten Indian food 3 other times, but I thought the food here was very good.  The only problem with it was the price.  It was ridiculously priced for what you get.  The actual portion size is actually pretty good, but charging $15 for 5 shrimp or 5 pieces of lamb is ridiculous.  It is even more ridiculous because nothing comes with sides.  Everything is a la carte.  My wife got some kind of meat sampler (which came out a full 10 minutes before the rest of our meals) and it was laughable that it was $20. 

Anyway, this place pretty much robs you.  Luckily we had a certificate from Local Dines - http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ - which lessened the blow a bit but I was still pissed.  So, if you must go, get the certificate and you'll be glad you did.Never heard of this burger chain but I guess they have locations in a bunch of major cities. Waited in line (?) to be seated. Clearly you can see open tables and I don't know if the hostesses (yes plural) just didn't have their act together or they like to stagger the seating to help out the wait staff and kitchen or what? Sorry slow service is one of pet peeves. Took a while for our big group of 8 to decide and order. So many choices and a lot of us were enamored by the alcoholic shakes. Yeah I know, it's the first time I've ever seen milkshakes with alcohol too. I tried some of my friend's shake that had kaluha and baileys and while the alcohol wasn't very strong, the milkshake was delicious. But service during the meal was ok. Water was refilled regularly and they checked up on us a couple times. Anyways I got the lamb tandoori burger. I like to get lamb when I see it because it's one of those things I don't know how to make at home. Think they cook the burgers medium unless you tell them otherwise. And medium is perfect. The burger was just a little bit pink and still very juicy. Also got a side of sweet potato fries. Mmm, love me some sweet potatoes. Dislike that sides don't come with the already expensive burgers ($12+ and $5 for the fries and like $8/9 for milkshakes - insane). Too pricey for me to eat here normally. But when you're on vacation, I guess it's not bad.Market Bistro offers homemade soups, salads, and really fresh sandwiches. I liked the modern decor, staff, and clientele. Very casual - a great lunch spot... (the sandwiches are really big - try splitting one).The place
Beautiful interior, can't complain about that.  I'm sure the other reviewers probably do more justice to the description.

The food
The food was tasty, but not outstanding.  The first thing I tried to order was some kind of sandwich with turkey - which I was told was no longer on the menu, hmm.  If it's not on the menu, then why is it on the menu?

The bottom line
A bit pricy but the quality was above average so not too bad.  Dinged one star for out of date menu.This place is convenient, being in the same shopping center as LVAC, and I do appreciate the 10% discount for LVAC members. However, I found it to be pretty darn overpriced. When I came in, I felt like the salesperson was pretty pushy and I was pressured into buying something that I wasn't sure if I really wanted.  I actually left it in my car, unopened, because I felt uneasy.

The next day, I went to return it, and before walking in, saw that returns were only for store credit. I was all set to be super irritated, but the sales clerk was very nice and went ahead and refunded my money.  For that reason, Freddie's is okay by me.Awesome food, I would rate the taste of food as better than Thai basil. Staffs over weekend are not friendly. And I don't prefer this place for A-la-carte but best for the weekday lunch combos.For now, three stars because it was my first time and there was an hour wait time for a medium/large room, then after we got the room 20 minutes later the machine just stopped.  Supposed cause is that there were too many people in the room ~ maybe it was just that night however I had a great time with friends and we're coming back again this Saturday.  Hopefully it will be a better experience.I highly recommend going to Vegas during the week, any week in the winter months.  No one is there and if you're young and beautiful like me you can most likely get free passes to clubs.  It probably helps also if you're with your physical therapy friends who are 75% women.  

Lavo is the new club/lounge/restaurant at the Palazzo.  For those of you who don't speak Latin.. or Spanish, lavo means to clean yourself and that's certainly what I wanted to do after paying 18 dollars for my glass of Hennessy.  You can bet I made sure that glass lasted all night.  I shouldn't complain though, that's pretty much the going rate for any cocktail in a Vegas club.  

The best part about this place was the music.  The night we went there was a solid DJ playing all the hits.  Much better than the house lover at XS the night before.  This club is also popular with the older folks.  Or maybe they only come out on weekdays.  Maybe it's like senior discount day at the movies except this is a club.  I dunno.The club is pretty small, and the crowd was pretty lame. Some creepers in the area! We had hookups in Vegas and particularly at this club. We got free table service, and the two people that served us were really nice, so props to them.Not quite the A-List crowd like the one in NYC, but it did the job.

Nice looking venue (but what venue ISN'T nice looking in Vegas?), though not quite as impressive as TAO (that room is just incredible looking, but with a shitty crowd.)

The girls were very drunk and very friendly, though I must admit not so to every guy. LOL

I couldnt tell you anything about the restaurant, but the drink prices were quite reasonable compared to Manhattan.I gave LAVO a terrible review the first time visited, but after this night, it's a pretty nice club (when it's not full). The promoters and bouncers outside were really nice, and dressed beautifully, pocket square and all. The club itself is kind of small, and the dance floor is tiny. LOTS OF GUYS. I was surrounded by guys at one point in the night and I decided to make my escape to the bar area. 

I won a contest and got a pair of tickets + drinks to see Cosmic Gate play here. Unfortunately, or fortunately, there were a handful of high ranking DJs at the other clubs, so Lavo was a bit empty. The girls and I had a space to sit while we're tired, and didn't need to fight to get the bartender's attention. The free drink tickets kept on coming! 

Too bad for Cosmic Gate, the dance floor emptied around 2am, and I was able to go up all the way to the booth. Around that time the managers probably got the hint and turned on the lights. Poor CG, I still love you!I was fairly unimpressed with Sweet Tomatoes as I had high expectations. I just recently went for my first time after hearing some great things about it.

The food was not bad, but it also seemed pretty basic. The salads, soups and pastas were far less than the outstanding dishes I thought they would be. For that reason I thought that this place was much more expensive than it should have been. I probably would only come here again if I found a really good value coupon.The food was good but not great service. Our server came back twice to ask our drink order because she kept forgetting. I think it is great for the servers who have great memories but it will ALWAYS make me nervous when they dont write things down.Our ice cream guy was very friendly & helpful and the ice cream's pretty good too. However, the prices are waaaay too high and we won't be hurrying back.We stopped in here after a workday on a business trip. The decor and the menu are rather like every other neighborhood Italian place. The service was mediocre; nothing exceptional.

Thankfully the food was enjoyable. I had the spaghetti dish with the seafood variety. In summary, I don't think this is a place to go out of your way for, but if I was placed at the same hotel again, I would likely return for another meal.With the mystery user Paul having deleted his "review" ... and with a return visit I'm adding a star to my previous review.

The coffee is still nothing to crow about (try Conspire for the best coffee in town IMHO) but my sandwich was pretty good (but over priced). 

I just SOOOO want to love this place it almost hurts.

Well the interior is stunningly beautiful and it's much improved from what was in the venue before (the dirty hippy coffee shop).I would put this place at 3.5. This place's high points are it's great renovation. The inside of this place is awesome and homey. I could sit there for hours. I also love the use of local art to adorn the walls. This place just has a good feel about it. 

The flip side is probably that they are a little pricey. This is bad considering some of the local shops that have better food and coffee at better prices. So, all in all, this place is a good little stop for some pretty good coffee and comfort.The ROK ROCKS!  I visited this club in March 09 for the first time and I thought it was a decent club.  Fedde Le Grand also rencently played here.  It must have been RAM JAM that night as it is a smaller club.  The bar area can tend to get crowded but there is an outside bar also with smoking area.  Not that I smoke but its good to cater to the needs of others.  Please tell the chubbies on the gogo box in the center of the dance floor that its just not cool to see you drop it like its hot up there.

I would have given this place an extra star but again we got the hard sell for a VIP table at the front of the line.  We were rollin 5 deep all guys but we were already getting in free so why get a table.  I really just wanted to check the place out as it was our first visit and we were also considering hopping to another club after a few.  By midnight the place was poppin off.  I do want to go back again.I hate being one of the first people to write a less-than-stellar review for this place, but I also feel the need to be honest - so here goes. This only applies to the waxing services, though, and not the salon, and took place late last year.

After reading all the amazing things about this place, maybe I expected too much, but my experience didn't leave me very happy - or smooth. 

I got an appointment for my brazilian wax pretty easily, and mentioned I'm a Yelper, which earned me a discount. Lots of points for this, because you supposedly get a discount all the time for being on here. Good news for frequent customers.

D'Lisa was running late on the day I came in, which I didn't mind at all. Things happen. What I DID mind was that she acted very rushed throughout my entire appointment. She seemed nice enough, but I explained that it was my first time and I was very nervous, so I thought maybe she'd try to make me feel comfortable... but I didn't pick that up from her. It's bad enough laying on a table with everything exposed; it's worse to feel like the person waxing you is doing their best to hurry through it so they can get you out the door.

The pain was pretty bad, and I'm sure she could tell, so maybe that's part of the reason she wanted to hurry... but still.

I left feeling very sore and a little confused. When the redness and swelling had gone down, I checked and found many, many hairs left... mostly lighter ones, but I didn't feel smooth at all. Pretty disappointing, considering I paid for something that I can do with more precision myself. I know it's harder to see the lighter hairs, but there were quite a few dark ones left, and I had to do some touching up just to get everything even.

The lack of precision and rushed atmosphere I experienced here will likely keep me away in the future. Not sure why I was the exception, but I really didn't feel welcome here. Maybe sometimes you just don't "click" with a place or the employees.I'm afraid my love affair with Massage Nirvana fizzled out the last couple of months. Their front desk staff is still top notch, the facility is still clean and super comfy and the ease of making an appointment is still intact. 

My disappointment stems from their high massage therapist turnover. Since I've joined, every time I've loved a therapist, they've left after about 3-5 months. It's disconcerting to keep on finding the next "right" therapist and after a few less than stellar massages I decided to cool things off with Massage Nirvana and ended my membership. Also, my wonderful aesthetician Maria has also left and that was a large reason why I kept up the membership. 

I will still recommend Massage Nirvana to one-timers (visitors, family) who are looking to get some treatments outside the strip at a nice facility. If they are able to retain their good masseuses/aestheticians this place would be a diamond in Las Vegas. Pity.Think Dinty Moore canned roast beef...just like my mom used to make it for movie night at Town & Country's AMC. She'd make it with a can of Ortega diced green chilis, diced onions but this version adds cabbage and tomatoes. And all for $4. Love it. Before you go off on it, remember how much you're paying for this burro! Four bucks. You haven't had it this good since you had medium pizzas for "regular price, four bucks, four bucks, four bucks."

I ordered the beans and rice on the side (they're normally served inside the burro), so I got to taste the sticky Spanish rice seasoned with chili powder on its own. The whole beans were pretty good too. Great as a side dish; so _glad_ I ordered them on the side. You can even take one of the bottles of habanero sauce to the table to impress and double dare your friends!

I have to agree with others' comments on the "homemade" lemonade. Like the beef burro It also took me straight back to my childhood, remembering sugary (think corn syrupy) Freezees at Circle-K. Definitely not fresh (except for the wedge of lime which was dry) but oh so memorable.

Don't forget the success of tiny Lenny's burgers at 15th Ave. Hippies pops at lunch being so close to the Brophy and Xavier campus. Great value, and location location location. I hope it's in the running for a permanent spot on the "square" (7th St to Ave, Camelback to McDowell).

Yea! Can't wait to try their special shrooms at the other location.the enormous beer selection is great! unfortunately our server, Matt, didn't have a clue about any of the beers other than the very few he personally liked. thumbs up for yard house, thumbs down for matt.I'm always running late so I just run in and grab and go. They didn't have the snowman doughnuts I was really hoping for ... but nonetheless the ones I did pick out were fresh...but I'm wondering where they're made? 'Cause if its close... I'm there! The store seemed kinda trashy...maybe it was just the people in line in front of me... really folks... how hard is it to pick out a KK??Very relaxing atmosphere and quality service.  We sat outside and enjoyed the passer byers.  The patio seats where comfy and the music set the ambiance of "earlier days".

Although they had very creative dinner options that ranged from Escargot to Crawfish Etouffee I was feeling boring and got a Green Chile Grilled Cheese Sandwich.  It was basic and I realized that when I have a larger appetite I'll have to go back and try a better dish.I live right by ATS. RIGHT THERE. I had been there before and wasn't too impressed, but I had to give it another chance based on proximity alone. So I went after being reminded of the joint on abc15. The piece they were featured in made my mouth water so I decided to walk on over. 

I have to admit I am rather picky when it comes to Mexican food. I think most Mexicans are because nothing is going to compare to what Nana used to make us when we were young. Although I am choosy I do have favorite places that can suffice when I need some spice. (Sorry I had to be corny) 

They have signs that say best carne asada in town and I am sorry, but the Charlie's catering cart has better carne asada and they do not charge $3 per Mexican coke. 3 BUCKS! I am no cheap ass but damn. 

If you want to visit and  support small local business (which I totally do) check out ATS. 

If you want something less pricey and arguably more flavorful AZ has TONS of options.I wanted to try Sens more than once before I reviewed it, and now I have, so I feel just in my timing. 

Aesthetically, I enjoy Sens. It's small but it's out of the way, so that's fine. I have the same chairs, in bar chair form. 

The food, I have to say, is ridiculously amazing. So far I have tried the special spring rolls, citron tofu and .. crap, I cannot remember the other one... wasabi tofu? Well, its so good I ordered seconds.

I had a glass of wine once, which was fine. You can't mess that up. I tried the Saigon Martini last night. It wasn't very good. Evidentally the hot and dirty martini is the way to go, but it made me want to hurl. 

The only reason I do not give Sens a 4 is because of the service. The first time I went the service was just not good. It was significantly better last night, but when I asked for a drink suggestion the waiter could not provide one. 

There is nothing terrible about Sens, but IMO the food is exceptional. I will be back, and I hope that by that time they have fixed their service glitches. 

Oh, I have become quite fond of the bathroom..The Bank Hotel bar is in an excellent location for those beginning their night and intending to head on to the Cowgate.  The drinks are relatively cheap with pints costing no more than £3 and the interior feels classy.  
The first time I was in here was at New Year and my flatmate was headbutted in the queue for the bar, however, this could happen anywhere and I doubt it's reflective of its normal atomosphere.  Since then I've seen several stag and hen parties in the pub and its very popular with locals which is, of course, always a good sign.  
Although it isn't my first choice for beginning a night on the tiles, The Bank Hotel is certainly the first port of call for some.  Further, it has outdoor seating which would make a great place to meet with friends for a drink on a warm summer's day.There comes a time when all pubs start to look like each other, and for this reason the interior of the Antiquary doesn''t differ too much from the norm; it's dungeony, (but at least it's got the excuse of being in the basement floor!) is decked out in dark polished wood and has quite friendly staff. Take into account that the general Edinburgh pub standard is pretty high, and you've got a pretty good quality place.

Location wise, it's a little bit off the beaten track, particularly for tourists, as it's in Stockbridge, so I won't be making it back there anytime soon! However, they do some good food, particularly breakfast if you'd rather eat than drink, and have some open mic nights, with folk music being the general theme.As far as local pubs go, this has got to be mine seeing as I live directly opposite it and I do have a soft spot for it. It is one of the pubs that is busier on Wednesday afternoon than Saturday evening. Actually to be honest it's about the same because it's exactly the same people in there all the time. It could easily be the scene from a sitcom with a load of old boys propping up the bar, each with their own little quirk. Going in there quite a bit over the past year I have got to know them and they are all nice lads but if I were just popping in whilst passing I would feel very out of place. 

The beers are exactly what you'd expect in this sort of place. The have a few lagers and a few ales on tap but nothing special. The only thing notable as far as drinks go is that a bottle of Bulmers only costs £2.70, cheaper than most of the student bars. 

There is a jukebox, but it is rarely turned on. Instead the bar staff opt for their laptops attached to the speakers as then they can put on old the old classics that the regulars seem to love. There is also a pool table, and if you get chatting to a few of the old boys a game or 2 invariably follows. As well as this they have a free dart board, which is good at first, but becomes increasingly frustrating the more drinks you have (and with my flatmate's accuracy drastically shortening the life expectancy of anyone in the near vicinity).

It is a nice little pub but nothing special and unless you are a regular or know them it can feel a little intimidating, but they are friendly old bods so give it a chance.Being one of the first public house establishments you encounter as you come up Waverley Station from this side, one would expect it to be full of travellers and tourists enjoying their first or last pint in the city.

This ain't the case for this place. Although it seems inviting from the outsider it certainly is a local pub with it's regulars which means if they don't like the look of you then don't expect great service. Or a smile.

Now before you get up in arms about this, I don't always find this such a bad  thing- adds a bit of local attitude. Sure it's full of grumpy old men but buy them a pint and get them chatting and you made yourself a friend. Not everywhere has turned to Starbucks fake smile service yet and not everyone wants to either. 

So yes it's slightly hostile but perhaps being a bit more thick-skinned about the whole thing ain't a bad life lesson. If they see you don't give a damn that they don't give a damn then everyone is happy. (in their own misserable way).I thought Philpotts was a sophisticated deli/cafe looking at it from the outside, but I was sorely disappointed when I ventured inside and realised it is a sandwich shop, and a pretty poor one at that. Situated in the busy and bustling Lothian Road in Edinburgh, Philpotts is just a short walk from the city centre and so it ought to be one of the hot spots for buying meals and snacks, but unfortunately it is not. 

They have a deli counter which houses the usual suspects for sandwich fillings - salad, meats and cheeses etc. However, there is nothing that special about their menu or their sandwiches which would make you want to go back. I ordered a BLT sandwich, which was tasty, although the bread was nothing special, and to be honest, I felt as though I could have made the same thing myself at home for a cheaper price. 

The staff were friendly, although I am with the other Yelpers in wondering why they are all dressed in a shirt and tie. Hot drinks, roasts and salads are also available here and there is a seating area inside. Philpotts is a fairly average sandwich shop, but there is nothing about it which would make me want to go back.Popped into Grand Cru last night for a couple of drinks. My margarita was meh - salty rim but a lack of kick from the tequila and lime. The gin and lemonade I had afterwards was decent though.

Quite a lot of (comfy) seats in this Hanover St bar. Drinks promo's appear to run Mon-Thurs so spirit and mix is £2 and some cocktails, marked CC for cocktail club are also 1/2 price so around the £3 mark so cheap if you are looking for a couple of drinks in that week before pay day.

Does food as well - typical bar stuff and not great for gluten free at first glance so maybe wouldn't return for food. For a cheap drink it is ok but the clientele are very 'young' looking - lots of blonde hair, tans and A&F clothing...Free upgrade on size if you say Sandeman tours! At least that's what I was told...I forgot. Caramel Hot Coco mmmmm...I haven't seen that in America or Ireland, but maybe I just need to look closer. I also got carrot cake that was a disappointment over a carrot cake I had from them before, but it was free because of a coupon the Sandeman tour people had so I can't complain too much! 

Not a lot of room, and really crowded due to being right on the Royal Mile.What is it  with "coffee shops" that LOOK like coffee shops but turn out to be fast food restaurants?

From the outside Newington Coffee Shop (theoretically a coffee shop in Newington) looks like a fairly ordinary coffee shop, the kind of place you sip your morning cappuccino with your pastry while you read the paper. But inside it looks more like McDonalds, with big lit up boards displaying what burgers and pizzas are on offer. Maybe this is just the next step in evolution for the greasy spoon.

Anyway I suppose Newington Coffee Shop is fine at what it does, once we've established just what that is. It's quite a big place, with lots of seats (though it can get quite busy). The hot drinks are pretty standard and well priced. The food is pretty cheap takeaway average but the portions are decent.

I wouldn't recommend Newington Coffee Shop is you are expecting a quaint little Italian, to appreciate a fine espresso and maybe treat yourself to an almond croissant. But if you want to stuff your face with cheap pizza in an honest environment, then Newington Coffee Shop ain't that bad!So, I've been to Spoon a couple of times now and have arrived at a definite 3 stars.

The setting is lovely. Lots and lots of tables and mismatched chairs giving a nice eclectic homey feel. Very friendly staff too. 

The most recent time there was a pretty long wait (an hour) until our food arrived and little attention whilst waiting which was a shame.  However we were a large group and there was another large group in so perhaps were a bit busy. 

Food rather mediocre but good enough. Won't be in a hurry to return but wouldn't be totally disappointed to go again - if you know what I mean?A trusty city-centre meeting place if you want to catch up with folk with a drink and a bit of grub. The themed bar is quite fun, with dark wood, booths and monster-themed bits and pieces throughout. Loos are hidden behind a book case; can't go wrong with hidden bathrooms! It's also considerably bigger inside than its front would suggest, with a downstairs section that works perfectly for the monthly film quiz (no mobile reception for quiz cheats, joy!).

I'm not a massive fan of the place, probably because I'm not very into themed bars, but it does its job well enough. Prices are about what you'd expect for a city centre bar and the food menu is basic pub grub - cheap enough and reasonably cheerful. 

I do like that the Jekyll and Hyde isn't pretentious - you can come here and feel quite at home.Lovely hotel set in the heart of Edinburgh.  Princes Street is so close to everything and anything you wish to do is just on your door step.  The staff are very friendly and accommodating and the rooms are clean and comfortable.  As Princes Street is one of the main thorough fairs of Edinburgh if you are a light sleeper - ear plugs would be a necessity!Had a dinner here and it look like something recooked. Very average...I think this place can be hit or miss. It is in a fantastic location, right at the end of Princes Street, and walking distance to Haymarket station. Great if your going to catch a train or starting a night out. It is nice and welcoming inside and great for people watching if you get a window seat.

When you walk past in the morning there is wide selection of people having breakfast and reading their paper. So I guess the breakfast much be good, although I can't comment.

A friend and I went for lunch and really enjoyed it. We shared Cajun Chicken Nachos which were a good portion and very yummy. Definitely hit the right spot. The service was good too, and it wasn't too crowded.

Another occasion my boyfriend and I went for dinner and we were a little disappointed. It was far too crowded so it was hard to hear each other. However it was near to Christmas time, so I guess everywhere is a little busier. The service was a little slow too. I had the fish and chips which I didn't think were the best I had ever had, but not the worst either. 

I probably reserve judgment on whether I really like Ryan's Bar or not until the next time I visit. There is a great selection of food on the menu so it is definitely worth trying again I think.I'm not sure how I got to the age of 25 without having had a Tapas experience but Dionika was certainly a good place to start and it's definately put me on a mission to expand my Tapas repertoire!

I went there with 7 other friends on a Saturday evening and it was nicely decorated with plenty of welcoming staff but you could have heard the tumbleweed roll by when we went in.

I'm told this place has been around for a long time but given that we were the only diners there when we arrived and the prices were very reasonable I have no idea how they are making their money. We were there for a good couple of hours and only one other table was occupied during that time. This is quite nice if you are a large group of tapas novices who require a wee bit of extra attention from the staff and want to have a good blether with each other but it must be a bit awkward if you go with a partner and feel that your every word can be heard.

It's a shame that Dionika is lacking in patrons to bring in a bit of atmosphere because the food is delicious, varied, fun and really good value for money. Any place that can make anchovies taste good deserve some recognition in my book. The staff indulged our group when we ordered a single portion of fried milk out of curiosity (still undecided on this wierd custardy creation). 

I'd like to add that I was impressed by the nice, fluffy towel in the ladies loo. This might sound unhygienic but given the limited number of users it was actually a nice touch!Loved the decor of the place and the food was pretty good. The hake fillet was beautifully cooked as were the ox cheeks. The mushroom risotto however was a bit lacking in seasoning and flavor.

The restaurant consists of a large beautiful sunny dining room and then a small back room with poor lighting where all the foreigners are seated. When we got to the restaurant there were plenty of tables available in the bright sunny area, and we also had reservations. The host seated us in the back room with 4 other tables operated by Americans. Later he seated a Russian couple in the room who actually complained that they wanted to sit in the other room. The host insisted that the room was only available for people who made reservations, but in the next 30 minutes or so the room had cleared out and there were plenty of tables available.  Although the food was good, I would not recommend this place to any fellow Americans as the seating segregation left a poor taste in my mouth.I had heard a lot about the Earl from my friends living in Marchmont, so I was really excited when they suggested we go there for our pre-drink rather than our usual haunt.
Firstly, I was surprised at how small the Earl was. There were around 25 seats, every one taken, and people standing everywhere. I bumped into a friend (literally bumped into him) but couldn't stop to chat because there seemed to be a one-way flow of human traffic around me. Don't get me wrong, it was a really nice wee bar with a lot of character to it, but I think it's reached a stage where it's reputation precedes its reality. I wouldn't choose to go there if I wanted a nice drink with my friends, but I would choose to go there if I wanted to re-live my first year at uni and socialize with Marchmont's elite.If there is one thing which certainly gets the thumbs up from me it is generous portion sizes.  Thankfully Potatoland fufils this essential criterion as they only sell big, man-sized, crispy-skinned, fluffy-centred potatoes.  Both times which I went in my first year I got my potato filled with a generous helping chilli con carne which was delicious and easily sufficed for a lunchtime meal on its own.  
There is, however, room for improvement in Potatoland.  Being nestled away deep in the tail end of Clerc Street it is up against serious competition and, in my opinion, it would benefit from several key adjustments.  
Inside the place it feels dark, dour and almost cramped.  Further, the selection of fillings just isn't adequate when compared with some of the sandwich shops nearby which are also baying for customers.  Chilli, beans, cheese or tuna mayonnaise were some of the only options available and one can't help but question their lack of imagination.  Nonetheless, Potatoland is a great little business which should be worthy of competing with the best in the area.Been gagging on a Chicken Pad Thai for 6 months (can't believe it's been that long already!) so a few weeks ago I began the hunt, scouring the city for Thai restaurants with my aforementioned favourite on their menu... 

Celadon? Prawn only. 
Time 4 Thai? Prawn only. 
Thai Orchid? PRAWN ONLY! 

Now I know I could probably venture in and request the chicken variety, of course I'm sure they would be more than happy to accommodate me. But who wants to be the fussy diner in the Thai Restaurant? Hmm? Anyone? 

Thus my journey continued. And led me to the Wild Elephant, possibly the closest Thai Restaurant to my home funnily enough. 

Could it be the nutty noodle dish I have craved so long had been right here under my nose all along?? And with lifted spirits, my answer came... 

It could! 

Now I can only comment on the takeaway service as I did not plan on passing this place, remembering my quest and reacting as impulsively as I did. If I'm honest I don't think I could ever enter a restaurant with the pre-notion of requesting a "table for one, please...."! 

In the 5 minutes/eternal wait I had to endure, I passed the time buying a lottery ticket and browsing the menu for other delights that may pique my interest and/or memory. I can agree with others on the state of the prices. Considering the most I've ever spent on Pad Thai is about £3.50, the menu was a bit of a fright, valuing my meal at £9.99! 

A slight relief is that the price comes down for takeaway and I only had to part with £6.50 (the friendly lady was kind enough to waive 49p due to their lack of change and my only alternative payment the crisp £20 note in my pocket!). 

The Pad Thai, however, was delightful. The portion perfect, and I'm sure I'll part with 7 quid again one day when I get my next craving. But with classier, cheaper options in town, The Wild Elephant will most likely be cast as the bit of rough I go to for my Chicken Pad Thai fix! 

HIGHLIGHT: The reunion of the year! 

LOWLIGHT: Didn't win Euromillions...!This is very much a traditional charity shop, much as you would expect with it being the oldest charity shop in Edinburgh as its shop front boldly proclaims.  By this I mean that you have the majority of the shop dedicated to clothes, a small book section and some old tapes, Cd's and DVDs.  It's main asset is its staff who are all very friendly.

It's fairly typical, everything is reasonably cheap, but what I feel lets it down is the fact that it doesn't specialise.  In this area you have specific charity shops and I can tell you where to get most of the items this shop sells cheaper if you are willing to visit a load of shops.  All round this is pretty good for value, but in no area does it excel which means that if you want something specific you can get it cheaper elsewhere.The Luckenbooth, on the Royal Mile, is a refreshing change from the normal Edinburgh tourist shop fare.  So many of these places are full of useless tat that would only lure in a gullible tourist.  The Luckenbooth is breaking the mould by offering something a bit different.

Jewellery is what this place majors on.  According to Wikipedia, this is one of many shops that have would have existed on the Royal Mile since the 16th century, selling Scottish jewellery.  Some of the items they offered did look pretty nice, but as Jonny says, the range of designs is quite limited.  Good if you like that sort of stuff though.

Together with the jewellery, there is a small range of other Scottish gifts available to purchase.  Fortunately, this does not dominate.  And anyway, there are tourist shops all over the place, so there's always a place just round the corner to satisfy your need for a kilt towel.Liberation is a very gimmicky shop specialising in affordable, generic logo tees and poster art.

When you walk in you're hit with just about every popular cultural icon under the sun, from the imitation Andy Warhol depiction of Marilyn Monroe to Darth Vader. There are enough Superman hoodies in here to clothe the East of Scotland and Star Wars jumpers for people who want it to be known that they've seen the movie.

I don't like to be judgemental but it's the kind of place for kids who want to display things they love on their torso so everyone knows they are informed about popular culture. That's enough of my pop psychology, but you know there are going to be predictable Tarantino t shirts in here before you've even entered the shop.

They have a small selection of kilts and Batman belt buckles, some band tees and a small selection of jewellery, but Liberation are all about latching on to widely accepted humour. That's why there's a huge amount of Spiderpig merchandise, some old throwbacks to The Dark Knight and some slogan t shirts aimed at irate teenagers. My aunt would call it moronic, I would call it a bit tacky, but some teenagers and students will be all about it.This place has EVERYTHING. If you're moving into a new home and have no furniture at all, I would suggest this place. They carry sofas, vases, pictures, sectionals, love seats, recliners, dining tables, beds, coffee pots, scales, lamp shades, curtains, blankets,....EVERYTHING.

We saw some decent pieces, but still wanted to shop around. Because the merchandise is coming from hotels there is more than 1 of just about everything. We didn't feel rushed to buy anything. 

The reason I gave it 3 stars is because the majority of furniture is bulky, over sized and a little dated. Just because it didn't work for us doesn't mean it may not work for someone else. The prices are unbeatable and I would suggest looking here in addition to other places.No way around it: this place is overpriced. From the menu prices to the plate-splitting charges to the extra ingredients to the sides. Food itself it good not great.

Blue Burger confirmed to me that they use specials and happy hours when they first open to generate traffic, but take them away once they hit the critical mass they want. So don't get to hooked on anything you like about these places.This is a good place to go with the family. The food is good and fresh. The staff is nice and helpful. As long as you eat in the restaurant, it's good. I don't recommend taking it home. It can get cold and isn't nearly as good. This is one of my wife favorite places. This isn't the best BBQ place in town, but it's pretty good considering it's a chain.It's ok.  I love their soup.  The egg foo yung patties are terrible.  But they do have great sauce and fresh veggies.  The staff is nice.  I am just not blown away by the food.We at at the Grand Lux Cafe for dinner on Saturday 12/28.

The restaurant was fairly busy but we were sat right away.

We ordered two mojitos - as a person who loves to drink and make mojitos at home these mojitos were just ok. They definitely were not worth the price which was 12 bucks a piece. I think they were way to heavy on the simple syrup heavy and not enough lime or club soda. And please tell me why this drink costs 12 bucks - it should be half that. 

The did serve complementary warm bread which was very good.

For the entrees I had the Southwestern Salad and it was just fantastic. I liked  everything about it. It was chopped style so everything was cubed or rectangular shaped :). The salad dressing was fantastic. There was one item that I am not sure was supposed to be in the salad. I feel like either jacima or apple slices were put in it and that was not on the ingredients but it was delicious and I shared with my hubby and we ate every last bite of it. 

For our entries the hubby had the Wood Grilled B.B.Q. Burger with french fries. The burger was really big, and he liked it but he wasn't raving about it. I think he wished he ordered something different because when I asked him if he liked his dinner he said it was good but mine was REALLY good.

The service was good.Da grinds were ONO, da service not so ono!  If you work at L&L you better know what's on your menu better than da Hawaiian who's ordering it!I came here because it was the most convenient place to go to and it was right next to the sportsbook. This isn't really a place you should go to if it's out of the way. The items don't come with sides, so you have to order it.

I ordered the triple decker sandwich which contained pastrami and brisket. The pastrami was decent, but the brisket killed the sandwich for me. 

The spicy fries weren't really that spicy. It just had a little cayenne pepper. Not really worth it.  You should order the garlic parmesan fries instead.Not sure at this age I can give any club 5 stars, but XS was def the most extreme of the 3 I visited this weekend: longest lines, most expensive cover (for the guys $30), largest space, most crowded, most dance poles, most chill staff, most places to sit, least stuffy, shortest dresses, highest heels, most panties flashed!I got to say I've been to clubs in hollywood and they seriously don't compare. I mean this club is seriously so enormous and absolutly off the hook, not to mention it has tons of stripper poles woo hoo!!! With enough booze you'll be a pro. Half the club is inside while the other half is outside. 

Okay so be here early because the lines are long and i mean huge!!! I was tempted to leave when I saw the line, and i got there half an hour before they opened, but it moved pretty fast though. It's 20 dollars for ladies and nope there is no guestlist so unless you know someone then you're paying.  

There are tons of restrooms so hooray you usually don't have to wait long. The drinks are pretty pricey 12 for cocktails and one cost my friend 15 bucks so be prepared to pay tons of money for drinks or just go buzzed. 

So why the 3 stars?! Well it should be a 5, but this club is just so huge that it's pretty impossible to meet and chat with people, or if you see a hottie and look away for one second, boom he's gone and chances are you probably won't be able to find him again. Also, as much as i like the pool area, it was hot so if you danced near that area you were pretty much suffocating, this place needs some major AC. 

But will I return?! Hell yeah!Fifty bucks.

Rush through your dinner buffet, because your friends swear that this club is it.

Wait in line at 8 pm.

Get in early.

Sit around and listen to trance with all the other people from your hometown. The same darn people you went to Las Vegas to avoid.

Wait until midnight, it will get interesting.

This club does remind me a lot of Tryst, but the outdoor part is what sets it apart. So many private room things and you can also dip in the pool.

You might see a celebrity or two.

There are enough drugs in here to make my D.A.R.E. officer cry.

But it costs Fifty Bucks.WAS my favorite club in LV but now I think its overrated.

LONG line (at least an hr)
COVER: girls $20 (WTF) guys $30
Big dance floor
WEAK music
Too crowded
Drunk people dancing in the pool
Not strict on dress code (homeboy rolled up in a hoodie, not cute)

Yeah I'll come back because I know the majority of the people I go with always want to come here. Over the hype, I'm ready to try new clubs in LV.Whew, prices are steep, but a to-go cup of their deliciously spicy virgin mary will just hit the spot sometimes.After a long day of showing the city to my sweetheart we came back to the hotel starving. We went into Snaps for a quick snack before bed and they didn't disappoint. OMG a short stack for $1.99 you can't beat late night munchie food like pancakes and at this price so cool. My girl got Parmesan Onion Rings they were huge and very good.

Can't beat the comfort food and the prices!This place isn't what it is all hyped up to be. I've been here 2 times total. The first time was when my boyfriend took me and had set up their special romance package ahead of time. That includes a dozen roses, Champagne and two flute glasses, four-course Big Night Out® meal, picture in a pewter frame, private booth for two with curtains for $150.  Though I do not believe there were any roses and we did not get a picture in a pewter frame either. We did enjoy their cheese fondue (we chose the spinach and artichoke). Their wedge salad wasn't anything special. 
Our least favorite parts of the 4-course meal was the entrée. They give you 4-5 different meats that you cook for yourself in the pot if boiling water in the middle of your table. Each item cooks at different lengths, which my boyfriend disliked because the instructions were long and confusing. After we'd cooked all the meat and eaten we were very disappointed. There was hardly any flavor to it unless you dipped it in one of the 8 sauces they give you. 
The dessert was our favorite part of the meal, though we wouldn't go as far as to say it was phenomenal by any means. 
All in all this experience was not worth the price tag.
My most recent visit was for their "Girls Night Out" on Mondays. Food-wise the experience was the same but the price was better! And the best of all was their signature drinks. I would go back for their martini's, though they aren't strong they are delicious!(+)
- nasi goreng
- thai tea

(-)
- pricey

Decided to try this place on Sunday afternoon. It wasnt very busy and we got to sit at the big table under the head of the humongous dragon attached to the wall, totally rad! 

I got the nasi goreng (fried rice) which was 23 bucks and thai tea which was 5 bucks. Both were good though I don't think the nasi goreng was worth what I paid. Pretty good service, they box your leftovers for you in reusable plastic boxes too, legiiit.

Service was attentive. 

Good food but high prices.yeah Toast is really brilliant - read the reviews below this to see that it really is a diamond in the rough in Marchmont. But lets not ignore the price!! It's ridiculously overpriced and costs a arm and a leg for the cheapest things!
When I came here I ordered a hot chocolate - costing me £4.20 to do so, and my friends sandwich cost a whopping £5.60! The sandwich wasn't anything special, we could have popped next door to Scotmid and made it ourselves.
I think I'll have to give Toast a second chance, its first impression wasn't a great one.Tonight was my first time ever eating at this restaurant. I started off with the sampler of there house brews.  I then ordered the jambalaya for my entree.  The beer was half way decent, and I enjoyed the knowledgeable presentation by our waiter who was very outstanding by the way.  The jambalaya was decent I was disappointed in the lack of seasoning, overcooked rice, and lack of meat.  Overall it was an ok experience, but our waiter is the reason I most definitely will return to this place to try the other menu options.If there's one city in the UK that really doesn't suit having this crass, tasteless testament to conspicuous consumption, then it's Edinburgh. I've already voiced my concern in previous reviews that Edinburgh's genteel charm seems to be slowly getting swallowed up by the hideous WAG culture that dominates shops and nightclubs in Liverpool, Glasgow and Manchester. Harvey Nick's is the embodiment of this.

Champagne (Cava) nail bars, 12 inch high shoes with "Dior" emblazoned on them, and aisles filled with screeching, orange girls reeking of perfume. It's a million miles away from the traditional opulence of Jenner's, and as a general rule, if you're buying something from this store, the main reason behind the purchase is to show people you (or more likely your present lover) can afford it.

Severely lacking in customers for it's first few years but bizarrely seeming to be a bit busier since Britain went bankrupt, it gets an extra star for the food hall. I rarely buy anything, but it's great for finding unusual foreign ingredients and meal ideas that I can go and look for somewhere else.First and foremost ,you have to understand that you're eating Chinese food at a casino. If you can grasp that then your dining experience expectations will be dramatically different(meaning you have to  lower your standards; it's equivalent to a weekend of heavy drinking if you were single and you're looking to settle for the night minus the walk of shame in the morning). We dined here solely because my friend (the groom) really wanted his fix of noodles and wonton. 

For those that are accustomed to a lower price point for similar food back home, they will most likely get a nice wake up call since the price point for the menu here is significantly higher (again you have to grasp the realization that you're dining at a casino). We ordered  the wonton, egg noodle soup; beef stew noodles; and the xiao long baos (soup dumplings). The wontons were suprisingly flavorful, the xiao long baos were decent although the texture of the dumpling skin was on the soggy side, and the beef stew would probably be the best dish we had. But for obvious reasons it's not food that I would wait on line for or anything.

As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the food wasn't the best, but when you're fiending for some Chinese food and you're in the middle of the desert, expect to pay a higher price point to somewhat get that fix. However, a full satisfaction of what you're yearning for may not be fully met. Nonetheless, it may just help hold you over till you head back to you respective go to Chinese place back home. It could be worse, what if there was only a P.F. Chang's or only  mall type of a take out that was around? Bottomline, the place is serviceable to somewhat meet your fiending needs of rice or noodles.Pros - 

-  Cheapest resort in Vegas
-  Great location bang on the Strip.  
-  Clean room and big bath tub (on Island Tower rooms)
-  Cheap casino to warm up for larger places / gamble only a little
-  Closest to airport

Cons - 

-  Terrible restaurants (Starbucks was the only good place!)
-  Boring and dull free entertainment (do not waste your time on Hypnosis Unleashed - its not only a fraud, but a boring fraud)
-  Elevator didn't work for one out of the three days I was there.
-  Savmor car rental near front desk - are f*******.
-  Not exciting whatsoever.I had never sampled Thai cuisine, though I had always been interested in doing so, and when I discovered a Thai restaurant near my house, last week, I thought it'd be a great place to have dinner with the fam.

First of all, the place is TINY!  I think there might be half a dozen booths along one wall and another half dozen tables.  When we arrived (party of five), all of the booths were taken and the front tables were occupied, so they set us up in the back.  Well, one member of our party was in a wheelchair - oh, boy!  This place is NOT wheelchair-friendly.  We actually had to ask the patrons to excuse us so we could pass, luckily, they were leaving anyway, but still, it's embarassing to have to interrupt someone's meal so you can be seated.

I ordered the Pad-Thai and other members in my party ordered the Stir-fried Eggplant, pork Pha Nang, pork Green Curry, and Thai BBQ sausages.

The portions were not at all large, but there was enough that we could each sample a little of everything.

The Pad-Thai wasn't bad; everyone in my party liked it.  I thought it had a weird texture and was awfully sweet, but when mixed with a little chili paste, it wasn't bad.

The Stir-fried Eggplant was really good.  It was supposed to contain jalepenos, but it wasn't at all spicy.

The Green Curry was actually the spicier of the two curry dishes that were ordered.  It wasn't bad, a little runny, but the yellow and green string beans were good.

The pork Pha Nang was by far the best dish.  It wasn't as spicy as I would have liked it (they season to order, but we were told they are prepared to medium, unless otherwise stated), but had a great consistency and was so delicious mixed with rice.  

The Thai BBQ sausages.

*sigh*

We basically paid $9.00 for a couple of roasted hot dogs.  For that price, I could've gone to Costco/Sam's Club and purchased hot dogs WITH sodas that include REFILLS and still have money leftover for a pretzel or a couple of churros.

Now, of course, Thai dogs, er, sausages, have a different flavor and texture than Hebrew National or Nathan's.  They're similiar to longanesa, but with a higher fat content.  I noticed that the meat was mixed with rice before it was stuffed into the casing - sneaky, sneaky.  There was no sauce, or anything with it, and it was served on a bed of iceburg lettuce with steamed rice - very dry!  

I wasn't too thrilled with our waitress (who I later found out was one of the "partners").  She brought the wrong order to my father and then argued with him saying that he ordered it, but changed his mind.  My mother was attempting to help my father and tried to explain that after the waitress took our orders, my mother asked my father what he ordered and he said "the sausage," but she wouldn't let my mother finish what she was saying.  The waitress cut her off mid-sentence and began talking to someone else.  *jaw dropped*  I think we would have jumped up and left had it not been for the fact that we'd have to mow down some people with that darned wheelchair.  However, even after acknowledging that she brought out an order that my father didn't want, she tried to talk him into keeping it by saying that he wouldn't like the sausage because it was "sour."  Now, the sausages sucked, I'll give her that, but they weren't sour, they were actually kinda sweet.

As to the owner, he was there the night we dined in.  He's actually a pretty nice guy.  Yeah, he comes up to your table and chats with you (I think he came up to us, like, 4-5 times, maybe because we indulged him), but he's harmless.  From what I discerned from his brief, but frequent stops to our table, he's not from this area and he just seems rather lonely.  He was polite enough to wait and approach our table when we weren't stuffing our faces or when there was a lull in the conversation, so as not to blatantly interrupt.  From what I gathered, he's one of a handful of investors in this restaurant and pretty excited about it.  I'm sure that after the business is more established (it's only been operating for a few months), he'll probably back off a little, especially if he makes more friends in this area.

From talking to him, though, we discovered that all of the cooks are actually from Thailand, which is novel and probably helps add an authentic flair to the dishes.

I wasn't completely thrilled with the experience, but the food was okay, not great - good-ish (factoring in amount and quality for the price). 

I will go there, again, but only because I want to try their lunch specials.  Unfortunately, the Pha Nang isn't one of them, but they do have some other dishes I want to try out and the lunch specials, aside from having a reduced price, come with soup and egg rolls.  However, considering my experience with the waitress and wheelchair fiasco, I'll probably make my lunch order to go!Served with rice or mashed potatoes and macaroni or tossed salad include beef or chicken teriyaki, chop steak and onions, kalbi short ribs yummy, hawaiian style pork roast with hawaiian salt and cracked black pepper. Yummy Boil or sauteed opakapaka 9snapper0 Kalua pig and cabbage, 12oz  ribeye and loco moco, a half pound hamburger patty on rice but i like ground beef but only patty on rice topped with eggs and gravy.Walked in and noticed a sign with alcohol specials. Said bloody Marys were 3.50 but when I ordered one was told that was only for weekends. So ordered one anyway, tasted like it was straight tomato juice with lemon squeezed into it. Had the medium hot wings, good flavor but they made u pay an extra 50 cents for blue cheese. Whoever heard of hot wings with no blue cheese? So next time ill stick to the ice water and bring along my own blue cheese,Had lunch there yesterday at 2:30.  People were friendly but the wait staff took too long to check in with sodas and keeping the table clean. It wasn't busy. Ate 90% salad bar and it was ok.  The veggies in the specialty areas were "tired" looking and tried a couple but were over done (brussel sprouts and green beans).  Maybe they're better earlier.Food is pretty good! I love the selection, and during the weekdays it's not too busy/crowded. 

Location is nice, service was good, prices are fair ($12 each). Lots of options to choose from for protein and toppings, plus the sauces are awesome!

YC's is a nice dinner date night spot (nothing to impress a first date with, something to take the husband/wife to), but can get expensive with a large family.Love the products, just feel "eh" about this store.  As a local, it's not in an optimal location but that's fine.  

As stated by previous reviewers, the staff can be a bit aggresive and pushy.  On two occassions, I've let them do a demonstration and offer me a sample only to get to the register and be told that they don't do samples.    However, there are some very nice people that work there as well, and my shopping experience is so much better when it's the less aggresive group on duty.

It's also always outrageously LOUD in there.  Between the music, product being pushed in your face, and the fragrance, it can be pretty overwhelming.

I wish they'd put one at Town Square or Tivoli, or even at the District.  I think it would be more calm and certainly would be much easier for locals to access.My personal favorite Thai place is Thai Style Noodle House on Spring Mountain or Fort Apache but I thought since this place was so close to my work Id come here for lunchtime. 

I definitely recommend this place for their lunch specials and this is my go-to place for your hour breaks or to-go. It's usually the same ladies that are working and there are usually only 2 working at a time and during lunch time it's really packed (almost every table is filled). I give the women a thumbs up for their service and the quick turnaround of getting our food after we order. After coming here so many times, the waiters remember the plates we want to order which is a plus for me and shows they care about their customers! I'm not sure which waiters the other reviews are speaking of but I've never had an issue with the service. 

Their food is good but not the best Thai food I've ever tasted. I usually order their Pad Thai (Chicken), Yellow Curry, or Spicy Basil Leaf (Beef). However they are nice and I would continue to come here for lunch breaks. 

If you like spicy, make sure you ask what chilies they have in stock. Some are more spicy than others and their 10 won't be the same every time you order, so be careful!Convenient? Yes. Home to the vast majority of anything cotton you could ever need? Yes. Over priced? Yes. Worth it? On the right occasion. 

I pass by American Apparel on a daily basis and forget it's there. But, then comes the time when I need a bright pink, green or yellow top and think...where should I go? Those are the times when American Apparel comes to the rescue...but I pay the price. It's kind of like traveling to a rainy country without an umbrella and then it rains and you buy an umbrella at double the price. 

American Apparel has pretty much any type of colorful cotton clothing you can imagine. From tights, to tanks, to dresses, to shorts, to leotards...you name it's the Apparel's got it. It's a one stop shop for anything from costume needs to your daily colorful cotton needs. If my budget wouldn't slap me on the hand, I'd shop there more. But, when I need something and can't find it anywhere else, American Apparel normally has it. 

If it was less expensive, I'd give it four stars, but since it's only for the budget privileged, I give it a three.A very standard diner with all the things one would expect to see.  An old fashioned cash register, typical older style tables / chairs, and a greasy feel in the air.  The pancakes are bigger than your head - fair warning!  You'll want to share those mammoths with someone if you order them. My fiancee had the corned beef hash which he enjoyed.

I think the down side to this location would have to be the service. They seem to be very efficient with getting food on and off the table, but other than that it's not overwhelmingly personable here. It's a busy location so I can forgive the idea of wanting to flip the table quickly to handle the rush(es) for the most part, but ringing up someone's bill without talking to them is a but much.  

Overall: B
Definitely an "A-OK" place to eat if you are in a diner breakfast mood.Getting to Vdara or just the City Center makes you go in circles, literally. So after getting onto the correct ramp and taking the correct "exit here" sign, we pulled up to the VALET ONLY parking, which is FREE but we just tipped.

Walking into the lobby, the concierge is up front, there's a bar, sitting area and the tram that you can take back to Monte Carlo I believe. FYI, I didn't know that Vdara was a non-gaming hotel. Before you can even get to the elevators, you must show your room key or the old probably ex strip club bouncers won't let you thru. Maybe because the hotel is so damn tall, but the elevators were shaky all the way up. They were pretty fast, but I've been to the Empire State Building ... I don't remember that elevator shaking left to right. 

Once you walk out of the elevators, the floors look like a high end condo or apartments. My cousin's suite was a corner suite which was nice since it only shared one wall. The suite was nice, windows galore with views of the Cosmopolitan, PH and the rest of the strip. No matter where you are, sunsets are pretty and there was a good 180degree view from the room. The blinds were those automatic control blinds with the remote control. There was a half bath off the entrance, table for 4, kitchen with fridge, oven, stove top & microwave. You had your living room, flat screen, desk in the corner with views of the strip. The bedroom was a king bed and I don't know where they got there sheets, but they had to have been 1000 thread count! LOL. Softest hotel sheets ever! The bathroom was pretty big, glassed in shower, two sinks, soaking tub also with strip views.

All in all, its a nice hotel. Would I stay here?! Maybe. It sucks that its a non-gaming hotel, because what happens when you get bored?! You can't just go down and play on some machines. You'd have to gown down and walk next door to Aria. Also, some of the finishes in the room looked like "luxury" but you could tell they weren't. But it the location is good because you're pretty much in the center of the strip and getting to other hotels is easy. And there's a tram that you can take.Pretty solid Chinese food, the portions are large and the lunch specials ($5.99) before 3pm is pretty nice. I seem to order the Orange Chicken or the salt and pepper pork chop the most often.. The egg drop soup is a must as well.I want to start out by saying I'm going to give this place a second try for sure.  But if my yelps aren't honest they don't mean anything.   So here we go.

The space and view is excellent.  Great vibe and view.  The problems started with my order.   I ordered the quiche of the day and sat down.   15 min pass and they came to my table and said they were out of what I ordered.   I switched to what's left, no problem.  Another 15 min passed and I went to the front and they told me it was a very busy day and that it was almost ready.  (It was less busy than an average lunch rush at most places I have been in town.) When I finally got the quiche it was cold and blah.   I hope to try again and experience what everyone is talking about.  It stands on 3 stars for being a cool hang out.I celebrated my 29th birthday here with my cousins.  I love them with all my heart.  I don't think I could be who I am today if I didn't have my cousins to grow up with.  For my 29th, they took me to Cheesecake Factory at Boca Park.  Also, I was here to celebrate my 30th birthday with my parents, and I hung out with one of my friend's here.  No, I'm not a Cheesecake Factory Lover, for some reason I would end up here from time to time.

You don't need a reservation, however at times you'll find your self waiting if you don't have a reservation.  Most of the time it's on a Friday and Saturday that's it's busy.  But what restaurant isn't busy on those two days?  What I like about this spot is the fact it's a huge facility.  When I entered through the huge double doors that seem to reach the ceiling, I found how clean it was.  There was not a trash on site.  The restaurant was super clean and well kept.  I was very impressed by that.

Upon seating, I notice that servers aren't really great.  They always seem to be in a hurry and don't take the time.  I always felt like I was being hurried.  If I took my time, they take forever to get back to me before I can order.  This always happened here.

Let's start with appetizers.  I liked their Fire Roasted Artichokes.  I thought that was a good choice.  It took a long time to get through it but you don't feel so full after eating it.  Their Fried Calamari was just mediocre.  It had too much flour on it and it wasn't as plumpy or juicy as Philippino's make it.  My dad makes them better.  Another you can't go wrong with is the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip.  It's a good starter and isn't too salty.  As for the negatives, don't order their Lettuce Wraps.  It's just not good enough, even to compare to P.F. Chang's.   

The only entree I can remember that I liked was the Meat Loaf.  It tasted very good and was very filling.  The serving portions are so great that you can even take it home with you and eat the rest for lunch the next day.  I only go here if I don't feel like thinking about what to eat and where to go.  Maybe that's why I always end up here.This is a decent buffet, but not worthy of the hype and definitely not worth waiting in line for. It's a good value for sure, but when there's so much in Vegas to do why would I want to stand in a line for an hour and a half like I'm in Disneyland? To be fair, it wasn't an unbearable wait since I helped myself to the complimentary soft drinks on the casino floor and brought some back for my family also.

Now onto the food, the most noticable feature of this buffet is the free beer and wine, which is nothing short of awesome. Now granted, the beer was cheap PBR and coors light but I'm not complaining. The food, however, I found to be quite lacking. The first prime rib slice I got was way too rare and hardly looked like it was cooked at all. The second slice I got was good and made up for it, however. The salads looked unremarkable and the pizza looked worse than the stuff you get in a school cafeteria, so needless to say I tried neither. The selection of food was pretty good, with varying degrees of success. The desserts were very good, though not great. 

Overall, this is a great looking, high value buffet but for those of you who value your time more than your money, take a pass.Very nice food selection and quality.  I'd give the food 4 stars, but they are a bit understaffed, because we spent 15 minutes at the front of the seating line after we paid and then our "waiter" took a while for the drinks.

And on that subject, why does a waiter have to bring you a glass of water or bottle of ketchup, even though you can go load up a couple of plates with $20+ of food on your own?Went for the Champagne Brunch for my Birthday weekend. I love a breakfast buffet.
It had a lot of shrimp which I love. An Omlete bar made to order - nice. But mostly lunch food is available.  Oh some peach french toast that was very good, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs and eggs  benidict.  Mini Bagels were cold and of poor quality. They really should replace those. Lox was suppose to be there but it was just salmon.  Surprisingly the champagne was good when pared with the food! I seldom like the taste of champagne so I was happy to find that I liked this one.  The dessert bar was not so impressive. Always the same. They should do a chocolate fountain or something impressive. Maybe even add an ice sculpture.  

Upgrade things for the price of $17.50 plus tip.  Because Golden Corral has a chocolate fountain and ice cream varities for less than $10 for brunch.  

Of course some of the resorts do the chocolate fountain also. I called and found one resort that offered Sunday Champagne Brunch with fresh pastries also but the price was $70 per adult. A bit out of my range.

I would go back just the same but not very often.  It was better than the lunch buffet I once went to here.Been driving past this restaurant for awhile, but when my roommate was looking for a place to eat for dinner, we ended up here.

The restaurant wasn't very busy when we arrived at around 7:50pm on a weekday night.  Since I snacked earlier, I didn't want to try their AYCE.  I ended up ordering their Pad See Ew (Thai-style stir-fried wide noodles), which came out hot (always a plus) and was overall good tasting.  However, all the Pad See Ew I have ever ordered in the past were made with a little eggs, and gravy, which this version didn't have (which in my opinion is more like a Chinese Chow Fan and not Pad See Ew).
My roommate ordered the Bento Box, which seems like an excellent value.  I didn't try her dinner, but it looked delicious, and she said it was very good.

Service was nice and friendly, but we were not very demanding and the restaurant unfortunately was not busy at the time.

If I am in the mood for AYCE sushi and trying out a new place, I will definitely consider checking out this place in the future.It's sad to read all the negative reviews of this place, and very recent ones at that; I must have lucked out when I ate here two weeks ago.

We got the corner seat outside on the deck, and this has to be one of the best views in Vegas: to one side we looked over their ornate pool, and to the other the skyline of the Strip. It was a bit windy (surprise, surprise) but not much of an inconvenience.

I had peach crepes with toasted pecans, and a side of biscuits and gravy and they were all way above par. Girlfriend had orange chicken which was OK. Our server, a dude from Pennsylvania, took good care of us. He nearly lost our mimosas to the wind on the way to our table but he recovered nicely.

So: maybe outdoor brunch is the best way to go with the Red Cup.Cool new Japanese / Sushi Place.  Power & Ray.

Some really cool unique rolls and tons of options for non-sushi eaters. I would say that the only issue they have, is that they do not have a Sushi ordering chart. You basically order the Sushi off the menu, so if you have a large group it may get confusing. I think they need to add a quick sushi ordering chart, so you can write down what you want. I think this will help the waiter or waitress as well.Probably my favorite thing to eat here are their salads - they are always packed with great tasting, high-quality ingredients (and tasty combinations).  They come in good portions, but honestly they are not as filling as other "salad" places I've ordered from.  I've tried their pizzas before, but have never found them memorable.  Their bruschetta was OK - again, not amazing.  Maybe I need to venture out and try more pizzas and more dishes...

Their service has always been prompt and friendly - I like how it is walk-up and pay, but you get table-side service afterwards... Pei Wei should do something like this.  They come by often for anything you might need mid-meal: extra bread, extra butter, extra wine (okay, maybe that's just me!).

They have decent wine (in case it's a liquid lunch ;-) ... hey, sometimes you just want to drink you calories) to accompany your panini or salad or pizza.  The seating outdoors is nice and relaxing when it's not over 100deg F!I come here every now and then with my boyfriend to grab a drink or with our friends to watch football. We mostly go because it's very close to our house. 
On the several occasions we've visited the food has always been good, but the service does lack a little bit unless you are sitting at the bar. I've noticed they don't schedule enough servers sometimes and I've had to wait up to 20 minutes on some occasions to be greeted...which can be very irritating if you're thirsty and hungry. 
Anyways, despite being inexperienced or slow the servers are usually pretty friendly. Drink specials are always decent.
If it wasn't right next to my house I probably would not visit again, but the good food, cheap drinks, and location will make me a repeat customer. 

if you aren't very understanding with sometimes slower service, I would try elsewhere.Moira isn't the best sushi I've ever had, but for Phoenix and my neighborhood and the pricepoint (as long as we don't order alcoholic beverages) is doable when we get a sushi craving. 

The happy hour is a great benefit if you can get away from work before it ends.  

Their spicy rolls are definitely spicy, and have some great kick to them.
It hits the spot without breaking the bank and we'll take it.Better than I expected, after reading these reviews.
Not as good as O, or LOVE.I need to preface that this is a bad review because I only had one thing and it wasn't even the Frozen Hot Chocolate. I'd thought I'd yelp it anyway to help with the ambiance because you may have visions of the new york serendipity as shown in movies, reality shows, etc.
After getting into Vegas- I had to hit up this place. It was 9pm or so and really was in the mood for one thing that's shareable and not a drink. 

We got the Forbidden Broadway Sundae which consisted of chocolate Blackout cake, ice cream, hot fudge topped with whipped cream. The cake was really thick- like brick thick and I think I needed more vanilla ice cream. If I just go by she said, my mom, sister and nieces had lunch there and shared a mac and cheese, blt, and frozen hot chocolate and thought the servings were HUGE. No kids menu so share.  My sister felt the water was g-ross.

As far as service- our little waitress girl was attentive enough, though I heard a table yell for her a few times. We were served by someone else and we had no napkins which gets gooey after awhile. 

I'll go back for the frozen hot choc.

Also- there is a window outside where you can order and eat out...but in the heat- eat/drink fast before your ice cream melts. And...kinda weird seeing pre-clubbers in mini-dresses down tons of food....but hey they can work it out.Cute. 
Cute name. Cute atmosphere. Cute presentation of food. Cute menus. Cute cute cute! 
But some of us would like more than cute from a world famous eatery thats been famed from a chick flick. 
The food was good.... but NOT for the price. 
The frozen hot chocolate was really good, but ive tasted similar things from starbucks for 1/3 the price and wait. 
However... I do recommend going to this place at least once. If youre a dude, make sure you bring a date. Not the type of place you go with the guys.frozen hot chocolate=amazingness in a glass.  it's so sweet and delicious and rich that my friend and i could barely make a dent in it.  i definitely couldn't finish it by myself...maybe if there were 4 of us we could have murdered it they way it deserved.

the potato skins and chicken tenders were cooked perfectly, and the sauces were really good.  the chicken tenders were especially light and crispy and possibly some of the best i ever had.

minus a star for the slow service.  we were here on a sunday afternoon, and it definitely was not packed. we were seated outside, and maybe they were understaffed or something, but i just remember sitting and waiting...a lot.  

minus a star for the price, too- i realize this is vegas, and i realize this is novel..but it was damn near $40 for frozen hot chocolate (which i think is $9-kinda ridiculous if you think about it.  really, it's a chocolate milk shake, and no matter how delicious it is, it shouldn't be $9), potato skins, and chicken tenders.  yes, the portions were huge.  yes, it's vegas and everything's expensive, i get it.  but still.  there's nothing really inherently special about the menu, and everything is super duper pricey- i remember seeing salads and burgers for $12-$15.  slices of pie for around $7 or so.  

the food is tasty, i'll give you that, and possibly hip and trendy...but as far as i'm concerned, not worth the $$ they ask you for.  i was lucky and fortunate enough that my girlfriend bought me lunch as a birthday gesture.  i'd eat here again, if other people wanted to go, and it was tasty enough that i'd recommend it to people..with the stipulation that it was very pricey for what you get. 

the atmosphere is cute.Because I loved the movie... I had to check out this place or at least say I've been to the Las Vegas location... It was after breakfast and not really lunch time yet so I decided to get a snack at the window line outside the restaurant.  There was a 45 minute wait for the restaurant dining so I didn't want to wait that long... but I did end up waiting over 30 minutes anyways outside. 30 minutes for a signature frozen hot chocolate that was $10 + tax!  Expensive!  It was good  and filling but not all that great. Yes, they should invest in more employees working at the "express" window because it took soooo long.  Thank goodness it was Feb and not burning hot outside.  I don't know if I will return to this location for actual dining...3.75 stars
So hot in Vegas it felt like walking under a hair dryer-constantly!  Craving a nice cold shake to cool down!  Sat at the bar with my 2 GF and ordered milk shakes.  took a while to arrive but the bartender was super friendly and attentive.   yummy and thick I deducted .25 stars as they were $10 apiece.Came here on a hot summer night and cooled off with a peanut butter frozen hot chocolate. You can't really mess up chocolate and peanut butter. 

For my meal, I had an ahi tuna salad. It was just ok. I wasn't too fond of the encrusted sesame seeds.I came here twice this month and the first time, my friends and I dined in the restaurant and the second time, we ordered at the to-go window and dined outside.

The dine-in experience I would give a 4 star while the to-go menu was disappointing and deserved a 3 star.

As for the dine-in, we waited about 40 minutes and they gave us a hand held alarm to notify us when we were ready to go up.  We had a party of 8 the first time and the interior is brightly decorated with a lot of pink.

We were seated and then proceeded to order drinks.  We came around noon so they still had the breakfast menu.  It goes until 2pm.  Anyhow, some of the people in my party ordered a few alcoholic drinks which they seemed to enjoy.  The real winner was the food.  The orders I remember were the steak sandwich and the waffles topped with all sorts of berries.  

The steak sandwich wasn't of the greatest quality but none the less, the size and presentation was impressive.  The bread was a little hard and hard to bite and hurt the roof of my mouth a little.  It also came with egg, bacon and of course, the steak.  All in all, it was an enjoyable and tasty dish which was big enough to feed at least two people.  That's not even including the french fries that came with it. 

I also ordered waffles with berries on top along with caramel and whipped cream i believe.   As for that, they were decent waffles.  Not the best I've had, but similar to the steak sandwich, they were of large quantity.

Service was great.  Our waitress was very polite, had a great sense of humor, and very prompt.  I think her name was Candace.

As for my second experience, it was pretty lousy in comparison.  3 of my friends and I went to the to-go window and ordered a few frozen drinks, hot dogs, and nachos.  We ordered the chili cheese hot dog, hot dog with sour kraut, frozen hot chocolate, and a berry smoothie.  The hot dogs were very disappointing because both the quality and the presentation were not to the level of what we'd expect.  I'd rather go to Pink's Hot Dog stand which had a more delicious hot dog at a lower price.  The smoothie I had tasted fine but didn't justify the $10 price that came with it.  

Anyhow, if you go here, don't expect the best quality food.  Expect decent food with a large quantity.  Avoid the to-go window at all costs.  Its not worth the price in my opinion.This was our first time going and I heard great reviews. We got seated right away which was nice because it was kind of busy. It took awhile for us to get service. Once we did we ordered a frozen hot chocolate which was to die for. We also ordered the veggie burger and meatball pizza. The veggie burger completely fell apart and had a bland taste, the meatball pizza was ok but hardly any meat on it. The waiter never refilled our water and he hardly came by our table. We even saw two groups of people get up and walk out because of lack of service. All together it was an experience but not one I wish to repeat. We will however be going to the To-Go counter for more frozen hot chocolate tomorrow!Came here for the first time to try the frozen hot chocolate with the guys. thought it was just a random bar from the outside. waited about 15 minutes so we chilled out in the patio out front and people watched. Text us when our table was ready. Server was very cheeful and pleasant. Took our order, 3 frozen hot chocolates, order of onion ring tower, tacos and sliders. Food came pretty quick, Tacos and sliders were okay, enjoyed the onion rings. Looked for our server and couldn't find him for awhile, our water glasses were needing a refill. overall good experience.Chilaquiles Verdes were AMAZING - 4.5 for those 

Unfortunately, everything else was sub-par: 
Fish Tacos - 2.5 stars
Veggie Tacos - 3 stars, wanted more veggies, less guac & pico
Chips & Guac - 2 stars

Would maybe come back for the Chilaquiles Verdes, but nothing else.  Guess I was expecting more from this place...(not to mention the female server we had was super rude)They have been good to us in the past but really screwed up. The dress hemming was okay but they took so much time, it was due saturday and they called us and said it wouldn't be done until sat at five, we said we couldn't make it then, so they said monday and we said we couldnt make it so we would go tuesday, they said okay and we went tuesday and it wasn't ready!  Also we paid ahead of time so no discounts were given. I expected better, very disappointed.The only reason I visit this Dunkin' Donuts a lot is because the one near me closes early.  If I have a late night craving for iced coffee, I have to go to Sam's Town.  Fine.  I love DD's, but this location is just so-so.  Depending on who makes the drink, the coffee is very inconsistent.  Every time, I get the same thing... and every time, it's like I'm getting a very different product.  At my normal DD's, the coffee tastes exactly the same each time.  Here, my fiancé and I have learned to order our drinks a certain way based on who is making them, and even then, we sometimes end up with a Frankenstein drink.  Also, the workers are usually friendly.  However, there is one young girl who is often there late at night who seems to get really angry whenever a customer walks in.  I really wish she would get an attitude adjustment, because it makes ordering something really uncomfortable.People always ask what Sumits is...it's a hot studio that starts with a bit of standing bikram, then four vinyasa style flows, then floor bikram - about 20 minutes of each with breaks and abs in between. Yoga is a practice, it's different every day for everybody and it's not a performance or a competition. The instructors here are good at reminding you to listen to your body and do only what it needs and wants to do.

The Groupons I've picked up for this studio make it worth it to me because I like going in and getting a good sweat on, but I don't think I would do a membership. The flow kind of bores me and doesn't feel like too much work. Honestly it feels like rich white people patting themselves on the back for doing what they deem "tough." Yes, it's hot and yes, it's work, but I'd rather be challenged to hold poses or focus on what the instructor is saying to think about where to move next instead of just doing the same thing every time. 

The people are friendly and the space is nice. I hear they are moving to a two-studio space closer to Shea during Fall 2012, so maybe they will start to offer a little more variety.Very tasty gyros with a pretty decent portions. They also have some American food items on the menu also. Good place for lunch if you work in the area. Prices are reasonable.I've been here twice since it opened, with good memories of one of their locations in OH from years ago.  Good service, with experienced waitstaff that recover from gaffes easily (such as not knowing their own drink menu during dinner service).  First time I had the shrimp and scallop risotto, which was poorly executed to say the least: rice was still overly al dente, sauce was thin and overall just needed a bit more TLC and it could have been good.  The second time I had the shrimp and lobster pasta, and putting aside the miniscule amount of lobster present (two small chunks for a very large pasta portion) the pasta was fresh made and done well and properly sauced.  For apps I have tried the carpaccio (not dressed with any olive oil or lemon and cooked) and the fried calamari which was passable, but not even to the standard of Cheesecake factory.  Finally, most things have been heavily seasoned.  All in all, I will probably end up giving them one more shotSo the place is good. I had some chicken teriyaki and it was fresh tasting and what I was expecting. The fried rice was my favorite because it was made just right and had all the seasonings. I want to give this place a 4 star but I'm giving them 3 because I immediately recognized one of the reviewers because of the picture working behind the counter and I don't doubt that another reviewer of this place is a worker either since they both have 1 review each. I would just think that it is dishonest of them to write their own reviews. If I'm wrong about them, I'm sorry but I still recommend trying this place sometime when you feel like eating somewhere new.if it weren't for the parking lot in front of lola coffee i'd give them another star. but construction going on right in front of your establishment with trucks everywhere is a hassle for anyone trying to navigate it. i had to park on the opposite end of the complex to run in and grab a cup of coffee, and convenience and quickness is always something i look for in a good coffee place.

lola is very cute and modern inside, i wish i could have sat down and enjoyed the morning rather than having to run off to work. the bar staff was super friendly and got my drink right away. iced americano. their little bar to get cream and sugar at is cute, with a big bowl of raw sugar for you to dive into with a tiny spoon. my coffee came up quick and i couldn't wait to try it. really, nothing special here. not bad, but not the best, somewhere in the middle. the place is similar to lux in it's look but the coffee just doesn't compare.Having lived in Texas for many years I used to love a cheap pizza buffet so I was excited to try one again...the only reason it gets 3 stars is for the BBQ pizza they have. I had them make me a fresh one. I love love love it. Always have. 

The downfalls were waiting at the counter and having to go find someone to pay, the crap lettuce for the salad bar, dirty silverware, dry dry dry pizza that was sitting there, and the worst part was the god awful loud ass music they were playing. The only other table in there kept saying how terrible it was as well. I asked the girl at the counter if corporate made them play that. She just smiled. Ugh. It was baaaad. 

I think I'll skip this place for now and remember better times in Texas.This place isn't the worst but not the best either.    The rooms are fairly updated and modern.   The walls are super thin, and the tall ceilings make any noise echo in the room, so it amplifies through the walls.

Breakfast offered is a mediocre spread.   The waffle mix could be better.

Free internet however, makes the star rating go up to 3 from 2.

Good for football fans in town to see their team play the Cardinals.A little underwhelmed by the much-hyped Chicken Tikka Masala. Ordered take out, added on the garlic naan and galub jamon. Specified a spice level of 5/10 for my 'tikka and order was out in 10 minutes flat, with a large side of basmati rice.

Chicken tikka masala was a good size for the $13 price tag, which included the rice. Garlic naan was worth the upcharge: delicious, soft, and flavorful, with a garlic scent that wafted through my car as I drove home. 

My disappointment came when I finally tried my entree. For a spice level of 5, I tasted absolutely no spice. And the sauce had a sweetness to it that I am not familiar with. It wasn't necessarily bad, but the dish didn't have the kick to it I was craving. 
Chicken in dish was in large chunks, sauce was a smidge on the thin side.

Based on other reviews, I'm going to have to come back for the lunch buffet and reevaluate.It's loud, trendy, outside,  it was okThis beautiful - and dark - steakhouse was perfect for our group of six on my last night in Vegas.  My $54 filet met my high expectations; I've had better cuts at the Capital Grille and other high-end steakhouses for $40-50, but hey, this is Vegas.  Excellent bread and parm-mashed potatoes, incredible miso-steak-butter.  Our server was attentive and funny.  All around a great experience, if you're okay spending some dollars.It wasn't that bad I came here expecting the worst because of all the yelp reviews. But it was ok. The crab legs were salty. I guess they did it on purpose so you could drink a lot of water and get full quick. But since we got the room credit from Vdara so the buffet was free. Overall, it was a pleasant experience.I really want to rate the place higher. I like what it's all about. Instead of pulling the building down and rebuilding something in that space, it has been converted to a community space. 
  I went to see one of their cult classics, and the staff was ok. It was completely amateur hour - I guess that's ok for the type of movie, etc. The problem was this was a sold out movie, and the staff brought in folding chairs to sit on to watch - that would have been ok before the movie started, but ithey did it one at a time making noise for the first 30 minutes of the movie - clanging, whispering, etc. Then they kept getting up and down.
  They seating was pretty bad. Low seats that reclined - normally that's ok, but there's usually some spring to it. These had no support at all. Halfway through my back was hurting and would have to readjust - but there was no comfortable way to sit in the chairs.I really like this buffet, but I don't take advantage of their offerings to get the most out of it.  There's a baked potato area with lots of fixings so you can make your own loaded potato.  I generally don't eat potatoes, so I've passed on this each time although I salivate when going by.

The Italian area has a cook to order section with ingredients such as shrimp, spinach, mushrooms, onions, peppers, etc.  I generally don't eat pasta, so I pass on this, too!  See a trend!

I do eat their loin of pork, the pepper chicken in the Asian section was great yesterday, and the pot stickers were good.  They have pork nuggets so you can put on your own sweet and sour sauce or Orange sauce which are in containers.

The one disappointment was they didn't have these melt away confectioner sugar coated cookies yesterday.  I really love those little critters.  There's nothing to them, and they almost melt in your mouth.  It's such a simple little cookie, but a dessert I look forward to getting.  They didn't have any yesterday!

I'll return.  One of these days one of the bakers is going to be mine!There has been some turn over at this location but I used to come here all the time and the staff was excellent. I can't speak to the recent changes that some people have been experiencing. Within the last year or so they have also done a pretty major overhaul to their menu. If you haven't been to a paradise bakery, it would be worth checking  out if your a fan of their style of fare.Overpriced with mediocre food, but the atmosphere was fun!Hanam's is situated on Victoria Terrace off the Royal Mile and serves Middle Eastern and Kurdish style food. The meals are not particularly cheap and not particularly special; my main course was basically a chicken kebab with salad, and cost around £9.50. The food was more like a higher quality version of a kebab shop, and though it was enjoyable it was hard to see why you would go there for a sit-down meal.
Outside however, you can sit on Victoria Terrace above Edinburgh's Grassmarket and rent out a Shisha; there are a variety of flavours, the staff will keep them working and they even provide blankets if it gets cold. Hanam's do not serve alcohol, however they are happy for you to pop up to the Castle Rock pub, which is a couple of doors down, if you cannot last a whole Shisha without a boozy drink. So if you're looking for somewhere to relax and watch the world go by, but you're not hungry, Hanam's is a great option.The Men's room was the worst thing I have ever seen in my life. They have one of those metal toilets that don't have a seat. It's placed between a urinal and a sink and it has no stall or anything at all that prevents people from looking at you when your taking a sh*t. I came in here to wash my hands and there was some guy taking a dump. The moment we locked eyes, he was like: "Sup?". I immediately just turned around and walked out. 

There is an insane amount of turtles here. Painted Turtles seem like cool pets, but they get pretty expensive and people just can't take care of them anymore. These parks are usually the place where people dump off their Painted Turtles, and for some reason they seem much happier here than in captivity. 

There is this dude that sells ice-cream in a truck here. Everyone kept telling him that he looks like Obama. He said that he gets that a lot. I personally thought he looked more like Tom Dubois from the Boondocks. Nice guy though. 

Personally, I prefer places like Floyd Lamb Park or the park near the Centennial Hills Library. But, this place wasn't all bad.First off, they do not have "all-you-can-eat" here. That's not a bad thing at all. I just thought I'd mention it, because we've come to assume that of sushi places here in Vegas and were a little surprised to find out that wasn't the case here.

Now to the real review:

The restaurant looks nice and the staff are fast and friendly. but they seem to forget little things. My husband got some sushi, and with it, came the usual pickled ginger, but no wasabi. Hmm... No big deal. Our drinks weren't refilled either without us asking. The food however was quite tasty and beautifully plated and also didn't take too long to come out of the kitchen. All in all it was a good experience, but it was a little costly compared to what we're used to here in vegas.I was booked here for a work trip, and well, there are pros and cons to being here.

Pros:  Friendly staff, especially the drivers around the property.  Your own kitchenette, so you don't need to spend an arm and a leg on coffee, and you have a fridge to keep your own stash of beer or soda cold.  An opportunity to enjoy a little respite from the craziness of Las Vegas. It was VERY reasonably priced.

Cons:  It's not on the strip, and getting to and from the property is tough if you don't want to walk, or don't have a car. Taxis must be called to pick you up.  The AC is very loud in the rooms, and does cut out from time to time.  The TVs in the rooms were Tube TVs, and the remotes didn't work, so I had to get up to do anything.  The wireless is shoddy, and tended to cut out frequently.  plugs for electricity were in odd places, if you wanted to do computer work in the room.  Dealing with the front desk was painful; to ask an in person question took me 15 minutes, and there was only 1 person in front of me.

That said, if strapped for cash, I'd do it again, but it would not be my first choice.Since we always have to pay a transaction fee for debit gas purchases in Cali this is just par for the course for me.  35cents on 25 gallons is a pittance.  I'm just happy to be paying $3.65/gal instead of $4.07/gal like in San Diego.  The tank of gas I got there to drove here was a hundred dollars!  So thank you Arco for having some of the cheapest gas around and at numerous locations.Good food but overpriced. C'mon we are in vegas. There are a lot places which are cheaper!!!!It's late night Saturday night and the MNers last night. Korean BBQ it is! We were forced to pick Sura because it was the only late night all you can eat option at the time. And when we got there they said they were pulling the food in about thirty minutes but we could just grab and eat whatever. They have a decent selection of seafood and meats and banchan. The food it set up like a buffet so you just grab what you want and start grillin!All around average greasy spoon with some vintage charm. The hubby and I came here for breakfast on the day of our arrival and the day of our departure. The food fills the hole, but there is not much flavor or creativity per dish.

Day 1-Arrival: We ordered the breakfast special for 5.99, which came with two eggs cooked to your liking, 2 pieces of toast of your preference and hash browns. The hash browns would have been amazing if they fried some onion in there, otherwise it was pretty flavorless.

Day 2-Departure: We ordered a pancake dish that came with eggs and we substituted the meat for hash browns. On top of that, we also ordered french toast with eggs and hash browns in substitute to the meat. It was A-OK!

Service has always been great when we have dined in. I mean the hostess can look a bit pissed at times, but our waiters have always been patient and quick. I also really like the fact that the floor staff also have to wear hair nets. 

Advice for future dinners--Do not expect fine dinning, its just your average greasy spoon, with average food.Convenient location on Scottsdale Rd. with a drive-thru. You know you are not in New England (the motherlode of Dunkin Donuts) when you see the small selection of donuts and bagels. We normally sit inside. The restaurant and bathrooms are clean and the staff is very helpful and friendly. The manager gave us a deal since they did not have the donuts that we wanted.Mimita's Cuban- Very Heavy! I didn't realize how much the Cuban cuisine centered around Starch. I ate several appetizers and bout time my entrée came out I literally could not eat anymore. My favorite appetizer was the jamon croquet. The Ropa Vieja was wonderfully seasoned and generous in portion. The dishes were with your choice of rice, congri, moros and tostones or plantains. I also tried the Malta which oddly enough tasted like molasses soda but complimented the meal well. I will go back here to investigate more.When I went here, seeking some cool refreshment to offset the fire from a Dom DeMarco's Big Apple Pizza, the place was undergoing remodeling.  So, it probably has a much less Spartan atmosphere than it did when I visited a few months ago.  The frozen yogurt tasted good, but, alas, although diners had a good choice of toppings, Hot Fudge was not available, and some offered frozen yogurt flavors were rather weird.

3-1/2 stars overall on this limited visit!Tasty. Best in Maricopa, ha ha.  Good for take away, but the dinning room smells and has for awhile. If they fix that it would help a lot!JD is awesome,  he picked  the perfect beer for us. 

This is a very interesting place.  I guess it's geared towards the college kids.  We got greeted when we first walked in, by a young girl.  She was nice, but seemed like she wasn't sure what she was doing.  We asked her about the bigger selection of beer, and she brought us this huge book.  Nice selection, but it would be nice if it was organized for different beers.  We like Double bocks and lagers. There scattered all over the book!  So it took use at least 45 min to look through the book.  We asked her for a beer.  She came back and said they didn't have it!  We were ready to bounce!  So then JD to the rescue!  He came to us and asked if we were looking for a good Double bock.  We said yes, brought us back something.  We only ordered 1 because it was in a bottle.  It was soooooooooooooo good!  So I ordered one.  The he asked us if we went to the cooler?  huh?  So he told us to follow him.  We went into the big frig.  There was so much beer in there I felt like I was in heaven....but I hate cold, so I had to turn around and leave.  My hubby came back with another bottle of beer he thought we would like.  So we opened it, and just the smell, I had a feeling I wasn't going to like it.  It had like a coffee smell, and taste, ugggggg, nahhhhhhhhh I don't like it, and neither did my husband.  And they didn't charge u s for it.  So for the beer, ok I'm down, but to eat there is a different story.  I watch people if I can.  This place, the girl that served the drinks also cooked the food.  I didn't see her wash her hands after she messed with the register.  I'm not down with that.  I will pass on the food.Freddy's is a good place to eat, when you hit them on the right night. We have been here 4 times in the past few months and it's either hit or miss. They always seem to pack the place, but that may be because of the price and the fact that we go on the weekend when there seems to be a car show taking place :)

Over all it's burgers and hot dogs. They are famous for their frozen custard which is awesome!

Last night the fries were very oily, I could actually see the wetness in them. They were good, but thinking about the oil was a tough one to swallow down.

I got a single burger plane with grilled onions last night, unfortunately not many onions :(

We will continue to go back, primarily because it's economical for a family of 4 and also the atmosphere is pretty neat.So, how much do you like hamburgers?  Do you like them enough to pay $8 for one?  Do you like them enough to willingly go near ASU?  If you're still nodding your head, chances are good that you'll like Smashburger.  

As burger joints go, it's one of the nicer ones--clean, stylish decor, and friendly employees are big pluses here.  You will pay for those pluses though, when you find yourself forking over more than $10 for the prototypical burger, fries, and high fructose corn syrup drink of your choice.  

What you'll get for that ten-spot is somewhat distinctive though.  Smashburger's claim to fame, of course, is the way that they seer the burger patty, thus getting it piping hot in a hurry.  What this means for you is that you'll be the proud owner of one of the messier burgers in America.  Grab plenty of napkins and plan to wear a shirt you don't mind getting greasy.  

I suppose the fries are a love em'/hate 'em affair.  If you're a traditionalist, prepare to be annoyed:  Smashfries are doused in oil and herbs.  They make a nice taste, but get old pretty quickly and I've never been able to finish an order.

Though hardly cheap or perfect, I like Smashburger on occasion as it's a nice change from the usual fast food fare.Finally got the chance to hit up AZ Cheesecake Co at the Farmers Market on Saturday.  I'm sorry to say but the key lime cheesecake just didn't move me.  I found it to be bitter and lacking any creaminess.  It wasn't bad but it just wasn't the flavor that I was hoping for when I picked it up.  The wife never shared her Peanut Butter one so I'll just have to go back and try something else.  

All of that being said, he always has a ton of different flavors and I'd reccomend following him on Twitter to see what he is bringing to the market each week.  Chandler is too far for me but I love that he brings the goods to me.  I'm pretty sure he delivers too so you really can't go wrong.Was craving korean food, so wandered lost at the Quad until I finally found it (You have to take the escalators that are just to the left of the hotel check-in desk). Restaurant decor is entirely unmemorable.

Was promptly greeted,  menu'd, watered. I knew what I wanted -- Kimchee stew made with beef... but I guess they pre-make the broth with pork, so I couldn't modify it. Bummer, but i'll roll with it. 

Banchan was rather late in coming out, the stew even later. When the stew finally made its appearance, it was mouth-puckeringly SOUR. I know kimchee stew is inherently tart, but this tasted like they added vinegar to it. The broth was also rather thin, not rich, and just not special. Plenty of kimchee in the stew, but they skimped on the meat. Banchan was spot-on though, well-seasoned, perfectly pickled.

More expensive than I'm accustomed to, and less  tasty, but will do in a pinch.Clean establishment with friendly service. Food was hot and fresh but on the salty side.  We had a turkey and a regular burger with sweet potato fries. Their beer and wine selection is very minimal and they were out of Merlot. Mostly a pleasant experience but a bit too expensive. It would be nice if they had a Kobe burger on the menu.Grind Burger is located off the strip in a hotel/shopping center area close to UNLV. 

It's "sort of" within walking distance of strip hotels, but only if you don't mind getting your exercise and sweating a bit in the Vegas heat. We initially chose this place for dinner because it isn't a crowded tourist trap, and it was dead on a Tuesday night. Our server and the bartender were friendly and helpful, but it took awhile to get the check at the end of our meal

They have a good happy hour, with $2 beer and specials on apps. However, the cheese sticks and marinara sauce were underwhelming and bland. The build-your-own-burger concept has been done better elsewhere (I live in California and like The Counter better than Grind Burger) but they do have some unique toppings here. 

Unfortunately, the burger was underseasoned and overcooked, and for the price, was a disappointment. Not bad, but not worth the expense, either.No CAKE POPS!  No chocolate chai mix!  Won't take my Starbucks card.  But at least it's close to the room elevators...It's a very nice atmosphere. The food is good. The Service is very good. The Biltmore is an amazing place and I think was looking for amazing. I had the chicken and goat cheese flat bread which was great. The next day I had their version of a French dip also very good.This place has arguably  the cheapest Japanese/Korean rice in town and a nice selection of things so its not terrible but, what was terrible was the food court. If I had the option of rating their food court I would give it a 1. 
So there I was, I was next in line the cashier lady turned away from me and started saying angry things at the bus boy or the kid who took the trays back.
It went something like this.

Old lady: Jinhuan u no gud

Jinhuan: I gud.

Old lady: No u no gud,

Jinhuan: I rear gud

Old Lady: WONGTONGBONGSONG!!!!!!!! U NO GUD

Me: Shil lyeh hamnida.... Excuse me....

*Stand there with a $20 in my hand... They kept arguing. So I walked away.*

I would go back for the Kimchee in the supermarket though.Quality of food is good and normal price. I personally enjoyed the fried steak breakfast. Pancake was good but a little bit on the hard side. Service was also a little slow and there weren't more than 5 people at the place.Hubby and I stopped in for lunch. It was just free they opened so it wasn't very busy. We started with the lettuce wraps a my hubby is a big fan of them at PF Changs. They were pretty good but a little salty for me. 
The honey walnut chicken was good. The sauce was different but I really liked it. The fried rice was ok but nothing special. 
Overall we had a good experience but the service was pretty slow so I would hate to see what it's like when they are busy. This was our first visit to the casino so I would give the other restaurants a try before returning.This place was pretty good.  Really expensive for two hot dogs, one order or fries and two beers but we were really anxious to try pinks since we had heard so much about it. I would probably go back but there are many other restaurants in Vegas I want to try first!Ok food, you really eat here for the star powerWhat can I say that hasn't already been said?  Well the Cabo Wabo Tequila shots are GENEROUS. Maybe someone else has said it, and I may have missed it, but if that is the case it is worth repeating!  GENEROUS.  It is like a triple shot! Which is good cuz it's like $9 a shot. Love this place!  Must sit on the patio!!! Excellent location for people watching, sipping a few drinks and chatting it up.  Food is mmeehhh... but I have endured worse.  Chips are good, salsa is okay.  I am a people watcher and in Las Vegas there are freaks a plenty!!  Plus Cabo has a fun carefree party environment with live music.  NO... it isn't the best live music, but it is entertaining while you people watch, chat it up with your mates and drink generous tequila shots.  It is what it is and what it is is good.Tried this due to the good reviews on yelp. Somewhat disappointed. 

The server was pleasant and food portions were decent size. But the food was a bit on the oily-side. Not what I expected I guess. 

Food was decent but not sure I'll go back on my next Vegas visit.This is a nice enough little place. The food is good, if not exceptional, and I like the variety of the menu and the Hong Kong style drinks and desserts. I have no complaints about the food. Everyone in the kitchen is on their game.

The front of the house is a different story. They have serious service problems. I know Asian restaurants are notorious for lousy service, but I refuse to give them a pass just because they're Chinese. I went there on a slow weekday afternoon, and I was one of four other tables. There was no one to greet me and show me to a table so I just wandered in. It took a few minutes for the servers to realize I was even sitting there. I observed another couple who also seated themselves and had to get their own menus and napkins. The servers seemed distracted and disorganized (or just plain incompetent) and didn't show any warmth or friendliness towards me. And there was a busboy who wandered about aimlessly, dripping a trail of dirty water behind him. I assume he didn't speak English because he didn't respond to any questions or requests, either from me or the people seated next to me. Needless to say, I didn't leave a tip and I doubt I'll be back.

Here's an idea. Only hire experienced servers who speak fluent English, understand proper etiquette and genuinely care about the dining experience. Take a lesson from the Strip, good food does not make up for lousy service. Unless you just want to be a carry-out place, put as much, if not more, effort into the front of the house as you do the back.This is panda, you get what you are expecting. The drive-thru is always super fast and I have never had an order filled incorrectly.

My only complaint was that on this visit the orange chicken was clumped together and not as good as normal.

I always order the spring rolls, they're my favorite.I was a bit dubious about a cafe that advertises coffee that doesn't taste like coffee but the espresso was decent. Not awesome but better than Starbucks.I love tapas, and I love great service, but this place feel slightly short for me.  I like this place, but I don't love it, and I really wanted to be wow'd by the food here.  They're in Aria, so I expected fabulous flavors and textures, but this place didn't deliver on either except for dessert [I'll get to that in a second].

I made reservations online for 4pm before a happy hour and Viva Elvis event that we had to get to.  We walked in and immediately loved the open feel of the restaurant; however, the decor looked almost tacky with those black, glossy leafless trees around part of the dining area.  Other than that, the layout was pretty nice and we were seated away from the crowd as i requested.

We started off with tapas and stuck with it rather than ordering a sandwich or paella.  From beef and cheese to an avocado cannoli, the tapas aren't even worth getting into very much.  I wanted that incredible flavor profile and excellent textures on the plates; however, the beef tapas, for example, was all soft with no counterpart, and the avocado cannoli was all creamy.  In terms of flavor, everything was seasoned as a restaurant of that caliber should do, but in terms of exciting my palette and making me say "mmm", it didn't even come close to a small smolder.

For us, the only great part of the evening involved their Santiago cake dessert served with turron ice cream was outstanding.  Talk about textures and flavors!  The cake was thick, moist, and had just the right sweetness to it.  The ice cream was incredible.  i wanted a huge gallon of that to take home with a side of almond cake [as in one whole cake, please!]  I loved every bite and would've bought another order of it had it not been for my distended tummy.

Overall, a nice experience and one I will go back to, but not for the food.  I'm going back for the dessert.The 3 meat pizza was excellent, the honey dipped pretzels would probably be better if I wasn't completely stuffed! And if you get and Arnold Palmer with the green tea its actually really good. And I'm not a green tea fan at all.

Oh yea, free WIFI too!!!I'm a sucker for tapas (or bocadillos in this case -- although I used to think bocadillos were sandwiches, which shows you how much I know, but I digress...). So, when I saw this place in Town Square I had to check it out.

First of all, there are 2 entries for Caña on yelp. Both refer to the same place but one has the address wrong. The correct address is 6599 Las Vegas Blvd. I'm posting my review under both.

Now for the review... Caña is located in the spot vacated by Louis's Fish Camp and they did a great job of remodeling the space. Louis's had a small bar and the entry way was a little odd -- kinda felt like you were walking in through the back door to get into the restaurant because of the small door, walking by the bathrooms and getting a glimpse of the "behind the bar" area before getting to the dining area. With Caña, the doorway is larger and more inviting and the bar is pushed back, adjoining the patio areas. The interior of the place is much darker and intimate as well. The bathrooms are in the same location but are not as pronounced.

As for the food... ehh... it was ok but not great.  Not even "really good" either.

- Hamachi ceviche -- as other reviews have mentioned they are not traditional ceviches. They're more like sashimi slices laying on a streak of citrus sauce. Hardly enough citrus to 'cook' the hamachi. It didn't taste all that fresh and lacked flavor.

- Short ribs -- one large short rib in a deep pool of guava glaze. The meat was very tender but didn't have much depth in flavor. A few more spices would have given it some kick and made this a great dish, but the meat all on its own was a little dull.

- Piggy back dates -- It seems like every tapas/bocadillos place HAS to have bacon wrapped dates. I guess I should be glad that this place did, because it was the best dish of the night. Great textures (although the amount of goat cheese mousse was overkill) and great flavors.

- Beef empanadas -- the outside of the empanadas was flaky and a little crispy. The inside could have used more beef. Almost every bite was pastry with a hint of beef. The beef tasted pretty good, I just wanted more of it.

- Crispy shrimp -- decent flavor, not as crispy as I would have liked.

- Sangria -- while it did taste good, it wasn't strong enough and was too sweet. It wasn't what I was expecting.

We sat at the bar on a Saturday night and didn't have any trouble finding seats. The service was very good. Our bartender was on top of things and we didn't have to wait long for drinks or food even though he and the other bartenders were very busy (all those mojitos take a while to make). Our bill came out to about $88 including tip for two people... not bad. However, I doubt I'll be back for the food. Caña might be a cool/chill place for happy hour but there are better places around town for tapas. I'd give them 2.5 stars if I could, but 'm rounding up.We had a craving for caramel apples. We normally go to the Rocky Mountain Chocolate factory but this is all we could find. I love caramel apples with coffee. Best thing in the world.

We got one and headed off to the gondolas. The caramel apples were quite expensive here. It was 14.00 for one. But what can you do when you have a craving. Needless to say it was delicious. Price and service however was alright.

3.5 stars.So I'm writing a review on the Apple Store ~ seriously?

~Yes, I must tell the world about my shopping experience ~ belch...

~No, it's a complete waist of time dude.  After all it's the Apple Store (angelic voices are singing in unison ~ "aaauuuuhhhh")

~Yes, I must let everyone know that this store's service has lost it's sizzle on the hizzle.

~No, it's still a waist of time dude.  Most peeps really don't care about the service ~ for it's an Apple Store with iPhones and stuff!!

~Yes, I must tell the masses about how they could receive better service by searching on line, talking in chat rooms and by YouTubing or Googling their questions.

~No, dude, for the last time it's the Apple Store! Most people don't even noticed their poor service because they are their to play with and buy an Apple product. 

OK then, I won't write a review about the poor service in this Apple Store that is located in the Arrowhead Mall.  But I will write about how they do have some really cool MacBooks, iPhones, iPads, AppleTV, etc.  

There are some very good people in this Apple Store that are very friendly and knowledgeable.  The key is to find them amongst the rest which are not very helpful....Bagel was decent and reasonably priced
Chai latte tasted a bit strange to me
Coffe was good
New place and a bit disjointed:
Menu says large and medium sizes, but staff says they only have large and small
Took our name when we ordered but didnt use it when the order came up
Brought some of our food to us but the rest they made us pick upIt took my fourth trip to Vegas to get to the sign. It's famous and now I can say I've seen it with my own eyes. 
It's not something I would go out of my way to see (sorry), but we simply happened to be passing by so we stopped. 
A must see? Sorry, but no.Sweet Surrender is a small candy and cupcake shop located in the Palazzo. The Sweet Surrender cupcake was esthetically pleasing and elegant with the pretty robin egg's blue frosting and vanilla cake, but lacked flavor, most notably in sweetness. The vanilla buttercream frosting tasted bland--there was definitely not enough vanilla or confectioner's sugar. Nice, friendly staff, just not sure how they will be able to sell a $750.00 cupcake if their normal cupcakes are nowhere near mind blowing.

I don't really understand why a shop like this would sell mass produced brands such as Jelly Belly and Godiva. Thankfully, they also carry other fine chocolate brands such as Marich's, Lake Champlain, Helen Grace, John Kelly, Hammonds, etc. I bought Marich's white chocolate coconut curry cashews and my husband and I devoured them in minutes! The cashews were uniquely delicious and the perfect combination of sweet, salty, and savory!Been there done that! I guess that's my outlook on the Vegas Rock N Roll. This was my first Rock N Roll event so silly me thought all of the chaos was normal. I had no business in the world staying at the Venetian - regardless of what the block rate was because I was so damn far away. I did so much walking prior to this race I am surprised I finished it. I have never seen so many people in my life! It took us forever to get to the start line and the lines for ladies restrooms in Mandalay Bay were sooo long. It was the dead of winter and freezing ass cold and windy as fuck! around corral 15 we decided there was no way we were even going to continue to try to push through the crowds to get to our corral, we ended up just huddling at the side and started with an earlier corral so we didn't freeze to death before getting to the start line. Yes, I am a CA girl so 40 degrees and windy is cold to me! Anyways, the course itself was flat and pretty easy. I loved running the strip - the excitement at the start line - took us through the first mile in what felt to be about 45 seconds, and we were lucky enough to be running past the Bellag just as a water show was going. The little white chapel was also a highlight for me, since I had never seen it. Fremont street was hard to feel out, we were there in gone SO fast. I did begin to drink water at mile 6 and continued to through mile 10 or 11 and did not get sick from it as others did. We did run through some very dark and deserted areas with some scary guys drinking 40s in the their yard (not a part of Vegas I ever need to see again). It was so crowded at the finish line, we managed to grab a bottle of water but didn't get snacks and did not want to wait in the enormous line for a finish line photo :( Not a lot of photographers along the route, so no good pics of us. The medals are awesome - they glow in the dark. The end of the race is an experience I want to never relive again in life and its painful to even recount. 44k runners and I don't know how many spectators stuck all over the strip, in the Mandalay lobby, on the monorail, taxi lines and streets was the worst ever! Then the rain started, OMG - this is when the tears came. Unbearable! WALKING back to the Venetian after this mess was a nightmare. I arrived at the expo Saturday with about 30minutes until closing so everything was pretty much shut down. Bib pick up was easy, shirt pick up was fine for me (although they had run out of men's shirts by then). I skimmed through quickly and left. I don't think I'll ever run Vegas again - if I do, I need a much better plan. It however, has made me grateful for other races - anything seems small and organized compared to this.The place itself is nice! Lots of room to move around. The waitresses are top notch Hotties!!! I actually thought it was too much light. .This place is not as busy as it looks. The only problem I have is that at around 100-130am I asked one of the hosts if they can move  our table up front to where the dance floor was. He said we have to buy more bottles. Funny, there were lots of empty tables. I thought it was bullshit. @ LAVO. they moved us to the dance floor once the people left and it started to thin out. The music was eeeeeeeeeeeeeh. OK i guess. not the best. I still had a great time.The Hot Dog Stop first captured my interest when I saw a review come up for it that had just been posted.  The review was for one star and did not sound too complimentary.  I read the other reviews and saw a crazy mix of low and high.  The five star reviews are funny because A) It's just a hot dog place, and B) They are clearly done by people without a lot of reviews which leads me to believe they are posted by owner/insiders etc.

Anyways, I decided to go eat here with my kid and see what the real deal is.  This was pretty close to the Dave and Busters we go to play video games at so it worked out this weekend.  

The dogs - I like the fact they use Sabretts for the dogs and I thought they were really good.  I got the chili dog.  A previous reviewer said that they did not get enough chili sauce in the cup, but I found it to be more than enough of a serving, and I like a lot on my chili dog.  I would have preferred the chili not have beans in the sauce as I do not like chili with beans on my dog due to the texture of the beans.  Wolfe's brand coney dog sauce for example does away with the beans and I like that better.

The fresh-made hot dog buns were a winner.  They were really nice, held up well, and tasted great.  These make this shop worthy of a return trip or two.  : )

The condiment bar had onions, pickles, lettuce and tons of other toppings for the dogs.  They also had ketchup, mayo, mustards, relish and bbq sauce in the squeeze pumps so there is no reason not to get a dog exactly as you like it!

The fountain drinks were refillable - and overall I really liked the menu.  Lots of options to try in the future (although I always judge a hot-dog place by the basics).

I think I met the owners who did inquire if we enjoyed our meal, which is good to see.  And the store was clean, and had a good amount of business going on.   So for this, I break out three stars.  I think it was A-OK, and is a welcome addition to my list of fun places to go.

The only reason I cannot see four or five stars is only because it's not a steak house guys.  I also do not think it deserves one or two stars as that would be underrating them.  If it were a chain, then one or two stars would be expected, but look, this is clearly a home-grown fresh start at a hot-dog place, and the home-made buns really differentiate it.

I'll definitely be back.  Enjoy!!Went on Sunday for breakfast.  Small menu.  Food was ok.  Had a nice young server that was just amazing!  No one else was overly friendly but Tyler made it a good experience.this review is based on two weekday visits, seperated by a time of six months. 
first visit, I was practically ignored by the bartender. the crowd was modest, easily could have been covered by one server or tender. my son spilled my modelo, and the bartender noticed the incident, went off to retrieve a washcloth and then never came back. I was sitting about 5 feet from the bar in the large table. I finally had to walk behind the bar and get the damn towel myself. and, she never did bring me another beer, as I requested. 
Plus: the menu for happy hour is limited, but the 3 taco sampler I got was mouthwatering. very very tasty, cooked right and appearance was 4 stars. 

second visit: enjoyed a warm welcome from the manager, seated promptly, again, happy hour menu did not dissapoint. still, the bartending staff here has their heads up their asses. too bad, as well, since they have great variety of real tequilas and decent prices for good mexican beer like Bohemia and Negra Modelo. 

the salsa variety is decent. when the weather is nice (7 months out of the year!) the patio is a great place to enjoy company who has passion for real mexican food OR a great place to bring your visiting friends and family. 
Food, atmosphere, staff 4 stars
Bartending skills, 2 starsI stayed at the Planet Hollywood Towers for CES this year.  If you're looking for some sort of Vegas experience don't stay here.  But if you're desperately in need of lodging or if you're looking for somewhere a bit more quiet, the PH towers are a good option.

So, I found out that I was going to CES this year two days before CES.  This doesn't allow for much time to plan and doesn't allow for many options for accommodations or flights.  After scrambling to find a hotel and doing some hardcore sleuthing on google/kayak/orbitz/travelocity/farecast/etc, I can up empty handed.  Empty handed being Circus Circus, Stratosphere or off the strip hotels (everything else was solid booked) and a $780 non-stop flight from Oakland to Vegas or SFO to Long Beach to Vegas with a 6.5 hour lay over (again, all other flights were solid booked).  Fail.  I considered driving.  Or not going.

I couldn't not go, however.  Some intensive googling (read: 4th page of results) led me to a shady looking hotel broker site (http://www.bookit.com, slogan: "You know what to do.")  They had rooms available at the PH towers, and not only that, they were 40% off.  Of course this was a scam.  Or was it?  I called PH reservations, they said "we're all booked", I said no, the *towers*, they said oh yeah, plenty of room.  I said why.  They said, uhhh it just opened on December 28th and nobody knows about it.  (It wasn't even listed as a hotel on hotels.com, travelocity, orbitz, etc).  I went back to bookit.com and "booked it" hoping that I hadn't just screwed myself.

When I arrived in the carport area of the Towers, there wasn't a single person or car in sight.  Hmmm.  I went inside (everything was brand new, uber modern theme) and up to the lobby.  At the front desk there were spots for 20 reservationists but there was only one person there checking people in.  When I got up to desk, she looked up my name... long, anxious pause... she pulled it up, and everything was fine. 

Some stuff about the Hotel that the website or brochure won't tell you:  The towers are mixed residences and hotel accommodations.  The main entrance is located off of the back end of the Miracle Mile Shops--a mall of questionable quality and curation.  It's a 10 minute walk from the hotel to the main PH casino and hotel.  There's something that looks like a bar in the lobby of the Towers but I never saw anyone there.  There are no restaurants.  There are no usual hotel amenities--spa, starbucks, gift shop, etc.  The pool area looks more like a public swimming pool and faces one of the main roads off of the strip. Room service has limited hours and it made me wonder where the food comes from since there's no dining establishments in the Towers. 

On the plus side, the rooms are brand new studios, 1 bedrooms and suites.  My studio was small by hotel room standards and average by Manhattan apartment studio standards with a view of the MGM but not the strip.  I think I might have been the first person to ever use the room.  It smelled like cleanliness and there was no sign of anybody ever having occupied the space.  The room came with a kitchenette, full set of dish-ware, a dishwasher, full wall to wall, floor to ceiling windows with a remote controlled shade.  The linens were stiff and nice.  The bed was firm.  The towels shed lint everywhere, I presume from having never been washed and dryed before (they were brand new).  The toilets are black, which is weird (use your imagination). 

One of my favorite parts of Vegas hotel rooms are the completely opaque shades that can make 2pm seem like 2am and help you recover from something that may have ended at 7am.  Take note Empire Today... make shades that block out all light. 

Ok, I should wrap this review up, but I thought I'd provide a little more info since this is *hopefully* the first review of this hotel.Such a lovely cosy place to sit in..
Felt like walking into someone's living room..
Would be even better if they actually light up their fireplace. .

Stumble across Nom de Plume..was kinda hungry..
Looked at the menu ...yay..French Onion soup...on a windy night...yummy..

Went inside.  Ordered the onion soup and a BLT roll..really wasn't expecting too much...

Onion soup was delicious, rich in flavour but not heavy or overpowering, generous portion too..came with two slices of bread with butter..bread made by Manna House...no complaints...yummy...was nearly full when I finished the soup...it was very tasty.

BLT. ..it was alright....I added another sachet of mayo..hehe..

Lovely quiet place..
Although food isnt outstandingly good but will definitely be back, it's the atmosphere that makes the difference and the onion soup!!I wanted to be blown away by a gourmet taco shop, but sadly I live in Southern California, and when you live there being amazed by tacos take A LOT. I definitely recommend this place, but it doesn't have the WOW factor.

The Pros:
Awesome Salsa Bar - about a dozen delicious salsas. The regular Mexican salsa was flavorful and spicy. Some nice rare options too.
Service - Our server was very nice and attentive.
The Al Pastor - I tried the premium carne asada, fish taco, and al pastor. This is the only one I would go back for - great taste and tender pork.

The Cons:
Price - Like double the price of what I'm used to paying for any kind of taco.
Pepsi brand soda - Hells to the no!! and they didn't have Mexican coke either (they were apparently out).
Bleh on the fish taco - again, I am spoiled because I only eat fish tacos in Baja, but the batter was very soggy and bland.

Small place and tight parking but it wasn't crowded on a Sunday.Hubby and I split the fried chicken and waffles.   The chicken was good, not great.  The waffle was hard.  The biscuit was crumbling and flavorless.  Yes, the portions were large, but who cares if the food isn't that terrific?Went there on Easter Sunday and even tho it was not packed they took about and hour and a half to bring our food . We asked what was taking so long and they said they were running slow . They were very polite that's a plus the food was very yummy and big but I gave it three starts because they took forever to make waffles and eggs :/I have only been to America's 3 times and every time I try to have something different because I always hear people rant and rave about it.  I only give it 3 stars because the food is just fair in my opinion.  I have been to other places that have better tasting carne asada and a better selection on salsas.  I think they try and put amodern twist on their tacos but sometimes simple and old fashion is better than "fancy" ingredients.

I will probably still go there if I need a carne asada fix and cant get to Tucson but it isnt someplace that I would take people for anything authentic.We have been here repeatedly and they have good and bad days regretfully!   The food is always decent to really good - just a bit pricey for what you are getting.  The service is only why they are not getting another star.. the last two times we have been there - we may not be returning.  How hard is it to toast a english muffin?  and burnt is burnt... the orders even were wrong the last two times we were there.The new caramel flan frappacino is awesome! Don't usually go to this location but happened to be in the area. When I walked in, the barista said hello, but after waiting in line the young man at the register just stood there and looked at me. No hello, may I help you, what can I get for you....nothing. Come on guys, your better than that!Busy Busy Busy!  Seems like everytime I go there is a line out the door.  Our entrees were good as usual, and I don't mind the wait.

If  you don't like to wait in line to order your food, you might want to consider calling ahead to order and pick up your food.

The location is usually very clean, loud either from the music or people talking, but there's also an outdoor area you can eat at.

They have very good guacamole for a fast food place, and the tortilla chips have a lime-salt flavor that accompanies the guacamole really well.We ate here for my friend's birthday. They pulled off the "Hollywood" theme of the restaurant very well as you can see (http://bit.ly/fHPGmV) It was fun to take photos with Rocky in front of the restaurant.

My friend and I shared a Philly cheesesteak, and I'm glad I did because it was delicious and filling. My other friend ordered the burrito, and she had to take it into a to-go box because she couldn't finish it. Overall, everyone seemed pleased with the quality/quantity of the food for the price.

I docked off two stars because of the service. Our waiter was unfriendly and seemed in a rush all of the time. When we were split our bill, he didn't give us our change because it would be too "inconvenient." I'm not complaining about losing a few cents, but I thought that was very strange.Very young crowd and very crowded. Drinks at some of the bars are OK. Didn't gamble there so can't tell ya how that is.We rented a car from FOX for our budget trip cuz it was hella cheap. I'll say you get what you pay for.  We were expecting a 96' 2 door Geo or something based on our first impression...being far away from the airport and the caddy shack place they call their office, but instead, a brand new 2009 Ford Focus waiting for us....just fresh off the car wash. We were actually shocked. Then said "Awesome!" considering we only paid $50 for 4 days. There was only 80 miles on the odometer. The car was extremely clean and still had a strong scent of the new car smell.

Pros: 
- Cheap, cheap, cheap
- Brand new car
- Didn't have to wait too much...maybe 5 minutes?
- Reasonable if you are on a budget.

Cons:
- Main place In a place far, far away. You actually have to take a shuttle from the rental car place, after you take the rental car shuttle from the airport.
- Main office is just a portable. Looks kinda' scammish but after checking our credit card statement online....whew, no extra wierd charges.I love U-Swirl, but this particular location is in a not-so-good neighborhood, so that kind of brings it down a notch. 

Pros: It's self serve. There's lots of variety when it comes to the flavor of the yogurt as well as the toppings. The place is clean and the decor is nice. It's refreshing to step inside, but for the most part that only accounts for hot days. They have a frequent Swirler card. If you buy 9, you get the 10th free. When I bring my friends, they count them as a stamp, which I love! 

Cons: This place is freezing! I realize that comes with the territory, but if I come here on a cooler day, I struggle to keep still. I can't even have a seat inside. The seating outside is terrible! Again, I realize that comes with the territory because the surrounding neighborhood is not so great, but you would think they could try harder in preserving their tables. They're dirty, graffiti is etched into them, and some of the umbrellas are missing. I also don't like the customer service I receive here. The cashiers act like their customers don't matter. I often have to wait five minutes for someone to actually show up at the register because both people working are in the back and don't immediately come when I call. During this time, my yogurt continues to melt. I also think they could do a better job with keeping their toppings fresh. They aren't covered and often times are stale.Order online and track your delivery!  Except it was 20 minutes later than the tracking said they left the store.  Dominos is pretty consistent with their pizza.  We ordered 2 medium 2 topping pizzas $5.99 each and then $9.99 for 14 wings.  Bill came to $26 so I am guessing there was a delivery fee which I failed to check. 

Pizza #1 - Thin crust, extra bbq sauce, chicken and pineapple.  It was perfect.  I wish I had some right now.

Pizza #2 - regular crust, extra Robust tomato sauce with jalepenos and pineapple.  It was pretty good though I preferred the other.

Wings - Spicy and "slimy".  I don't know what it is with these places.  Seems I have only had non-slimy wings from our friends at BWW. Hm.  (anyways grilled them up and they were better)

All in all this is Dominos-nothing real special -just the usual chain place pizza. Nothin too crazay.... its just a "quick lets order some fast pizza cuz I don't want to cook right now" place.the place is ok. i got a horrible blowdry & style service from a couple of stylists except for one in particular, paula.

i have been getting consistently good hair services from paula for a few mos now. i would recommend paula over the salon itself.Todd, the Bartender is amazing.  He remembers my order and provides for a great experience every time.  The waitresses are rude otherwise.  If you eat the wings or pizza make sure you got an easy out to a bathroom within 30 mins of eating because the spices kick it up a notch.  Love the fact thaf they got Stone IPA on draft, but wish they had a bigger kraft beer selection.  This place is never crowded..I have previously visited the Sin City Brewing in the Flamingo and I think that one is better.  This location in the Venetian isn't in as good of a spot.  I also thought the service at the Flamingo location was better, the girl helping us here was off putting.  The beers of course are the same and I guess that's what really matters but if you want a better atmosphere go to the Flamingo location instead.  The beers are ok, kinda of similar to other Nevada beers, being more on the light side.Normally going to Vegas I would never rent a car but I did need to go outside the strip and found a great deal for a compact car through hotwire.  From the airport there is a shuttle that takes you to the car rental place which is all in one location.  The Hertz counter is up the escalator on the right.  I did have to wait a while for a rep.  She did do the normal questioning about upgrading to a convertible, then a bigger car, then one with power seating, and then finally how i was planning to fill up gas and insurance. Not having power seating was a bummer but not the end of the world and the car came with a GPS so that definitely is a plus.  However, that GPS definitely took a very very long time to find a satellite. Supposedly Nevada has a law that does not allow car insurance companies to deal with the car rental places but I still opted out since I wasn't going to be there long and NV drivers are definitely much more tame than drivers in the DC area.Better than papa johns right next doorThe food at China One was pretty good, but my Chinese tastebuds are pretty hard to please. The trick was that the place was really busy, but we got to the front of the line so fast we didn't really have time to look at the menu before ordering... so we ordered what we thought were individual plates, but turned out they were a couple of ginormous servings... But again, the food was decent. I might go eat there again.= = = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =


I have been back to #1 Eastern here since my last update, but it's been over a year since saying anything about it, so here goes:

Robyn N. & Mike C. joined me today, & both of them have been here before as well.  Meanwhile, #1 Eastern here has changed hands recently.  There aren't any major changes, & they still have the same Mongolian BBQ fellow.  He's good, but they have reduced the meat choices from 6 to 5 though, & the place has slipped a little overall in other ways as well.  For examples, the BBQ grill had to be started AFTER Robyn & I presented plates to be cooked, somewhat after opening time, leading to a long wait for our food to be cooked.  Why didn't they fire up the grill BEFORE they opened?  Did they think they wouldn't have any customers?  Actually, they DID have fewer than any of the other times I have been here, but things were going well enough by the time we left around noon.

A couple of other missteps today were that they didn't keep the sauces, such as the Egg Foo Young gravy stirred, the Kim Chee was too salty, & the chocolate & vanilla soft ice creams  were backwards in the machine.

As I keep an eye on nearly 200 buffets around the state & watch them either gradually fail, these are the small details that I have seen grow & grow.  Pretty soon you are seeing empty serving trays, lukewarm "hot" food, & then before long, a "CLOSED" sign.  Take Great China Super Buffet at Bethany Home & 15th Av. for instance.  It opened at 5 Stars, everything right!  Then, it was down to 4, then 3, now it's closed.  Hometown Buffet in Scottsdale is another place on the same path.  It was great for that kind of place, 5 Stars!  Then it was 4, then 3, & only 2 the last time I visited.  Poor selection of food, empty trays, snarky employees, missing tableware, poor food temperature control, & so on...  a place now begging to go out of business!  Customers gone?  Of course!  Who wants to still go to a place like that?  The only reason it was still open the last time I went seemed to be because it is owned by the parent company, & both the building & land are paid off so they don't need much business to limp on.  Otherwise, I think it would have been gone a long time ago.

Meanwhile, in the past year we have seen certain buffets such as Crazy get BETTER, & terrific new ones open, such as Hibachi Grill (2 open, 2 more under construction).

You have to stay ON TOP OF THINGS at a restaurant, & #1 Eastern is down to 3 Stars right now, as I see it.  Let's hope they give it a little tune-up before it's too late.  They used to have a line out the door waiting for available seating at 11:30 AM, including on weekdays!

Lunch Buffet $7.99,$7.20 Sr.OK cupcakes.  I wanted more flavor and sweetness.  The service was great, and they are talented artists.Our biggest problem with Bacio was the inexplicable length of time it took from when we ordered our meals to their arrival at our table. An hour and fifteen minutes, despite being only one of TWO seated tables in the entire restaurant on a Thursday night.

Our waiter, whose name I wish I could remember, was amazing: attentive, polite, personable, and honest. He did the best he could given the other let downs we experienced during our dinner. 

As for our meals, we were all very divided. I ordered some sort veal dish, which I really enjoyed BUT I have had better veal on numerous occasions. It was a forgettable albeit filling meal. My father-in-law had veal prepared in a different fashion that was too salty for his taste. My husband had a surf and turf combo on special and it was decidedly the best meal on our table. The other two members of our party had a salad and lobster ravioli, which were "fine" and "good" but again, they've had better. It was a mediocre experience, and when I'm in Vegas I like to kick it up a notch from mediocre. 

Bacio exudes an upscale modern vibe but falls flat in the taste-bud department. This is not a Vegas-must.I've been meaning to try this place out, since it's in my 'hood, and was pleasantly surprised.

I thought I'd try their carne asada, since they're down the block from the wonderful Asadero Toro. Everything was great... the beans, thick and flavorful, the rice spiced deliciously. Grilled onions. A freshly deep fried jalapeno. Smoky hot red salsa.But the beef... left a little something to be desired in texture, though the flavor is great. The portion os huge, but I'd prefer a more traditional flank/skirt than the eye of round or whatever it is they are using. It's a little gristly but not fatty and charred.

However - the flavor and cooking were so good that I'll def be back to try a sopa, torta, or for breakfast. I could see writing a 2nd review with 4 stars. The 3 is only because of the cut of beef used for the carne asada. 

I photographed my food and the menu - uploading shortly.Well hot dog..we missed happy hour! But i heard it was awesome!!

Came here for dinner with my work folks, but I was the only one who ordered sushi!

We had gyoza and spring rolls for the table and I ordered:

1. Spicy Tuna Roll - Not bad, the spicy tuna roll is like a benchmark for me. The sushi rice was a pretty good texture, but the spicy tuna was not very spicy.

2. Blanco Cabo (or something like that..) - This was a fancy roll. The fish was cut too small and rubbery..It was decent enough to make it through half the roll, but I just wasn't feeling it.

3. Sake Nigiri - Not too bad on the Sake Nigiri...they didn't skimp too much on the fish..and tasted pretty fresh. 

There is something to be said about sushi restaurants that have more drinks on their menu than food... -____-;;My wife and I dropped in for Happy Hour a few days ago.

I was sort of on a sushi kick. I was excited to come try this place out because the happy hour menu looked really good with reasonably prices. (I checked it out online). 

We walked in and the place is really cool. 

It's got a nice layout and a good feel to it. 

The hostess sat us down and the table was really dirty. It was sticky too. We had to ask a waitress to clean it for us. 

Then came the flies. Man! There were flies all over! That was weird. 

So we look at the menu and we order. 

Las Vegas roll, 2 California rolls, that dumpling thing and edamame. Seriously. The prices were so cheap! Very good reason to go. 

I liked it! I've had better Las Vegas rolls at RA and Kabuki, but for the price? I mean we got all that aformentioned stuff for like 20 bucks. Not bad! 

My wife thought it was, "eh". I think I'd only come for the happy hour though.The Club Tavern is an interesting bar. It has a wide range of crowd members from the youthful to the middle aged.  I've been to this bar on numerous occasions for volleyball, and hanging out. and for most times its been a pleasant experience. The drinks are fairly priced, there is a lot of space so you don't feel crowded and usually the music is fair. 

Some points of concern though arrive with smoking. When will they make it a state wide band to smoke in bars and restaurants.  The bartenders also seem a little snobby on occasion. 

I wouldn't say this is the bar to go if your looking to have a great night but if you want a fun/interesting night with some interesting characters make sure you visit.Grade: C

Chain food. Okay service. I can't explain why I don't hate this place.Slightly lower than average Hampton Inn.  Heat/AC wasn't updated, pretty typical besides that.This is a dank little place! And I don't mean that in stoner-speak.  It is literally a dank, dank, little place.  Granted, I'm from Californy and I'm not used to the drippy August humidity that was in effect when I visited, but wowzers was it steamy and dank in there.

There was an impressive assortment of vinyl for sale! I found quite a few little gems.  If you've got itchy, black tips, then definitely stroll through there.  It is an interesting digging experience! 

If you're sensitive to inhaling mildew and perhaps exotic molds, then I'd bring some air filtration apparatus along with you.  And the record sleeves on the damper side of the shop had water damage.  Beware!  But check it out.3 stars is sufficient..... I feel the prices are on the high side...Yes, I know it  comes with a small salad, bread, a drink (iced tea or milk is included, but not soda....go figure), & a small cup of ice cream, but it still seems a little pricey to me. 
I felt like the portions are all not that big.  I love the Mizithra Cheese...So yummy! But there were a few times where I felt like they didn't really give you enough on the spaghetti.... I felt a little gipped.  
If you really want Italian Food, then go to Oregano's instead!...NOW we're talkin'!Had lunch here today with a friend. The place looks like a total hole in the wall dive but it is clean. The service was good, attentive and lots of iced tea (one of my pet peeves) so I can't complain. We both ordered sushi and it was quick and definitely tasty- but damn was it expensive (I totally should have read reviews before going). For the two of us, a tea, a water and a few basic rolls, it was $40. It always cheeses me when places don't offer a good lunch special. 

Oh well, it tasted good and didn't kill us :)We paid $28 for Easter Brunch last Sunday. The menu selection seemed good on paper-and the food wasn't bad-just didn't wow me enough to want to go back. I was pleased with my yogurt starter, although my friends at the table were complaining about the thickness of the avocado gazpacho and comparing it to guacamole. 
2nd course the crab omelet was pretty tasty. I was totally looking forward to sampling my mans' strawberry brioche french toast but it was a disappointment in special-ness. 
My 3rd course was supposed to be mousse-stuffed strawberries but instead it was mousse with strawberries sprinkled on top. The pumpkin bread pudding my man ordered was better. The artisan cheese plate my friend ordered was SUCH a dissapointment. ONE piece of cheese to try? C'mon people. We overpaid.http://stevelerer.com

While in Phoenix for the NASPA conference I decided to try a Man vs Food restaurant with our friends Michelle and Keith. Alice Cooperstown makes no attempt to be anything besides it's namesake. This is a place that is all about music, beer, and bar food across from a stadium. We arrived and sat outside while we waited to order. I decided to go all out and order the "Adam Richman's" Bases Loaded  Big Unit hot dog. This rediculous hot dog was a 22inch Vienna Beef dog loaded up with their "nightmare" chili, bacon, cheese sauce, sauerkraut, jalapenos, tomatoes, onions, relish, cheddar cheese, and a boatload of fries. A short while later the unreasonalby large dish arrived at our table. 

This is a true foodventure statement. I do not like hot dogs. But for the love of eating and the spirit of the list, I dove right in. I will say that this was a hot dog made with good meat though after 4 bites I was pretty much over it. The toppings were intense, it was really just everything possible piled high on the dog. As you obviously determined this was a knife and fork affair and it took some time. About half way through I hit something I had never hit before, the dreaded food wall. It was time to buckle down and make this happen. It took everything I had to go bite by bite but with the cheers of Keith and Michelle, I reached my final bites. After what I would say was a half hour I downed the final bite and stood up victorious!

Our time at Alice Cooperstown was fun and stomach busting but not necessarily a place I would frequent if I lived in Phoenix. Michelle, Virginia, and Keith said that their food wasn't bad either. 

Overall Review: 5/10Sunday V-Day 

Empty and boring. The service was oddly slow and odd in general. The waitress was overly nice and I swear she was Minnie Mouse @ Disney for a year or two. 

The food was good but not great. Everyone liked what they had but no one had a overwhelming time. 

The stadium was gross and ugly compared to the regular season vibrant green. It seemed a little sad. LOL

Although I did not have anyone sitting with me while trying to eat, I did have a man cleaning his washcloths in the sink. He was clean and friendly but I thought it was funny.Modified as we know it now is going bye-bye. The owner, Kimber Lanning, is handing it over to a husband and wife duo, and the venue will be remodeled into a more traditional gallery with some smaller shows catered to progressive and experimental music. Here's the link to the article about the change... http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/uponsun/2009/09/kimber_lanning_parting_ways_wi.php

This is such a bummer since some of my favorite artists have played here. Although there are still some good venues for indie artists, there aren't a whole lot in the downtown area. I guess all I can do now is hope that someone else will come along and start up a place like Modified.We ate lunch there on a weekday in early 10/04.  The Welcome is a restored 1930s diner and seating consists of just nine (counter) seats.  It's definitely cramped, but that means you'll get to converse with your neighbors.  The menu is quite limited, although the food was good.  However, they don't give you plates and the food was *very* greasy (our sandwiches came on a piece of waxed paper and the grease quickly soaked through the paper onto the counter).  The other thing I didn't like, was that you had to *buy* (bottled) water if that was your drink of choice.  They had a cook, a helper and a waitress working in a VERY tiny space....the waitress was o.k., but the cook and helper were pretty friendly.  It seemed that everyone but us was a "regular", which was kind of fun; we had an amusing conversation with the three guys (co-workers) who sat nearest us.Papusa, its fun to say and also to eat.  Paaaa poooooo sahhhh

I went in with a few coworkers time time with the goal of ordering 100% papusa. Which I did including a new Jalapeño papusa. 

This new Jalapeño papusa at $2.00 is .25  more than the rest but well worth it. Lightly spicy cheese and corny it was great.

I also had a cheese papusa but it was just bland.

The chips and salsa were like that of any Mexican place now, no more popcorn tasting chips. The side of Salvadorian slaw was nice. 

On a fun side note my co worker got the "French style chicken"  which was 3 breaded chicken breasts over pasta with a lemon butter sauce.  What compelled him to get French food that looked like Italian food at a Salvadorian place I will never know.Eh, i liked it with the other management before they fired everone and hired uber trendy "cooler than you" people.  They still get decent shows and have some great beer deals but man.  its so clean now.  And the girl jeans wearing crowd has moved in on certain nights.  Dont get me wrong, Ill still patronize when they have decent shows, but it's not the kind of place you go after work to unwind with a beer and good conversation.

One thing Ill give them props for, the be your own f-in DJ night. Great idea where people show up with random records and get to spin them.Yeah, yeah it's Starbucks. Everyone knows it tastes like burning, yet we always go back for more. Typically I'd not even write a review for such a giant chain, but this location does have a unique vibe that sets it apart from the rest. The staff is psychotically cheerful, and ZIPPY ZOOMY FAST. They can work through a line of 10 people with speed and composure that could humble Speedy Gonzalez! Also, the vast patio is dreamy, and is always buzzing with eye candy. Score. The big downfall, however is the iced coffee. Weak. Like.. 85 year old woman who reuses her Sanka grounds kinda weak.. I've had this problem at other locations, but certainly not at all. Buh. Ambience, and experience, however, are how this transformed from a 2 star review to a 3 star review...I wish I could do three and a half stars for this one.  

We called for takeout.  I got the vegetarian soba noodles with tofu, and my husband had some shrimp and beef thing.  When he got home and I opened the boxes, mine had chicken in it...I am vegetarian (okay, pescatarian, but anyway...:)).  Luckily, we weren't in a hurry or anything, so we both just hopped in the car and went back.  

Now, the food was really good once we finally got to eat it, but I have a confession...I topped mine quite liberally with some Sriracha sauce before tasting it.  I don't know what the noodles actually taste like right out of the box.  They could be amazing, or they could be quite bland.  Whoops.  With Sriracha, they were pretty much mind-blowing.

We'll definitely try them again - I'd really like to try the tofu steak with mushroom sauce that Kerstin mentioned.  And next time, we'll be sure to check the order on the way out.God bless Rolberto's for being a hop, skip and a stumble from home.  Thanks goes for being open 24 hours - especially on late nights when I need some greasy carby goodness to soak up the alcohol and prevent the hangover from hell.  Everyone - you can categorize this with all the other Erto's (Filiberto's, Raliberto's, etc.) 

I must admit I have never had Rolberto's sober or during the day, so I can't vouch for food quality.  But I'm sure it's shitty.  As a matter of fact ,Sunday morning I had to deep clean my kitchen because I was about to hurl from the residual stench of the food.  But that is neither here nor there.  Major points go to Rolberto's simply for providing another alternative to barfy fast food and the Gay Denny's.  The chicken torta and carne asada burritos are good (read - digestable).  But don't blame me if you get sick!!This is my go to lunch spot by work. Service is quick and the food is good. Definitely order the hot salsa with your food; the regular salsa is kind of bland. Menu is full of Mexican/American favorites. Nothing is really spectacular or revolutionary, but it's all pretty solid. I've never been disappointed.

If you're looking for decent Mexican food near the Biltmore/Camelback area, this is always a good choice.Meh, service was decent, vegetarian options were not that great. Water was tap, and the food was not fresh. Nothing special about this place, but it did not make me puke.

Had the vegetarian enchiladas and they were not that flavorful.

Price for lunch menu was cheap, under $10. 

Would I go again? No.
If someone took me there, would I go...sure...Fresh fish in Phoenix.

Say that 5 times fast. Maybe it'll come true. Or maybe, just maybe, you'll find yourself at The Fish Market. 

For lunch, I had their smoked salmon and tuna. I also ordered the artichoke heart. Mmm. I was anticipating something mouth-watering - a lunch meal I had to rave about later. What I got was pretty okay. The fish was cut up into chunks (yes, chunks) and the artichoke was pretty bland, despite how super yummy one can be, if prepared right. 

Price was reasonable. $5 for the 'choke; $8.50 for the salmon/tuna order, that came with some interesting sides: tasty pesto, crunchy crouton bread-thingys and this white stuff i had no idea what it was (no, it wasn't tarter; i tried it).

The menu is large. It's hard to decide. Crab. Oysters. Fish tacos. Smoked Salmon. Shrimp Salads. Oh my.

The service was decent - the type you appreciate at the time but can't really remember a day or two later. We got warm, fresh bread brought to our table, too, and plenty of drink re-fills. 

Overall, a good lunch. If I ever went again, I'd order something else. Too bad Phoenix lacks fresh fish options. Because, if this is as good as it gets, I better pack my bags tonight and hit the road for Seattle.Met a friend for Happy Hour here. This place wouldn't be at the top of my Happy Hour list but far from the worst. I didn't realize The Armadillo Grill was more of a bar. Food was OK and service was consistent. The place wasn't too crowded. Now that I know what to expect, I would be happy to return here for Happy Hour. Cheers***ok place..I wanted to like Hillstone before we even entered the restaurant.  The patio is charming and romantically lit, and it wasn't overcrowded.  We were brought to a large booth in the back of the restaurant with a party of six and while I enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant, I have to say I was less than impressed with the waitstaff.  The first server who came to our table (who was apparently only there to take our drink order, but didn't tell us that so it was really confusing when a different server showed up a few minutes later), literally COULD not understand what we wanted to drink.  I was with two moms-to-be who both wanted club soda with cranberry juice and a splash of pineapple, which I'll admit, is a little random and high maintenance for a nonalcoholic beverage but the server should have been able to handle it.  Instead, she just kept saying, "So, Absolut and club soda and what?" "Absolute and pineapple..?" These women did not want vodka in their pregnant bellies! It wasn't even particularly loud in the restaurant, I think perhaps Hillstone is just doing its part to hire the hearing impaired. Although she finally seemed to grasp that they were ordering nonalcoholic drinks, I seriously wanted to take a sip of the drinks first to make sure they weren't spiked.  The whole exchange was just weird.

The "real" server wasn't as bad, just kind of inattentive and awkward.  I did enjoy my food though...I got the spicy tuna roll salad which was really interesting and tasty and everyone I dined with seemed to enjoy their dishes.  I'd consider coming back for the food and the ambiance but it's definitely not one of my favorites, there are better places in town for the price.Not a bad place, coffee was above average and breakfast was good but not  spectacular, I do admit the toast was the best  and the two ladies were very friendly. I am not sure if I would go back unless I am really feeling lazy.I'm surprised at the amount of bad reviews!
We ended up here on a Sunday morning for the breakfast buffet.
It has a lovely old feel..dark paneling and booths. I think I would have enjoyed that more for dinner, with a roaring fire in the winter. 
For a sunday morning, it was really dark.
The buffet was really good. You can't really mess up breakfast. A nice selection and friendly service.
$16 was pricey but i think pretty typical for a breakfast buffet at a hotel.Liked this place. Got my eyebrows waxed here and most likely going here again. Everyone was nice and they accomodated me even though I was a walk-in. But I was VERY pregnant and I thought she would help me lay me down or at the very least get up, but she didn't. Love the prices and hopefully will be pleased when I get my nails done here.Meh. 
Its good. I have been here before...its just not the best. 

I had a bad craving for a falafel sandwich, only pita jungle is a bit more of a drive from my work. So I called up Saba's and placed a pick up order. 

When I got there, I was promptly ignored and not greeted even though there were 2 people behind the cash register. The old man grunted at me and pointed at the order I just watched him bag up (I had placed an order for 4 people, nothing crazy by any measure) I asked if I could give him half cash and the rest on my card...I get another grunt (more of a disapproving grunt), this clearly put him in a bad mood. I said thank you I don't know how many times, but that wasn't enough. 

When i got back to work I was a bit disappointed. I ordered a side salad with my falafel and the house dressing was some really weird dressing I have never had, though the lettuce was very fresh and crisp...My falafel its self was ok. The patties were good, the pita bread got super soggy really fast and I was sad to see no onions or cucumber or hummus in it like pita jungle does. 

If my co workers wanted to go here again, I would most likely order something else and give it another try, but wouldn't suggest it if it was up to me.Stopped for a quick gyro to go, not bad but the cucumber sauce had overpowering garlic added, very bitter and bad taste left in my mouth for hours!

Girl at the register was stunningly beautiful, will return for another try!Bowling alley's make me so happy. I love the sounds of the pins, smell of musty shoes and the bowling alley bar. 
This establishment has nothing really exceptional to offer, but served it's purpose with a fun evening surrounded by family and friends. 
We came with a group of 16. Did the "all you can eat" pizza and bowling deal. 15 bucks a head. 2 hours of bowling. Ball and shoes included. I'm not one of those people I wish to be with my own snazzy shoes and ball (insert Christmas list here). 
Standard surroundings. Looks like they "upgraded" the bar, which in my opinion made it worse. Keep with the shady feel if you aren't going to upgrade the entire place! It was empty and the bartender was also a cook, waitress, and helping out front with check in's. 
Anyhow, we had fun. There were some mishaps... Like "all you can eat" being 3 large pizzas for 16 peeps. Keep a reserve or something! I had to continually check on the food... The "10 minute" prep time they actually told me was 45. So order early and assess appetites. 
The staff was nice enough, but seemed young and overwhelmed. 
All and all a good time. Was just a bit stressed having to keep on the staff so much and having to monitor the whole time. 
Now if only I could break 100! A 97 and 99!? C'mon! ;) 

*Side tip: If you sign up for summer bowling '11 you get a tattoo parlor giftcard. Nifty!!!Expecting good food. Was disappointed. The meat had no flavor. The tortillas looked good but were yellow.changed planes here on my way home from New Orleans. This airport was clean and seemed new. There was a Nathan's in my terminal so I got a delicious wiener before boarding. A pretty decent airport, much better than either Denver, Saint Louis or Philadelphia!Par-- Expensive parking, some good food options, befuddled terminal layout

PHX is okay as an airport. Once you've been through departing a few times, you learn the terminal layout and parking options.  But on first experience, it's a befuddled mess.  Knowing the parking layout isn't easy. Numbering system is inconsistent. And you see people struggling to tell their ride where to pick them up on a regular basis in baggage claim. At-airport parking is also very expensive at $25/day.  

To its credit, PHX does have some good eating options.  Better than almost all other airports even.

Other than that, it's a messy design, the place is showing age, and you have to budget extra time in case there is traffic.  Guess that's the price of having a downtown airport.  I'd love to see them build a modern international airport in Buckeye.  They have enough land out there and (with the new loop) it would balance out some of the traffic load so the highway around the airport isn't so congested.

Better bet is to park in the Spot parking at E 40th and Van Buren.  There is a covered option and they zip you right in.I came here to grab a quick coffee and snack. 

The coffee is a little watery and run down wouldn't suggest it. 

But the cookies, bread, and muffins are super yummy! 

I might have eaten the entire dozen of cookies I bought for the crew but nope I was good!This place is a hidden treasure.  3 different restaurants on the same grounds, all hidden away from the rest of South Phoenix.    Good food, good service, outdoor seating, beautiful grounds to stroll around on, plenty of parking, a cute little vegetable garden, a country store and much more.We went for the lunch special. Most of it is premade and sits behind the chefs. Its all very rice heavy so I suggest the sashimi instead if you want to get your fish on. 

Its fair and the price isn't bad and the staff is very friendly and attentive. 

I recommend driving down to Mido Sushi for the all you can eat special.We decided to end our Summer Vacation at On The Border!

Josh took excellent care of us!  We sat on the patio all by ourselves! 

The chips were really great and the salsa was a bit more intense than usual, which was fabulous. We found out OTB doesn't have pickles for their kid's burger.  The Mahi Mahi grilled tacos are really tasty. 

It was a great ending to our Summer Vacation fun!Schmeh, it's ok.  I think we like it because it's way close to the homestead, but it's not worth a special trip.  The gyros are cut so thin that they tend to crumble when you eat them, and the chicken gyro is not tasty.  The greek salad is rather lackluster, but the fries are crisp and hot and the pita is soft and tasty.  Still searching for the perfect gyro in Phoenix and this is not it.  Still, if I'm craving gyro in a hurry, Niro's is passable.I really only go here during happy hour.  I like the Tsunami Punch, vegetable tempura, calamari, pot stickers, Saki Bombers, California Roll, Tootsie Maki.  It's impossible to have a conversation with someone due to the loud music.Stayed here with my husband for a national conference. The resort took great care of the conferences goers. Breakfast meals were especially wholesome with lots of fruit and protein, no greasy quesadillas or deep-fried doughs. 

Saturdays were kid central with the water park, but the rest of the week was quiet and relaxing. Definitely take advantage of the adults only pool on the weekends.Kitschy.  The view is spectacular.  The smell from the bull outside as you're walking in is not.  The bull totally fits the idea - setting the scene for the old west and showing you what you're about to be eating, but the smell is far from appetizing, particularly after the "rain."  I was taken off guard when the soft-spoken server mentioned the slide, and wasn't really in the mood to try it myself, but I did see some others give it a go later.

We were promptly seated by the window, where we could get a good view of the guys who were lassoing the wooden calf out front.  It was charming to be served beer in Mason jars, even though the selection of draft beers could have been larger.  The fry bread we had while waiting for the rest of our party was good, though the chewiness indicated that it wasn't that fresh, but the cinnamon butter made up for it.  I opted for the Vaquero,a smaller steak served with cheese enchiladas.  The steak was decent, but the tortillas of the cheese enchiladas were quite chewy.  I think I should have opted for the filet, which my dining companions all got, and it came with green beans and corn.

Would I go back?  Maybe if I had kids and was passing through town.  Otherwise, I'll be looking for somewhere with more focus on the food than the theme.I've driven by this place for years.  The parking lot is usually pretty full.  I finally stopped in here for lunch.  Plenty of choices on the menu.  Jamie was a pretty good waiter.  Apparently many of the all day specials have gone by the wayside recently because of the economy which has hurt the lunch crowd but not the breakfast crowd.  My turkey club was ok but not great, I should have gotten the cole slaw rather than the fries only because of the volume of food (and my waist).  Traditional diner with decent food and pricing, I may go back again.the food is very good here but the service isnt very nice. they dont greet or thank customers properly. i dont know why the owner is so mean when i come here all the time. so i have to give it three stars for the bad service they need to learn better customer service or at least some mannersMy boyfriend loves loves loves this places pizza.

To be quite honest yes its good enough for 9.99 mon-wed for 1 topping. I refuse to spend more than that here unless my bf is craving it.  Personally id rather go to bashas down the street for 6.99 for pepperoni pizza freshly made when you call.  So far i still have yet to find a pizza joint where i LOVE LOVE LOVE their pizza so much that i crave it. I don't know exactly what it is that i do not love this place just as much as my boyfriend... the grease maybe? i am not a huge fan of drippy pizza. i do not care about the stretchy cheese not being real thing i just want pizza with awesome flavor. If we don't get bashas i am okay with this as long as it was only 9.99. Have not tried any of their calzones or wings, someday i will though. Skip the fried zucchini and mushrooms not that great here.Need to improve service. The cashier is nice but slow. Drinks came out slow. They had one training barista making all the drinks. He kept asking questions to the cashier. It just looked like they didnt have enough people working. My drinks were not up to par. The only nice thing was one drink was free because it was taking them extremely long. It just didnt seemed well managed. I would rather drive little bit farther for better experience.This review is for the Garden Center only.

The flower selection seemed to be fairly limited but the prices were descent. They have a good selection of planters and I found a couple that I really liked. Herbs were incredibly limited and those that they did have looked horrible. Tomato and pepper plants seemed alright. The Home Depot at Mesa Riverview has a better garden center all around but I would still give this location another chance.

One of the cashiers outside was standing at her register playing on her cell phone while the other cashier helped everyone. I went to the cashier that was doing her job and she was really nice.

Next time I will go to one of the many nurseries around the area. Home Depot is good for other home improvement needs. Gardening, not so much.I've been to Sekai a countless number of times, but I have to admit that it's not necessarily my all-time favorite.  The quality of their fish is always great and their wait staff is usually fast and friendly - but their all around quality/quantity of their rolls and meals goes back and forth - sometimes it's great, sometimes not so much.

However, I will admit that it's probably one of the best sushi places in Mesa - so if you're looking for a place in the vicinity, Sekai is likely your best bet.Late night waffles and other breakfast foods at an affordable price.  Worthwhile if aren't afraid to dine next to big scary bald men with tattoos on their head.  Mostly friendly servers, plus it's nice to see them make your food.For a hotel in Mesa, the Hilton Phoenix East has actually been an enjoyable home away from home for me. Since my house flooded two months ago, I've been living here at the Hilton and have enjoyed my stay and the amenities they provide. The pool is nice, the food isn't bad, and the numerous events and groups they have hosted since I've been here have offered an interesting mix of people to mingle with.

They also accept pets which is one the main reasons I decided to stay here, and are conveniently located right off the 60 at Alma School Road across from the Fiesta Mall. I've upgraded rooms twice now, my first facing the hotel parking lot, my second facing the pool, and my current balcony suite facing out from the front of the hotel. The concierge desk and complimentary shuttle has come in handy, and I've used their laundry service on multiple occasions as well.

One really enjoyable perk has been access to the Executive Lounge on the seventh floor, which provides access to a free continental breakfast in the mornings, and free appetizers and drinks in the evenings. Although this access is included with any suite room stay, it can also be purchased separately if staying in a standard room. The hotel restaurant and bar are also nice, adding to an overall satisfactory experience.I love the $6 Guac/bacon cheeseburger, and the ice cream cookie sandwich...but that's it. If ordering chicken in the drive thru...expect to wait...and wait.This has become a recent and decent go to hangout when I'm in the area. I've always liked Old Chicago for their beer selection. At this location I've had everything from a hamburger to pasta to pizza and it's always been satisfying. As for the beer, I love the rotating seasonal selection, the happy hour prices and the mixed beer concoctions such as the snake bite (guinness and cider).

Nothing super special here but it's comfortable and I'll certainly return again and again.This place isn't hard to find at all.  It's on the north side of Broadway, west 1-3 buildings of Mesa Dr.  I would love to give a better review / rating, but my experience was just okay.  I needed organic chick(en) feed, but it wouldn't be in until Thursday.  Seems they order baby chicks about once a week - something I couldn't find in any reviews - from Murray McMurray hatchery.  I'm curious if they'll add a partial order to their weekly order; this would save a huge shipping cost and potentially a large order requirement.

Selection was decent.  Employees were empathetic, friendly and helpful.  Prices were okay - nothing to write home about, but also not a huge gouge.  I look forward to dealing with them more, and hopefully updating and positively increasing my review.Stop by for dinner last night and place has good food and service was attentive here. Prices are good and the atmosphere is good. I be back later to see if the place stay consistent with service and food.Decent food. $8 dinner with leftovers. Good bang for your buck. Staff awesome!  Building was sorta old, but clean!Well this was the last buffet in Casa Grande for Rand H. and I to try. The place is a little old and beat up but not to bad. The buffet was small for a Chinese buffet (about 25 items) and everything i tried was good. So for $5.50 I left the place quite full a pretty good value meal but if I had a list of Casa Grande buffets they would be at the bottom. Will I return? no.Stopped by La Famiglia after a shopping trip at Frys when we first moved to this area. 

Was having a hangover of epic proportions from celebrating at my friend's wedding ... And, as the story usually goes, I needed some food and water, stat.

We both got two slices of the cheese pizza and drinks. 

Now, is this the best pizza in the area? 

Absolutely not. But if you're in the area running errands (or struggling from the night before), this is a great place to grab a quick slice for an affordable price.This place is a lot bigger inside than it looks like from the outside.  That was kind of startling.  The food is good and I look forward to going back.  I think my ordering could have been better but what I got was enjoyable.  The service is spotty and we had to wave down our waiter whenever something was needed. The kitchen was able to turn out our order quickly though.  Everything on the menu is reasonably priced.I shop here because it meets the time and distance parameters of my life.  One more block and it wouldn't fit, and I wouldn't miss it.i come here almost every other morning to pick up a bite to eat before i head towards my long boring day at work. Since i have time on my hands i do not mind the slow service. yes this Einsteins bagels is a GREAT deal slower than the one off of mcClintock and Guadalupe and actually now that i think of it once they screwed up my order and didnt realize til i was 15 minutes down the street :|

majority of the time they are just average. if they screw up my order one more time though im sticking to the mcclintock and quadalupe location. Fast and Efficient. 

Like jennifer said though...its not severe enough to keep me from returning. i just want my bagel and honey butter for the day!I use to go there every weekend for dimsum.
I didn't mind waiting 30 min to get in, the food was good.

BUT...one day I saw food from the cart dropped on the floor, and the manager came quick and put that food back in the plate and served....
I could not believe my eyes.

That was the last day for me and C-Fu restaurant.Typical big box store.  I like Lowes but this location lacks customer service.  Get a piece of wood cut, forget it.  Lost rebate for paint, makes me doubt the corporate structure.  Home depot down on Alma seems like 5 star service.We were in the mood for a burger with my daughter and her friend so we went here.  We ordered apps and about 5 minutes later, our entree.  Apps came out quick and were pretty decent (jalapeno coins, onion rings and chips).  However, right on the heels of the apps came the entree's.  We had just started on the apps so the table was jam packed with food and dishes.  Take a tip and delay ordering your entree on a busy night.  They were clearly about turning tables, but the server was pleasant and not pushy.  I ordered the "burning love" burger.  Definitely not as hot and spicy as the description made it out to be, but decent which sums up the restaurant.As far as coffee shops go, this one ranks as "OK"... The beverages and snacks are good, but the staff could use a few lessons in charm, or at least what it means to work in the hospitality business. Product, pricing, location, selection and cleanliness all rank 4 or 5 stars, but the blank looks and extremely bored attitude of the people working here drag the businesses overall score down.More and more nightlife keeps popping up in G-town (aka Gilbert) and Crabby Don's is at the height of it all. This relaxed bar, located in a strip mall, offers a full menu with seafood offerings. Drinks are cheap. And the bar has turned into more of a club after 9 p.m. where you'll find bands like the Phunk Junkeez taking the mic.

And the staff here is nice! Still waiting to meet that Crabby Don.I've been here a couple of times and some old friends love this place and have them cater their parties all the time. I've had tacos and enchiladas, but the Pollo Rico (crispy chicken burro with jalapeno cream cheese and cheddar cheese) is by far my favorite. 

The food here tastes lighter than most Mexican food places.Went here on the way out to the airport after our family holiday visit.  The place accommodated our large party with kids and the server was great to split the checks.

The food wasn't anything fantastic unfortunately.  I had a chimichanga and it was "okay" -- I probably wouldn't come back on my own, but was good for this group with some picky eaters who want things that are predictable.

I prefer my mexican to be more authentic.  The service was great though.I cant say i was amazed! The salsa was good/average likely and the food was about standard, nothing that i would write a 5-start review about. .we ordered the app sampler plater, everything was covered in beans and lettuce, it didnt seem as if there was much attention to detail or taste. I will have to be in a generous mood to give it another shot. .Average lamps store.  It is a good place for purchasing lamps.  Slightly expensive at times.Decent enough El Cheapo Mex.. we grab dinner from time to time and its not great by any stretch of the imagination however in a pinch it'll do. The carne asada burrito is pretty good.. decent meat quality with good salty meaty flavor and plenty of pico de gallo.. good times! 

This has to be one of the lamest Yelps Ive written to date.. gawd, I'm so uninspired these days! I need some hot sauce splashed in my eye to make me hot and spicy again!Whenever we go to a party in Paradise Valley, we book a room here and take an Execucar to/from the party so we have a place to crash.  We don't like driving down the dark, unlit streets of PV and especially if we're going to have a few drinks.  This hotel is very convenient for us to stay in those situations.

Luckily, we've stayed here before, so we're familiar with the room layout on the property.  However, the first time staying here is a little disorienting because the buildings all look alike and the numbering system doesn't make sense when you're in the middle of the property.

As described in my prior review, the rooms are ok.  They're larger than most rooms by today's standards, but the decor is a bit dated....it's fine for our needs.

Return Factor - 75%I dropped in for lunch today.  I ordered a small salad and 12 wings which were both good.  The wings were good, hot, and cooked perfectly---I just wish they offered 6 wings instead of 12.  My salad looked fresh (sliced tomato, sliced white onion, green and black olives) but they did not have blue cheese dressing AT ALL.  I did not have the pizza---the reviews about the grease was disturbing and I know I cannot handle a bunch of grease.   Dining area was clean, it looked clean behind the counter, customer service was good and food was fresh --- keep in mind that I came around 1p-ish on a Wednesday so they were able to take their time with perfecting my order.I'm torn about this place. I wanted to love it but then didn't. :/

We ordered a couple different things when we were there... Started off with the Pate Maison... It was okay. Not terrible but not amazing. Next we tried the Dungeness Crab and Truffle Omelette which was very good when you got a bite loaded with crab and truffley goodness. The bad thing is that those bites were few and far between. This was a full on omelette.... There was SO much egg. I could barely taste anything other than the egg. We also ordered the truffle and parmesan fries and they were amazing- we loved them!

Strange that french fries would be the highlight of our meal... I would like to go back sometime during lunch though. Their chicken salad sandwich and their chicken and brie sandwich both sound awesome.I work near this Ra location, which is the only reason I end up here when I get a craving for a spicy tuna bowl. 

It's just like all the rest...too loud, random happy hour, obnoxious and rude hostesses, nice bartenders and late hours (which is a bonus since everything else short of the OC closes at 9!!!). BUT, I do enjoy that spicy tuna bowl for lunch!!

Also, they do have a 'Nooner Card' that is stamped for each lunch you have and after I think 8, you get a free one! That free one always seems to taste soo good!!

The rest of the sushi is average and predictable and their iced green tea is good. I honestly recommend just getting it to go and saving yourself the rest of the experience!Eh, it's Taco Bell, so expect fast food, chain restaurant Mexican that tastes like the price you paid for it. The staff here are friendly and are good at marking your items so that you don't get the "extra sour cream" burrito mixed up with your regular one.Picked up a dozen bagels & bialys and sampled the corned beef.  Unfortunately the corned beef is at best a good goyashe corned beef, not Kosher or Kosher style.

The bagels and bialys were top notch though.  Great selection.  What's the difference between a bagel and a bialy?  A bagel is boiled before baking, a bialy is not.  Bagels have a chewier hide.

If you enjoy noshing on bagels (or bialys) I recommended getting them here.  It's about 9 bucks for a dozen and they are so much better than anything you'll find at the grocery.  We're talking east coast quality bagels here.Heard about Urge Salon and its owner Denise through a chat with a woman named Patty I had sat down next to at Hopdaddy's bar last month.  Called soon after our talk and tried to make an appointment, but Denise's calendar was almost booked solid through the new year.  (She had a couple of spots open, but my exercise and work schedules wouldn't allow me to commit.)  I had some free time today and called to see if she could see me.

Denise asked me a few questions to see what I was looking to resolve in this visit, and then offered to let me change into a smock when I quickly begged off to look for a shirt in my car to change into, since I was feeling too warm in my light sweater in her warm salon.  (She remarked that it was supposed to reach a high of 81 today.)   Ahh, much better.  Still, I found it too warm for comfort during the 55 minutes I was there.  I'll make sure to plan more carefully on my next visits.

I have to admit, I wasn't fawning over my haircut as Denise was doing her finishing touches, but after raking my fingers once or twice, I thought my hairstyle looked fabulous!  Mom immediately loved it, as well, and as some of you may know from reading my reviews of other salons, she is a hard woman to impress!

I didn't know that Denise/Urge Salon did not accept credit cards as forms of payment- CASH OR CHECK ONLY.  Strange, I thought, not to accept CCs... I've heard of many small- to mid-sized businesses turning down Amex, because of the fee Amex charges per transaction, but Visa always works, but not here.  Thought I'd give you fair warning.  I had just pared down the cash I'd been carrying, because I don't feel secure walking around with it, but I did have enough to cover what she charges for a woman's cut and style ($55), minus the 20% discount if you, according to Urge's website (and on the Yelp app), "call and book an appointment today."  There's a nice check-in offer of 30% off on your second visit, as well...  

Denise was friendly and easy to chat with.  I wasn't a fan of sitting on the "booster chair," even though I offered to sit on it after she mentioned its availability.  (Truth be told, I was expecting a thick chair pad, or two, and not one of those foot stools one keeps in the kitchen to access hard-to-reach shelves, but oh, well...)  I really liked the specialty chairs she has at the washing stations, though!  As you sit down and lean back, you bend your knees and place your feet at the end of the chair pad so that the chair reclines in such as way that your neck sits comfortably on the sink- pretty cool!  No more of my neck feeling stiff while getting my hair washed- yay!  (Although, I guess this only works if the customer isn't wearing a skirt, or other compromising piece of clothing!)

Hope to be able to bump up my rating to four stars on my next visit!This is not our favorite Mexican restaurant but we have been customers for 12 or 13 years. If we want Mexican food we can get to this store in about 5 minutes. There is a decent selection of margaritas and beers but wine selection isn't great. My wife liked her large margarita. The wine I had was not too good but no worse than at the Mexican restaurant 5 minutes from our Oregon home. My fajitas were good and plentiful. I couldn't finish everything. My wife couldn't finish her pollo especial and liked it.  Unfortunately service was not too good. We waited almost ten minutes for water though we had chips and salsa immediately. There was a busboy but other than delivering chips and salsa I don't know what he does: water delivery and refill and removing dishes are apparently not in the job description. Our waitress was nice and efficient but was challenged by the number of tables. Fortunately she could multitask that is taking multiple orders or delivering drinks to several tables or handling our check between other tasks. However service is important and there were problems which dropped my review stars. We will be back. It is so convenient we return eventually.My husband, two year old son and I decided to have a fun little night away during Labor Day weekend. We used Priceline and this is the place that accepted our bid. Upon arriving we were placed in a room with two queen beds. We went back downstairs and asked the young lady at the front if we could please be moved because we need a king size bed to fit all three of us. She had a bit of a snotty attitude because we used Priceline and we cannot expect to get a king size using Priceline. What???? We have used Priceline numerous times and no one ever treated us as substandard because of it. So, no king for you is what we were told. OK. We made do and pushed the two beds together for a gigantic bed so that worked out. Just did not appreciate being treated like dirt because we didn't pay their top price for the room.

Complaints: 
The wifi ran sooooooo slow, was poor quality, and we had to keep punching in the password for it every few minutes or so. Very annoying. We were not aware of the the $19 resort fee. That is something we never encountered before. We had to pay $19 for a resort fee to use things like the tennis court and bicycles. Hello? It is August in Arizona. No one is using those amenities, yet, we had no choice but to pay for it anyway. The ice machine was so far away from us and was a complete pain in the butt to get to. The crowd was a bit young and quite pretentious. The TV volume was capped off at 36 which in a way, is a great idea, but we could barely hear it ourselves.

Praises:  The room itself was OK. Very old furnishings but it was clean. The most amazing part about the room is how thick the walls are and how quiet it was. We could hear the music from the pool very loudly during the day but at night, not a whisper. You couldn't even hear your neighbor's inconsiderate slamming of the doors because of how insulated everything is. This was probably the quietest hotel room I have ever stayed in! The gentlemen at the front door/valet were always very nice and right on top of opening the door for us everytime. They have a very nice late check out time of 1pm which I have never seen before. This let us linger and take our time which was much appreciated. They only held back $50 on our credit card for incidentals and it was taken off the next day which is very fast!

I would have given three and a half stars for this place if the option was there. We did not eat any food there so I cannot give a rating on that. All in all, we were definitely not disappointed. I just do not feel like this is a four star hotel. And, again, we did not like feeling like we did not deserve 'resort' service because we went through Priceline. We would come back for the nice quiet room and late check out time alone though!I have been to this restaurant many times with friends, family, clients, dates and EVERY time the food and service was SUPER!  Never tasted a bad dish and loved the service.   EXCEPT for list last week.  Took my daughter for her birthday and it was my least favorite.  The Bruchetta was dry and the waiter called me a liar about my response to having a dish before stating "we just added that 3 weeks ago"  I don't know I just never got the right vibe from him and our service took over 2 hours and we didn't have a good time with our waiter.  Before this trip a 5 would be my rating but with this last trip the "honeymoon" feels over.We get our company cars cleaned here and my manager always talks about how nice and convenient they are. So per her suggestion, I took my car in and got the $24.99 wash. The employee at the cash register was nice and helpful and the wash took about 10 minutes. The wash wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst either. I will probably go back just because the location is convenient.As others have noted, this is a very busy place, but for good reason. It's in a fantastic location on Shea Blvd., and the people who work here are incredibly friendly and very hard working, although some of the employees at other nearby Starbucks, such as the one near the Wal-mart by Raintree & 101, are (shockingly) friendlier. It's impossible to get coffee and/or breakfast here in the mornings, though, if you're on your way to work. At 8:30 in the morning they really need to put the most efficient (not necessarily the friendliest) person in front of the cashier counter, and it seems they did quite the opposite. It would also be nice if they could extend the front wall by about 2 feet and put more tables inside. The atmosphere is usually somewhat chaotic, and the music can be just a bit too loud and repetitive, too, but the fact that they even have a lounge chair at which I can park myself with a laptop and chillout for hours on end with free wi-fi I shouldn't complain too much. There aren't any other loungeable coffeeshops very close to this intersection (94th & Shea). UPDATE: Scratch that. Coffee Plantation @ Scottsdale Road and Shea. It's worth the drive.I took my two boys on this adventure and I guess I was expecting more. We went up Bulldog Canyon and it was beautiful, but I was expecting a little more excitement in the hummer (steeper terrain or some thrills) plus some deeper expertise from our guide. We got neither. It was an experience that we will sort of remember, but think it may worth looking around for other options.Beautiful place, but we paid $28 for 2 plain bagels and 2 OJ's.  Before tip.Pricey for what you're getting, and though it's Carefree/N.Scottsdale area, it just doesn't quite justify it.  Food isn't bad, but not great either.  Inauthentic mixture of several asian cuisines here too.  Parking is good though.I got a new 15 SEER air conditioning system installed at my house to replace our 20 year old unit.  This place was recommended by friends.  The price was competitive and they installed it without problems for at least 3 years so far.  I did have some minor complaints about the way they made a mess where they attached the AC to the metal hood up on my roof.  It doesn't change how it functions, but I see it every time I pull up to the house.Like it. Typical desert summer staff, but I thought the service was OK enough. Not 4 or 5 star.
Beds and rooms, pretty good.
Warning!! They smoke on the property. Might jujst be an AZ thing, but ALL Marriott properties in the US are supposed tro be non-smoking. How this one gets away with it, I jave no idea. Just a word of caution.
Love the way it is built in to the hill. Might not be good place for handicapped or elderly. Plenty of stairs and walking. Neither bother me too much.
Breakfast is typical Marriott.
If price is good, book it, you won't be sorry. Good spot for business travelers, as it is close to that area.I visited the Vision Center at this location to have an eye exam.

The staff was a bit disorganized. There are a few front-facing people who handle people who are checking out or buying glasses. I had to interrupt one of them, since there was no indication of what to do to check in for an appointment. That lady was irritated that no one in the back was helping people to their appointments. In the back, there were two assistants (a.k.a. high school students) that helped with appointment paper work and the basic eye tests that come before every eye exam. I had to do one of the tests over, because the assistant didn't tell me that I had to take out my contacts. She was more interested in going out to lunch with her friend. She actually booked out of the place after improperly administering the tests and the other assistant had to help me. The optometrist was irritated that the assistants could not properly administer the tests. 

The facility is definitely what you would expect of a doctor's office set up in a Walmart. It had only basic equipment and was pretty plain, though it seemed at least decently clean. 

The good thing about the process was that it was pretty fast and simple. They didn't have me sitting around for an hour like most medical offices. The tests and visit with the doctor were the same as I've had elsewhere. Unfortunately, the price was the same as any eye exam I've had at about $75 (additional $20 fee if you want your pupils dilated). It would be nice to save more than time considering the staff and facilities are not up to par with typical offices.

Another good thing is that Walmart is partnered with 1800contacts. This makes it easy to send in your prescription and order contacts online. I do recommend buying your contacts from 1800contacts, since they are typically about 50% the price of buying them in person at the optometrist's office.I normally wouldn't even think to review a Walmart store because historically I've DESPISED them!  But, recently, I discovered a Walmart - This Walmart - And have had a change of heart (so to speak).  I find this Walmart to be free from 'Walmartians' (or at least I haven't witnessed any while I've been in there) and the staff is actually helpful and pleasant....That's right, you read that correctly....Helpful and pleasant - They don't appear to DESPISE their jobs and lives as much as I use to despise Walmart as law.  Additionally, I find this store to be quite clean and well stocked with inventory, which is a bonus!  So there you have it.....A Walmart store within the State of Arizona which is acceptable and not a challenge to even think about entering into. 

Happy Shopping!Stopped in here for a couple football Sundays this season, and had a couple different experiences.  This first time was good, our waitress was attentive.  We ordered an appetizer sampler than was more than enough for 4 people (though I might have exceeded my cheese curd quota for some time).  In addition to the free wings in the afternoon this place seemed like a keeper.  The second trip was a little different.  Had to hunt for our waitress just to get a drink, and they arbitrarily chose not to do the free wing promo that day because "they kitchen was busy", even though the place seemed no busier than previous visits.  That left a bad taste with us, but maybe we'll be back to see if that was just a minor hiccup in what was an otherwise decent dive bar.It a Walmart, yelp. Stop asking me to review it. I go here when I need stuff from here but prefer target. It's just a personal preference. 

They offer a lot. I was really happy they had goat milk here but now every time I go they are our. Kind of,frustrating.Had some calamari tempura and a couple sushi rolls. Nothing was bad, but nothing was particularly memorable either. All of the staff was extremely pleasant.Arrowhead is a good average mall. It has everything you would expect from a typical mall and it is clean. The food court is ok, it could be better. 

The only problem that I have with Arrowhead is that it's lacking variety and pizzazz. My boyfriend pointed out that it doesn't have a lot of places for guys besides your typical Foot Locker, Dick's, and Macy's etc... 

If looking for your basics and no frills malls give Arrowhead a try but if  you're wanting more then try Arizona Mills or Scottsdale Mall.3 stars-o.k.  It use to be better.  It has gotten more expensive and the quality of pizza has gone down.  Also noticed on my last visit it isn't as clean or nice as it use to be.  The booth we were in had paint peeling-very unattractive.  I would go again but only with a coupon and would choose my eating area carefully.  Also, sometimes the owners (I think might be workers) kids are there.  They are loud and not well behaved.I'll start off by saying this course is a blast, and it's a good value.  It's shorter than a standard course, but it as some interesting challenges.  The most memorable hole is, I believe, the 8th hole, where you have to hit it up a large stone wall onto the green.

I've played it twice, and it was in pretty good shape both times.

The last time we played, the way the rangers handled the pace was disastrous.  They spaced the groups only about five minutes apart, which was absurd.  At one point, the group behind us was asked to move up on one of the holes, which left them justifiably angry, especially considering the bottleneck was about three groups up.  It's clear they don't know how to handle crowds there, but they can start by allowing more than five minutes between tee times, and address any bottlenecks by rushing the group that is actually playing too slowly.Any place that will give me as many french fries as I can consume is  A-OK with me!

This RR location is conveniently located right across from the Peoria Sports Complex, making it a great spot to grab some food and drinks before seeing my San Diego Padres show off their skills during Spring Training.  

While RR is known for their burgers (and they looked really good!), I chose the Chicken Caesar Wrap.  Maybe this wasn't the best idea.  The first half was very tasty, with a nice balance of chicken, parmesan and caesar dressing all wrapped in a spinach tortilla.  However, the second half was lacking a key ingredient - the chicken!  It was bite after bite of lettuce.  Lettuce, lettuce, lettuce.  I should have ordered a burger.  I consoled myself by continuing to consume fries.  Glorious fries.

The staff is friendly and attentive - our waitress Jazmin took great care of us - fry basket and beer glasses were never empty.  I would have mentioned the lack of chicken in my wrap, but after all those fries, it really didn't matter.  I am sure she would have corrected the issue though, with a smile.

Friendly staff, fries (!) and the proximity to my Padres will convince me to give RR another try before Spring Training ends.  And this time, I will order a burger.This is my fourth time here.  Two of the times were to just play trivia and have some adult liquid libation (ll).  One time was for some appies and ll.  Tonight we stopped in to play trivia and have a bite for dinner.  This isn't the greatest place for playing trivia as there are only two TV's - one at either side of a long bar.  So you need to be sitting at one end or the other of the bar to be able to play.  OK I have to admit that when we play trivia we always sit at the bar if there is room.  I didn't look around at the rest of the restuarant to see if there were other TV's with the game.  

Our previous visits were earlier mid afternoon and I wondered how they stayed in business with few patrons.  Tonight was different.  The place was pretty packed.

It's noisy but not ear-splitting noisy.

The barpeeps were great.  Attentive and friendly. I had a grilled chicken sandwich that came california style and with fries.  Really good sandwich even if a little salty.  Fries were salty too but really tasty.  Couldn't resist chowing down on about a third of them.  I always think I will be able to resist but when they are this good it's just too hard.

I have to go with a very stong three.  Even thought the trivia layout wasn't the best, that isn't what I rate restaurants on.  The service was good, my sandwich was a cut above average, and the house chardonnay was very acceptable.Retirees' nite out?  wow I have never seen such a huge concentration of over 65 group in 1 place!  This place was packed & IT WAS REALLY LOUD IN THERE!

Luckily got a booth in the bar and we did actually get pretty "ok" service.  Food was pretty good.  I was a bit miffed my wine came in a glass as opposed to the regular way of them pouring it in a crafe and gving you that along with you glass, so I got a bit gypped there.  

Was a good option to go to before heading over to the Skye Theatre.If you look, you can find some cool stuff.1st break in the rule of no 3 stars.   I think I have some good feedback.  

Course / Conditions:
The layout is as described, not too tough for the hacker, but the tee boxes and adding yardage ramp the course up.   #9 and #18 are great holes with water caries on each.  18 is one of the toughest for shorter hitters.   I am not long and from the 2nd tees back hit in to 9 on my first pass at the course, but in 3 rounds (on either hole) that was the sole time I went for it.   The back nine from 15 in to 18 were my favorite layouts.

Greens in good shape, fairways pretty nice, just a few chunky spots.

Clubhouse / Staff:
A negative here was that on the first of the 3 rounds, there were just 10 tee boxes set up.  I went to practice some chips and came back 15 minutes prior to my tee time and no spots were available on the range.   They had more blocks and balls, but would not open any up.  Balls were also so beat up, not vice like most ranges.  The tees also hardly had any grass to hit off, they needed to be moved, but they chuckled when I mentioned this.

Staff in Pro Shop were nice.

Pace:
Biggest gripe was this!   On first round for nearly the entire day, had to wait 5 minutes on each tee.   Come on now, 8 minutes for each group will do this on a busy day.   Would have been a 4 star review had this been better.

Slope Rating:
I think a bit high, but perhaps my first round (6000ish yards - 123 slope) of the 3 was an anomaly.   I could not come close the last two rounds.  I played the 2nd set back on 1st round, then the Lilla 6500 ones the 2nd and 3rd rounds.   


Would I go again, yep.   Worth the price, yes, got a deal through Golfnow and it was fair.Giving blood just seems like such an easy way to put some good into the country (UBS ships the blood they collect all over the country!), so I do it every 8 weeks. 

This location is a little difficult to find, as it's in an office park that is totally empty all the time, all the way in the corner. It's very clean and the staff there are very nice (I had a terrible experience at the W Charleston center, where the staff is rude). I have had an experience at this location that was inconvenient, but was chalked up to a new tech not knowing all the donation options.

Here's what to expect:
1. Your blood pressure, temperature and pulse will be taken. Your pulse must be under 100 bpm (hot weather increases pulse). If any of these are too high, you can't donate that day.
2. Your iron level will be tested with a prick on your finger. If your iron is too low, you can't donate.
3. There are 3 options for donation: whole blood, plasma and double red cell. Anyone can donate whole blood, although it makes many people woozy. Plasma can be donated by anyone who has never been pregnant. Double red cell requires you to be at least 5'5" and 150+ pounds. The last two options are the easiest on your body.
4. Your arms will be checked for lesions. If you have anything that could be construed as a needle mark, they will reject you. 
5. You'll be asked some semi-uncomfortable questions about sex, but they're simply part of the screening process. 
6. They'll do their best to make you comfy with blankets, heating pads, ice, refreshments, etc. 
7. Whole blood takes about 20 minutes. Plasma takes about 30 minutes. Double red takes about 2 hours. (These times are for actual donation only. The interview, set-up and post-donation resting period/snack fest take more time)
8. Every time you go, regardless of whether you're able to donate or not, you'll receive a "prize", generally tickets to something (a 51s game, this time!).

All in all, giving blood is the least I can do and the people here make it as easy and painless as possible!There are 2200+ Home Depot locations worldwide and this location in Henderson is one of their larger square footage locations. You'll find most of the same SKU's or inventory on the shelves here as you will at a Home Depot across the valley so product wise it's pretty well established on what you're going to find here. 

The Henderson location doesn't have a tool rental location. Service can range from OMG they went over the top to help me find  that replacement patio door handle I needed to feeling like I'm standing on the top of Mt. Charleston yelling HELLO and there's nobody around to hear me. This is a location where they seem to put some emphasis on keeping the shelves stocked which is nice. But if you want some help with a project that involves customization, or you want someone that can think outside of the box to help you track down a part that might work for what you have in mind or recommend the right polyurethane sealer you need for an art project or the next Burning Man art piece you'll find you are in a big box store and the staff struggles to think outside that box. 

More often than not I walk in here and get some of the stuff I need but I usually end up at Lowes 1/2 mile South to buy everything I need for the wide ranging projects I'm always working on. 

3 Stars. (If I need contractor grade items....Home Depot is still my first choice).I am updating my previous review to an A-OK based upon the following: Barleys Brewfest, staying in business while neighbors closed and their beer remains decent.  The signature brew is Red Rock Oktoberfest Lager.I want to first say that this review is 5 stars for the sales team.  I purchased 2 vehicles from Robert Anderson within a year. He is a great salesman and will do what he can to make a deal. He BS's little and is to the point with dealing, which is what I like. 

Financing is ONE star. I have awesome credit and did not have a hard time at all getting financing. The financing person was extremely rude and almost ruined the deal. He was so obnoxious and insulted my family ( he was Hispanic and my family is Asian, he made some remarks about how Asian people are cheap and stingy, because I did not want to buy an extended warranty). Just because of the treatment I got I have now traded in both of my vehicles ( a Rav4 and 4runner) and purchased a $101000 between 2 new vehicles at another brand in the valley auto mall.

Service is ONE star. I love Toyota Vehicles, and have had very few problems, infact I only had one problem which I consider a warranty problem. The service dept wanted money upfront for a warranty repair and told me to submit it to Toyota corporate, which they (Corp) agreed it was a warranty repair and mailed a check, but why did I have to go submit a claim when that it  service job. 

Also just to get an oil change done is an all day affair. Consider this as you will waste a whole day off.

Toyota is a great product, and the sales team here is nice and fair. Before you buy if this is the dealer you will be financing and servicing from, please be prepared to be miss treated after the purchase.We always end up at Chili's when we can't think of anywhere else to go.  It's just that kind of place.  This location is just okay.  Sometimes the service is decent, other times it's slow.  

For a while, Chili's had veggie tacos.  Man, I loved those things.  Now they are gone, and I am sad.  

Still, I like their spicy sausage soup (whatever its real name is) and their black beans.  I'm sure we'll be back the next time we can't think of anything else to eat.This is our week day hang out. Coffee is good and I know most of the people who hang out there. Only down fall is that the owner forgets to pay the power bill occasionally and I have witnessed at least three power turn offs.Good for a quick lunch.

I have come to know this particular location as "the good Arby's".  It's the only one in the valley that is consistently decent.  The place is mostly clean, the food is okay for what it is, and the staff are nice.This is definitely the go-to pho spot post a crazy Vegas night.

The soup is A-OK - but due to the limited selection, I will definitely recommend this place + Lee's coffee is right next door.

Please note that they do not have tripe!good place to go out for late dinner.  Open till 3:00 AM.  Price little bit expensive than what I usually pay for Com thit nuong.I never expected to find such a treasure in an odd part of town, but I found another entryway into Japan on Charleston Blvd and Rancho here in Las Vegas. What was amazing to me was this small restaurant is nestled between a poker lounge and a dental office, and it's called Nozomi. As my manager explained when telling me about this little place, it's one of those eateries you wouldn't normally step in to because of the location and fear of food poisoning. However, I am estatic to say that profile of this place is dead wrong.

They have the menu posted on their entrance, which is typical of any Japanese restaurant where I come from, and their decor is so simple and very Japan that I was right at home when I walked in. The seating arrangement is casual; sit where you like, whether it be the small sushi counter in the corner or one of the many tables, it's up to you. The menus are under the glass on the tables, so you can order from it as you go during the evening. I have to say that I was happy to see a steak dish on the Japanese menu, and different ways to order tempura and sushi.

The one thing that is off putting to me in the states is this constant use of avocado in every sushi rull imaginable. When ordering the tempura roll (finally, a place that has a shrimp tempura roll!), there were chunks of avocado in it. I was at first apprehensive to taste it, but it turned out to be quite good. Their yellowtail and tuna are just as great, and served up Japanese style. The one test I have for any Japanese restaurant is their tempura--and they surpassed my test.

Their tempura is one of the best in Las Vegas, and as good as the Genji Japanese restaurant in the Hilton on Guam. The cuisine from Guam is impeccable, including Japanese food, and the tempura was authentic and fried up by old Japanese men straight from Japan. When trying to find good tempura in Vegas, I look for the signs of a good Japanese place--Japanese owners, and Japanese people eating in that restaurant. I found both here.

We did wait long for the tempura, but when it was received we realized that they were waiting for the oil to heat up to get it perfect. We ordered tempura three times that evening, and were quite satisfied. I have to say that the batter is light and crispy, no hints of grease when delivered, and displayed on a square plate with the oil paper underneath and great tempura sauce on the side. It was light, crispy, and satisfying.

Overall, this restaurant is worth the trip to East Charleston Blvd. Please give it a try--it's worth a shot!This is a classic Hotel from the 70's. I would recommend getting a Tower room. While the courtyard rooms serve the purpose, i think you'd be plesantly surprised at the difference of a tower room. The pool is secluded in the back of the property and is open LATE. I recommend the Irish pub hands down!!! The buffet is cheaper than most and serves to be a good meal. It can be very very crowded at dinner time,The Skinny: great when you get here around 10:20 am when stuff is fresh from the oven... otherwise you might have a lot less things to choose from (3.75), service: good - if you don't see something, ask the ladies and they'll find it for you in the back (3), value: pricey but will satisfy your Asian bakery fix (3)

The first couple of times I came here, I wasn't really impressed. The counters were pretty bare in the afternoon and I walked out empty handed.

Then, for whatever reason, we stopped by this place at 10:20 am. I was shocked. They had Portuguese Egg Tarts (a Macau specialty - egg tarts with a golden brown topping from the extra sugar), Curry beef puffs, butter pan loaves, Taiwanese type sammys, rice dumplings. It was like a completely different store.

The Portuguese Egg Tarts are okay. I find the filling to be nice, but there are problems with the pastry. Not quite the shortbread crust, it's kind of a hybrid of between the flaky and cookie crust.

The curry beef puff is good. The puff pastry is flaky and light while the curried beef is flavourful. The bbq pork puff pastry was ok due to the lackluster bbq pork filling.

If baked buns are your thing, there is a caveat. I would say that the bun is a little on the drier side - okay when fresh but isn't that good the next day. For the buns without filling (ie, pineapple buns), you might find yourself a little disappointed. That being said, if you are a filling kind of person, you'll love this bakery because of the copious amounts of filling in their red bean and lotus paste buns. 

The steamed buns are great and hold up better (I've refrigerated them and resteamed them the next day and it's good.). Fav are the red bean steamed bun - lots of filling, nice lighter texture than what you normally see.

I really love their butter pan loaf (I'm not talking about the butter pan buns... see the pic here because I have no idea what they really call it in English: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q ). I got addicted to this brioche-like bread in Hong Kong from their famous Maxim's bakery. Although Diamond's cannot compare to Maxim's, it still is pretty good. Buttery and lighter than their regular bread, it iswonderful toasted with a little butter/jam.

With some great things items, this is my "go to" place when I've a hankering for some Chinese bakery if I can get here when the bread comes out of the oven (10:20am).good chinese BBQ after a week of vegas buffets haha we ordered the three plate bbq, so it had roast pork, soy sauce chicken and roast duck. it wasnt the best ever, but it his the spot. the vegetable were fresh and tasty as well as the fried rice we ordered. :DThe Hard Hat lounge is a typical, traditional bar. It still has a kitchen-but since the smoking law came into affect a few years ago, the oven is idle. On the border of a sketchy neighborhood (the once fantastic Naked City), I had never had an issue visiting this bar. At nights you have to get buzzed in, but once you are in the mood is sedate and comfortable. A pool table exists in case you need more exercise than lifting your beer or your jack and coke! BUT--- the real star here is the mural by Frank "Maverick" Bowers from 1963.  The mural evokes more a feeling of 1956, than 63, but maybe The Maverick was stuck in his painting ways.  The legend has it that he painted the mural to pay off a bar tab (google his name and you may find more mentions of his doing this in other areas like Los Angeles). An awesome mural and one the bar is proud of!1. Very friendly staff, helpful, straightforward. They gave us a free quote and no pressure to have EVERYTHING fixed. 
2. Price seemed fair, work was done pretty fast
3. Downsides : I know it is aesthetic but they didn't even vacuum out my car, no car wash, nothing. After spending over a thousand dollars at a car shop I couldn't believe they didn't make it look nice giving it back to me. Even cheap-o oil change places vacuum out your car :(
4. I have had TWO problems that weren't there before within 5 days of getting my car back. Coincidence? Maybe. Irritating? Very. My windshield washer fluid *magically* doesn't spray out now, and the battery was found to be "weak"When I first moved to Las Vegas, my newfound friends took me here for some boba. I never knew such a drink or dessert existed until I was introduced by them and I'm grateful they did because I'm able to share my favorites with yelp* and anyone who's ever been will agree with me 100%!

Boba is "slimy, yet satisfying" -- (c) Timon, Disney's Lion King.

First off, I'll warn you that parking is the biggest problem. When a place gets real popular, parking is always a battle! Parking tip: Right next to Tea Station, behind the east side wall, is Harbor Palace (stay tunes for a review!), is some parking and you can walk right on over to Tea Station no problem! Once you've won the battle of parking, you'll walk in and often times, especially after 8pm, the tables are taken and crowded-- exactly what happens when I wear skinny jeans: TIGHT! They offer a discount of 30% off when you take your drinks to go (good business move and idea!) so take advantage of it if you don't have a party to entertain. Take your drinks and take a stroll on the strip that isn't too far away from Tea Station. If you decide to ignore the 30% discount and stay, grab a deck of cards to entertain yourself while the Asian "baristas" throw your drink together.

I came here a few times and a few bad experiences with the service. The waiter tends to get your order wrong if you don't explain clearly what you want or point to the menu.  Should I fail this place in my book if I've grown numb to the bad service I get here sometimes? I'm not the only who's said the same thing, but then again the drinks are the best boba drinks I've tasted here in Las Vegas. Sigh... What a love/hate relationship! What am I talking about again?! Oh yes, Tea Station! Here's a list of my favorite drinks and dishes served! Stick with this list (that will keep growing) and you can't go wrong! Try:

*fried taro balls
*hot taro milk tea
*hot honey black tea
*honeydew ice with rainbow jelly
*pork chops and rice!

Note: Taro is like the potato of the tropics. It has a starchy consistency with a different distinct flavor. Trust me! You'll like it.

Enjoy!Not a big fans of buffets but this one was okay. The food didn't all taste microwaved like other buffets do. They could use a bigger selection of food. The service was decent. One star for the food being okay, one star for the service, and one star because the last buffet we had was atrocious, so this place seemed worlds better.This place has nothing on Nielsons Frozen Custard! We heard incredible things about Luv-It and went to check it out, the custard wasn't bad and ill admit was very creamy, but their selections were disappointing and I was blown away that people could even say it was comparable to Nielsons. Not bad, but we have definitely had better!Since I made the moved to Vegas, everyone seemed to rave about this place. I say, it's okay. I've had the banana nut custard - western style, as well as, malt cream and peanut butter custard. The way people talked about this place, I was waiting for it to be heaven in my mouth...not so much. It's okay. If you like frozen custard, this place is worth a try. It has a very nice view of the stratosphere but the location is very sketchy. There's a lot of homeless people around asking for money. Just say no. I know of someone who tried to be nice and give one of these guys money...we watched him walk into the liquor store shortly after.Really didn't think it was anthing special, but the food was good and it was served fast. Not much more to say. If I was in the mood for Thai I would go back unless I found a better place on Yelp.Get ready to wait! This place is busy and you will be waiting for a while until you see the doctor. Then you will sit in the exam room and wait some more.

I suggest you make your appointment first thing in the morning or you can forget about finding a parking spot. Some visits I could not even find a place to park, so I just left. Other than the fact that it is difficult to find a parking spot and you have to wait forever, the staff has always been nice and so have the doctors.

I had to go hear because of an injury I sustained to my knee. The doctor I went to see was Dr. Kim. I needed to get surgery to repair my knee so Dr. Kim performed my knee surgery. I guess he did a good job because my knee feels better. My knee feels better than before my injury but it will never be the same. I still can't walk up or down stairs with out pain. Dr. Kim said he did everything he could do. I think I am going to go see another surgeon and get a second opinion. I feel like they just want to get you in and out there so they can get make money and move on to the next patient. Las Vegas is just a bad place to get any type of medical attention.I really wanted to like this place. I have heard good things about it and it is one of the only "nice" restaurants in the Northwest but overall I was struggling to really "like it". I ultimately gave it a three based upon the food as that is what I primarily consider, I would provide it a four based on decor and ambiance.

First off, I really like the wine shop and they had some good wines at decent prices. Also, the $10 corkage fee is attractive and I like that you can buy a wine right there. We sat out on the patio, this too I liked. There was live music, a saxophonist, a little loud but still nice. It was a small little alcove next to the water which provided an intimate feel. The service was prompt and pleasant as well. 

We had the steak tar-tare appetizer, this was tasty. Also, I had the French Onion soup. I love French Onion soup and this was a nice surprise, probably my favorite part of the meal, light sherry undertone and very rich. I ordered the Risotto with truffles. Risotto was too al dente for my taste and was under-seasoned. The risotto was $18. I shared this entry with my husband who ordered the Lobster Pot Pie. The pot pie was also disappointing; they would have been well served to have called it Lobster stew. There was a good amount of lobster in the "pie", but there should be especially in light of the hefty $40 price tag. But the flavor was lacking and it was not rich and creamy but more soupy. We had the Lobster Pot Pie at Michael Mina in SF and it was phenomenal for about the same price or possibly even less. And don't get me wrong I have no qualms with spending money on a great meal, I will gladly do so, but I still like to review each meal on it's own and by comparison with other restaurants at similar price points. 

Our other dinner companion had the duck breast. I tried a piece of his and it was very moist and had a good flavor. Overall, nice decor and food was good, but not good enough for me to come running back here when there are so many other places in LV to try and not quite sure why they made it into the 50 essential restaurant book.This casino is super smokey! I had some difficulty breathing. I played a little bit of MegaBucks, hoping to win my fortune but it didn't happen. I did do pretty well and was able to play for quite a while on my $21.I was pleasantly surprised at how satisfied I was staying at Hooters.  At first I was embarrassed to tell anyone I was staying at this ridiculous place -- but for the money, it's hard to beat.  I got a deal through Expedia: 3 nights and flight from San Francisco for under $300.  I expected the place to be obnoxious, ultra sexist, run-down and sleazy -- but it was nothing less than a standard, decent, clean, spacious room with everything you'd expect in a moderately priced hotel.  No strange hairs, no used condoms, no unusual wear.  It even had a safe in the room, which I was a bit surprised to see.  I never went to the pool and I never used room service, so I can't vouch for those.  I mean really -- I wasn't there to enjoy chicken wings and chicks in orange '70s-influenced get-ups.  I was there for an affordable, comfortable, convenient place to recharge between gambling at the REAL hotel-casinos.  And that's exactly what I got.  I highly recommend it.Coming to Vegas for a convention and reserved at the Hooter's Hotel. Checking in was no problem; however, were a bunch of unsavory characters lurking around and following me. When I get to my room, turns out the balcony door had no lock or bar on it, so I'm afraid to get a good nights sleep. Eventually after contacting the front desk, the maintenance man to fix it with a screw driver. There was a nice pool area with a water fall which I enjoyed. It's located at the south end of the strip across the street from the MGM Grand hotel. If you are planning to catch the Monorail inside of the MGM Grand you will have to cross over the busy street to do so. I rate this a 3 overall.I took my 2002 Audi A4 in to get both headlight bulbs replaced.  They took me right away and had the bulbs in stock.  They were very straight forward about the amount of time it would take (~45 minutes) and the price estimate ($125).  I went ahead with the repair because I had no headlights but it seemed pretty steep for just replacing the bulbs.  I haven't had it done at the dealership before so I have no comparison.  

Overall they were very straight-forward and friendly.  The repair itself is fine.I love the signs on the walls.  Great specials.  Bartenders are hit or miss, some seem quite confused.   I'm not a huge fan of the billion TVs, but hey it's a sports bar.My first experience at both a Wisconsin supper club and a fish fry.  It is tasty, but man - may as well drink a little drano or punch yourself in the lower intestine a few times.  The amount of grease in the food has roughly the same effect.  

I agree with Kraft - the battered cod is the highlight of the dining experience.  That and seeing what all those Wisconsin kids grew up with...I had not been here in quite awhile,  but i saw the happy hour deals and my wife and I decided to give it a try.  On the good side,  service was great,  the calamari appetizer was excellent and we enjoyed the discounted wine.  On the minus side,  my wife ordered her steak medium rare and emphasized the rare part and still received a mefium to medium well steak.  Very disappointing for a steak place.   I took a chance and had the thai pizza.  It had some nice flavors but was bone dry.  Just some tangy sauce would have made it.  So, disappointing for us.  I truly expected better.No free chips and salsa? You cannot brand yourself as Tex-Mex without this. It's a rite of passage. Queso? That's not queso. Don't order it. It's melted cheese on chips. No frozen margaritas? What nonsense is that? At least it's tasty. Those three things make this restaurant a no-go for Tex-Mex authenticity.

Those little mishaps aside, El Dorado has some charm. As far as Tex-Mex (food) in Madison goes, this place is pretty solid. I wouldn't say it's great, but I understand the appeal. The food is tasty, but as a native Texan, I crave chips and salsa, queso, and frozen margaritas. Step your game up, El Dorado.

As for the food, I had the spinach mushroom enchiladas, and they were delicious. The ingredients are fresh and well-cooked, and the presentation is spot-on. The margaritas were also tasty, but too many things threw me off about the restaurant for it to be one of my favorites in Madison.

Overall, I enjoyed the food, but it wasn't the experience I was hoping for. If they had branded themselves as a modern Mexican joint, I think I would have been pleasantly surprised, but by labeling themselves as Tex-Mex, they set themselves up for failure in my eyes (and mouth).


I heard the brunch is great, but I'm not too motivated to try it out.I don't see what the big deal is about this place. I've had brunch there a few times and it was good but not 5 Stars good. The location is great for people that live downtown because there are not a lot of brunch options. The staff is friendly, but it's Madison so the staff is friendly at most places. The prices are good and reasonable. The food is good too, but it's not amazingly good. My girlfriend is crazy about the hash browns. I find them way too greasy. They leave this orangish colored grease streak on your plate that I was never a fan of. Overall, it's a good spot for brunch, but if you are expecting to be blown away, don't.  I would take Mickey's Dairy Bar over Marigold any day of the week...accept Monday because that day Mickey's is closed!Multiple trips have taught me that this place is consistent and filling, but it shouldn't blow one's mind. Chicken: tasty; staff: friendly; servings: plentiful.Have been here a couple of times in the 4.5 years that I have been in Madison. The first time I was here was definitely not planned. My roommate and I were heading to Saigon noodles, but they were super busy one evening (before they renovated and expanded the area), hence we stopped by Sai Bai Thong. I have had the pineapple dried rice, which was a pretty nice and interesting dish. The fried rice was contained in the shell of the pineapple instead of on a plate. The natural pineapple flavors infused into the rice, adding a truly refreshing taste to it. I am not sure if this dish is still being served, that was one of their specials some time back. 

Today I dined in again and had the duck curry. Serving is decent and our waitress was good. But I find that the curry is a tad too salty for my taste. Given the price range and the type of food this is not one of my regular go-to places, but once in a (long) while, if I am looking and looking for a place different to eat, I would give it a go.Really good, greasy pizza.  However, in a town full of truly great pizza (Glass Nickel, Ian's, and Roman Candle), Falbo Bros is just a late night stop.  It is what it is.Yummy Chips and Salsa! If your up for something new try a MALIBU MELON MARGARITA, only made at Pedro's, It's delicious!Ahhh... The beds here are so comfy. I got a really, really good night sleep.

The ambiance of the lobby is nice but... the pool is lacking :(  only 3ft deep across the entire length??? and there's a charge for wi-fi in your room. Sigh... if it wasn't for the nice atomsphere and ultra-good beds, they'd get 2 stars from me.

And I forgot to put the 'do not disturb' sign on the door so house keeping came in during the morning. No problem, but they turned on the light and forgot to turn it off =(  

Overall, next time I'm in Phoenix, I'll try a different place.Low key establishment.  Its consistent so you usually know what you're in for.  Bar tenders are pretty cool - its the same hard working and nice young guys every time I go there (weekends).Food is fresh, fast and inexpensive....very convenient to city hall which is where I work.  But right in the middle of eating, the worker took out a wet mop with PINE SOL and mopped the floor.  I almost had to leave the fumes were so strong but I notice many people covering their noses and some leaving....not the smartest thing I've seen in a restaurant in the middle of their busiest time of day.I have been to The Dodge twice, once to see Blondie and The New Cars, and once to see Kathy Griffin.  It's a nice venue, with a well organized seating plan.  From the outside it looks like it might have arena style seating inside, but it indeed is a theater with a balcony, floor and mezzanine called the club level.

The decor is pleasant and access in and out is a breeze.  The sound quality is top notch, but please make them seats just a bit bigger, not everyone is built like Zac Effron.  Some of us (actually most of us) regular folks need just a little bit more room.  I felt like I was flying in coach class for christ's sakes.

Oh, and to those bitches that talked throughout Kathy's entire performance.  You're just lucky that the girl next to me called you out.  I was ready to go get the usher to give you the boot.  I'm just sayin'.From the outside this downtown-ish restaurant doesn't look like much. Just a large white block. It seems like it should be a taqueria or at least small on the inside... but don't let the looks fool you! it's big on the inside... well - at least bigger than I thought it'd be! 

I grabbed breakfast here and had the original breakfast burrito... this bitch comes with scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon, sausage, ham and cheese. I asked for it without the ham because three meats would've been gluttonous! :P 

I grabbed some mountain dew for the caffine I needed to get through this day, and good mercy! When I saw this huge monstrosity - I wished I asked for it without the sausage too! but I managed! Good and freshly cooked, but when I was ordering I saw the cooks cook up large orders of hashbrowns and there weren't that many people there. Soooo they pre-cook some of their stuff with. I think I was fortunate to have been there early... but if you're going to come later in the morning - I unno... things might not be that fresh. I loved my burrito but it was a LOT of food! I think I'll just stick to my bacon and egg burrito from now on. 

I can't wait to try their burgers!Great price, fast service, chips and salsa are awesome. 

FOOD
You can eat as little as you want or as much as you want and still not break the bank. If you're not really hungry you can get something simple like soup or plain tortillas wth beans. If you're starving order a Mexi-pizza.

Each stereotypical mexican entree comes heaping with beans, rice and lettuce- so you will have a plateful of food. 

SERVICE
Chips, drinks, and salsa arrive at the table almost before you do. Drinks are always promptly refilled. They never complain if they have to split a check. 

OTHER
The only reason they don't get 4 stars is because they aren't high quality Mexican food- more like a step up from fast food. The tables and chairs are also very tightly packed into the establishment.I was on a solo trip to Arizona and I wanted to make sure i stopped to try local food ...or actually real Native American Food... The Fry Bread House was my first spot I went to, to try the culture out!...  The food has some SPICE to it for sure!! What i Had was SPICY but it was good...The bread is made to order and tasty.. Im not sure what I would recommend there because I have not tried many of the items...but the flatbread is pretty good :)This is one of those "they know your name and drink" kind of bars. I'm a newbie, so I felt like the friend of a friend at some dinner party. 

The drink selection is decent. The mixed drinks I found to be a little high priced. $8.50 for a shitty martini? I think not!

They have a deal from 11am-3pm of .99 cents hamburgers, but apparently the catch is you have to buy a drink in order to get the burger deal. Without a drink the burgers are $4. I think that's a rip off. The burgers are decent, but not worth $4 or having to spend money on a drink just to get the burger for a buck.

The jukebox is decent. A good mix of everything from Depeche Mode to Springsteen, lame top 40 and some pseudo country. I didn't dare play a DM song as this crowd looked like they would have lynched a Euro pop loving girl.

They need to add more tables and chairs and dump some of the bar games.

I'd give the place another shot as it's walking distance from my house, but you can get a better deal on drinks and food elsewhere.Ahhh... Christown. How I have always loved thee.. This used to be my personal house when I was a youth. I always loved coming here, whether it was for practice, which was usually 2-3 times a week, or for league/tournaments... Let me go over the alley with you and its pro's and con's:

~What to do?~
Bowling...Lots of bowling...because its a bowling alley ;-) , and is perfect for family outing, school trips, or a party. There is an arcade here as well as pool tables. The tables are inside the bar area, to the right as soon as you walk in. The bar is quiet, its sports-centered and is nice for a guys night out to watch the game and bowl a couple. 

~The Good~
This is the largest bowling house in central Phoenix people. Its held the PBA US Open here before, so it is a location with a good reputation. The manager who runs the center does an great job training the staff, who do a stellar job whenever you need help. The leagues here are large and are fun to experience if you are looking for a Central Phoenix alley with a large league. Once again, its so much bigger than most alleys, so if you need to come by to practice or bowl with friends sometime, it will be difficult to not grab a lane unless there is a league going on.

~The Bad~
However, since it is so big, a lot of the time it does go quiet here, which can be a bit discerning if you like a loud bowling atmosphere. Please note that there is no pro-shop here. That's a bummer, since this is a huge house, you'd expect them to have a bowling shop after all these years and its location. The closest one is Bowling Dynamics up the road on Bethany Home, just across the I-17. Drinks and food are over-the-top expensive, like most bowling alleys, but AMF seems to always goes overboard in my eyes. I do not consider using an arcade at a bowling center a lot, but the one here is very small. Most Brunswick center's have a better overall selection making it a bit more kid friendly. Here, its mainly about taking the family bowling.

~Extras/Rating~
Nothing really else to note here, I covered what you need to know. I base the rating off of the fact I have bowled at every single lane here in Phoenix, I know each one by heart. They do not have a pro shop, which automatically loses a star. Then its the fact that it is your average lane run by AMF. I prefer Brunswick over AMF, they take care of their lanes much better compared to AMF and also have better deals for the most part. I would suggest you try them first. Message me if you want more information or if you would like a suggestion for a good bowling lane to go to.A great old time mexican place!  The food is good and the atmosphere is what you expect for a traditional slightly run down restaurant.  The service is always great and the food is also wonderful.  It is also laid back and good environment for kids.  The parking is sometimes full and the neighborhood not so great, so try to find a space in the small area.So, this place has one vegetarian entree... and I am not completely certain that it was 100% vegetarian. My dining companions seemed to enjoy their food, but I don't think I will be going back.I agree, awesome things can be found here, but it's pretty hit or miss, as is the case with lots thrift/secondhand stores. I do see that their random kitchen type items and sandals/shoes have consistently better prices than Goodwill, as do their kids' books. Not really loving the little kids clothes here, but women's selection was decent. Maternity was awful.Prob better to keep some things a mystery in your life.

Nevermind "WHY", -- whether it's trouble in romantic paradise and it beats the doghouse, or if it is more illicit things that are your forte -- but every once in a while, a person may find themselves in need of a roof over their head that is not their usual abode, or a seat under their butt that is not their usual comode.

When you would simply be throwing money away to pay for a bunch of amenities you will only sleep (or ?) right through, a cheap ass motel fits the bill way more appropriately than a posh resort.

Bell Hotel is a fine and adequate cheap ass motel.  Tidy and clean enough, properly stocked and seemingly well-maintained, considering this place has to have been there a little while longer than the 25 years I've known it to be there.

Just because you're in NoPho, though, doesn't mean you're off the hook watching your back vs. undesireables.  I mean, there is a Waffle House right around the corner, so, you know ...


Incidentally, they seem to have dropped their affiliation with the Best Western chain, as they no longer use the BW logo as part of their signage.  .I'm not one of the people who think that they are better than McDonald's. I actually like the taste of the dollar menu items, so life is cheap for me. This location is the closest to our house, so it's the one that we frequent the most. They're one of the few locations to have four piece chicken nuggets for $1 for the kids, so that's a plus. The McCafe, while obviously not specific to this location, is a cool concept. The drinks are pretty good, and about half the price of a Starbucks. The thing that this location is in dire need of, though, is an update/remodel. The inside decor and the seating areas have a worn-out look to them. It seems that every other McDonald's that I've been to recently has been refurbished. They all have the cafe look to them now and some have really fancy play structures. Other than that, the staff is usually very nice and helpful, and we rarely have any mistakes with our order. The extensive dollar menu offerings and helpful staff balance out the dated decor to leave it with three stars for me.We came here for dinner tonight and I must say as long time Anzio's fans we were a little disappointed with our dinner. It started off great, our waitress even brought out some watermelon for our boys to eat while we were waiting on the food. The 1st thing they brought out was the pizza, which we ordered thin crust because we like it crunchy. Well, it wasn't at all, it was soft, greasy pizza. Then my boyfriends spaghetti came, the meat sauce was a little sweet & the meatballs had way to much bread filler & no flavor. Some things are better homemade I guess. I ordered some chicken wings which they brought out & gave to the wrong table so I had to wait for them to make more which wasn't that big of a deal because it gave me time to get everyone else situated. The garlic bread was stale & over buttered and it almost tasted like they used old butter. Really upsetting, hopefully just a fluke.....I have been to Santisi's serveral times and have never had a bad experience.  With that said; I have never had the time of my life either.  

The food is good and the service is adequate.  I usually just open a tab at the bar as it seems to be a bit quicker to get drinks that way rather then wait on a waitress.

It can get a bit crowded, and the bar side, with the pool tables and dart boards, should probably be redesigned to make better use of the space.  It can be a little awkward manuevering around the place.  

With all things considered; it's a pretty cool spot to hang.Went there and got there Valentine's special, it was a lot of food and a decent price. The food was good except I ordered my steak RARE and got medium. This is a steak house and they should be able to cook steaks to order. It wasn't even medium rare. The service was pretty good though. I'll go back if there's a good special but I'll make sure I order my steak fresh out of the package and then maybe I'll get it rare.We were pleased that we arrived before the big crowd and got shown to a table right away. We had driven by hundreds of times and we always wanted to at least try it once. 

Service was fast and the staff was friendly. I had a delicious smoothie. One of the best I've had so far! My hubby ordered the blueberry pancakes and I got the Cinnamon French Challah bread. I thought everything was pretty good but when we got the bill I was amazed how expensive the meal was! The food was good but not THAT good. I understand they use fresh ingredients and everything but it still seemed a bit overpriced.Damn you Big Mac! Something about that magical combination of two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun that occasionally calls me into a McDonalds. Big Mac fans should know that Culinary Dropout (Scotttsdale, AZ) has a gourmet version of a Big Mac that will blow your freaking mind! FYI - They just tore down the old location here and built a new ultra-modern one with a double drive-thru and laptop workstations.This is basically a happy hour bar, and quite a good one. Cheerful; service & reasonable prices, with an open air atmosphere. Mexican style food - we had nachos & a fish taco & both were just fine. Pacifico bottles were $2 each. Not bad.ekkk, umm maybe i was old town the wrong day. Service sucked but the place was big, maybe ill be back for someones birthday if they have a bar crawl here but by choice im not sure ill be back had to wait 30 mins to get a drink lol!OK this place is good during the week and early on the weekends
Late on weekends it kinda really sucks.
too many, too little space.Stick to the pizza.  The salads tend to be under-dressed and boring (some quality extra virgin olive oil on the pre-packaged mixed greens would jazz things up).   Stay away from the beef skewers, they are over-priced and over-cooked to the point of being charred to a crisp.  My brother and I ended up getting what looked like skewered charcoal for our meal.The Sugar Bowl is more appealing on the outside along with history of the parlor than it truly is.  With its vibrant, inner-child eliciting curb appeal, you have this strange desire to know what's going on inside and to satisfy your sweet tooth.  

My fiance and I have been here twice, and both times were just ok.  It's pretty cool to know that the Sugar Bowl has been around in SCO for over 50 years, as this is a pretty young city, but the vibe hasn't changed much since the 50s and it could use a little updating.  Don't get me wrong, I love a good charm/notalgia to a restaurant, but something about the SB has a weird, almost grimy vibe.  They do serve 'real food' outside of sweets, but I've only had their ice cream combos.  They are pretty generous in their portions, but you have to be careful as to what you order.  The first time we went, I got some crazy sundae, and I was total regretsy.  My fiance got a malt, and I wished I had ordered one.  Our second visit, I ordered a vanilla malt, and my fiance ordered the Top Hat Sundae.  He wished he has ordered the malt, ha.  We did see other sundaes that looked way better than the two we tried, but it's hard to try a third sundae when the first two were just ok.  And how do you screw up a sundae?  By serving an old cream puff (the Top Hat), that is so dry you don't want to finish the fudgy ice cream.  

There isn't anything majorly wrong with the Sugar Bowl, but there isn't much of a wow factor either.  Cool place to stop if you're walking around Old Town and need a break for something sweet.  It's a once a year type place for me at best.I think you could pretty easily compare this restaurant to an IHOP/Village Inn type establishment. It was similarly priced but the food was definitely better than your typical (cheaper) breakfast joint. We were seated right away but there seemed to be a pretty consistent wait in the small dining room. Our table was in a pretty cramped area which I normally don't mind but few people would ever want to sit that close to my typical frazzled Sunday morning self. 

Our food was average. I had a pecan waffle and OJ, the hubby had a short stack of yeast pancakes, home-style potatoes and OJ. It was all OK, our service was good and the check with tip totaled $26 (cash ONLY.) A good alternative to typical breakfast chains but overall nothing that made me swoon over my plate.Seville offers quick turnaround times (in by 9 out by 5, which is pretty impressive), and their prices are good, especially on suits ($5 total for pants and jacket). 

I've had multiple shirts, suits and ties cleaned here, and each time I pick my stuff up, I have mixed results. I dropped a couple of wrinkly ties off, and when I picked them up, they were better, but still wrinkly. The shirts I've dropped off come back with inconsistent levels of starch, and on one shirt, the collar was curled up at the ends...Not a fan of that.

The suits I had cleaned there were done well. Cleaned, pressed and ready for action. I'd definitely return to Seville to get my suits cleaned, or if I was in a pinch and was close by.I'm at an impasse here. The service was jumpy in terms of friendliness. The food was good enough and I suppose it wasn't too much (say 10-17 dollars a plate), but it certainly wouldn't be my first choice.I stopped in at Zipps after going to the dissapointing Wharehouse sale in Scottsdale this weekend. My experience here really rounded out the morning.

There was no place to sit except one tiny table in front of a big screen TV. I bellied up and tried to order fast. There was a crowd of jocks that thought screaming at oddly placed TV's would help their teams to win. I kept trying not to look their way, but I was sitting right in front of the TV so that was a bit difficult. The waitresses that couldn't hear me order so it took about 4 attempts. Once she did hear me she must have forgot I odered in the first place because 2 glasses of tea later I had to hunt her down to order again. Maybe she got brain damage from being around screaming goons all day.. Who knows. The atmosphere was bad, the service was bead... But still 3 stars because they have the BEST wings I've tastes in a long, long time. Next time though, I'll order them to go.PACKED on Friday nights!

Decent drinks; the well 'rita was pretty good.

Our initial intent was to sing karaoke, but we had a large group and there just wasn't room.  So we enjoyed the downstairs open-air room.Took my parents to Bandera last night and it seems to have lost a little of it's edge since the last time. Quickie review... Our 15 minute wait time for a table turned into 45. While not completely their fault they should be able to judge turn times a little better than that.

The cornbread was very good and the artichoke was out of this world good and after that it all kind of went down hill. Mom had the Macho Salad which she enjoyed but she also asked for no goat cheese and they forgot about that.

I ordered the filet rare and it came out medium rare but I chose not to send it back. While it was still enjoyable it definitely wasn't as good as it could've been. They also forgot the worcestershire butter which I think is delicious and definitely took away from the meal.

Dad ordered the filet medium-rare and they brought it to the table butterflied, completely unacceptable. It's a "center cut" filet and it's not difficult to cook medium-rare, as evidenced by mine. The second one they brought out for him was overcooked and didn't even appear to be a quality cut of meat. He decided to opt not for the 3rd strike and ate it anyway.

Our server insisted on removing my dad's meal from the ticket, which was very nice, but we would've rather had an enjoyable meal and paid full price any night of the week. Bandera again? Maybe, but I'm definitely more inclined to seek out new options in the future.From St. Louis? Missing your IMO's Pizza? Then you need to go here for your Pizza fix!

I recently had family visiting from St. Louis and was told we need to check out Frasher's. 

Decor/Atmosphere: If you've ever been to a Ma & Pop Steak House in WI then you'll feel right at home. It's a pretty dark and old with some huge circle booths surrounding the table. There is St. Louis memorabilia all over the walls. 

Service: ehh - we probably had to wait about 15 minutes from when we placed our drink order to when we placed our food order. She was friendly and knowledgeable but would have loved to see her a little more often....

Food: If you've never tried the St. Louis style pizza you really should! A thin crust pizza topped with the amazing Provel cheese and sausage. It's much higher priced then good ol' IMOs back in Missouri but I'll pay the price to get it out here in the valley. The toasted ravioli was among the best I have ever had. The loaded potato skins were loaded with pretty much loaded to the max - a little loaded for my taste with cheese, onions, bacon, black beans, and I'm sure a few other things that I'm forgetting (I'd personally prefer TGIFridays). I ordered the Provel Chicken Sandwich because it had provel in the name - meaning I should love it. I was pretty disappointed with the sandwich though. The fried chicken was a little tough to bite through but was moist on the inside but there was a severe lack of provel cheese from what I was envisioning. The complimentary bread served with some flavored butter is pretty awesome though!

If you're from St. Louis they have the book for you to sign and of course write down which high school you went to.

Summary: Go for the pizza, bread, and toasted ravioli.This place is great to hit the links for cheap. It is always fun to hit up Coronado for a twilight 9 in early summer. Course is on par with the fees but I still recommend it if you want to play on a budget.I came here with a few friends about a week ago for dinner. I ordered the egg drop soup and broccoli with chicken. Overall, it was good but not great. The egg drop soup was extremely hot, even 20 minutes after I got it, but was ok tasting. The broccoli and chicken was good just had too much sauce for my taste. 

I'd probably have lunch here next time instead of dinner.The turkey sausage and egg sandwich I had was pretty bland. It's a chain though so you kind of expect it. The eggs looked like rubber. I wouldn't try to go here, but the staff is nice so if you have to no big deal.I eat here from time to time when I am in Phoenix for business.  The sushi is ok.  I tend to be attracted to all-you-can-eat sushi and Sushi 101 is adequate for this specialty cuisine.  I usually sit at the bar.  The speed of service could be better as it always seems either the sushi chefs or the servers are complaining about working too many hours.  The variety on the all-you-can-eat menu is extensive enough for most nominal sushi-lovers.I like Z-Tejas, but I just can't get past the just average seafood enchiladas.  It's short on taste, short on seafood, and big on spinach and other filler. See Barrio and Tradiciones for kick ass seafood enchiladas.

The decor is very upscale chainy, but I dig the AZ, NM, TX flags...it's a nice display even though it is designed to remind you you're at a Southwestern place.  Subtlety, everyone, subtlety.

Since then I've ordered differently.  You can't go wrong with their chicken avocado sandwich.  But I do have top say, I get excited thinking about the queso, cornbread and the catfish beignet.  I don't know what they do to the catfish or the beignet crustorama, but it makes me giddy come time for each Z-Tejas visit.  As for the cornbread, I'll second Max's comment about it.  

I can't speak to the margaritas though....since I'm usually there for business lunches or business dinners.  Hiccup, um what was that, boss?Good place to go for a few drinks and an ok meal. Tvs With the games. Its as standard as cookie cutter restaurants go. Good female bartender, makes good drinks, by good i mean strongI thought the food was average, the service average, and the environment (yet again) average. I have had Indian food many times before, and often I will order the same dish at different restaurants to find the best. My personal favorite Indian dish is Lamb Korma (yogurt-based curry), and theirs was not as good as most that I've had. The daal, on the other hand, was amazing and had garbanzo beans in it rather than whatever other bean usually goes in daal which really made it amazing. The naan was not bad either. As far as the service goes, I and my group were ignored (even though there were three tables filled in the entire restaurant) when we were done eating, and we had to go and hunt down a waiter. The environment was all-right, but I did find the constant blaring of the Indian beauty pageant and music videos a little annoying (because of the volume), but certainly interesting to watch.Good selection of sandwiches & salads. I really like the thick hearty bread, but it's probably not the healthiest thing in the world (especially when it's thoroughly buttered). I really like the Sedona Salad - fresh spinach (really fresh), cranberries, deliciously spiced nuts, and tons of feta cheese. Again, I'm not sure how healthy this salad is with all the cheese and buttered bread, but it is a damn fine filling lunch.I've been to Haji-Baba's a couple of times now and I must say... my visits have not been met with consistency in the quality of their food.  

Haji-Baba is SUPER popular as you can see by the Yelp reviews of this place.  The main reason for their popularity I think is due to their prices.  Their prices are almost ridiculously low for the portion sizes you get when compared to other Mediterranean ~ Greek type of restaurants. 
    
I did find something I liked at Haji-Baba. I recommend you try their Gyros.  It's a really good Gyros and is one of the best in the Phoenix metro.  They don't shave their Gyros meat like at the other places.  They cut their Gyros meat off in long chunks, different sizes.  This adds another level of "delicious-ness" when compared to Gyros at other locations.  

They OVER STUFF their Gyros with meat, a small amount of tomatoes, red onions and pickled wild cucumbers with some tzatziki sauce.  The pickled wild cucumbers were unexpected and a nice change from other plaecs that serve Gyros.  My Gyros needed a bit more tzatziki, but my server was slammed and forgot it, oh well.

As for everything else on their menu ~ meh, I've had better.  Their dolmades, rice and kibbee all tasted old and over cooked.  The shawarma and falafels also tasted over cooked and were very dry for my liking.  

Restaurant location and condition~ 2 to 3 stars
Service ~ 3 stars
Food ~ 2 to 3 stars (except for the Gyros which are 4.5 stars)
Prices ~ 5 plus stars

I'm looking forward to going back for another Gyros and maybe I'll try their hummus and/or a Greek salad on my next.  Hope to see you there.I really like that Macayo's has a refreshing Taco Salad instead of the normal slathered in lard refried beans & cheese salads that a lot of other places offer. This particular location is giant, with a big outdoor patio and a very large inside. I've only been here for work lunches so it's never crowded and the service has been fine. The menu has a lot of Tex-Mex choices so there is something for everyone. I really like the chips & salsa, enchiladas, and taco salad...nothing mind blowing but it's good for lunch.i would've given this review a def. 2**
based upon their bloated prices
and throw away garments
if not soley for the cute girls that work here, most of whom are super friendly.
1* for their revolving sale rack
1* for their huge ass selection
1* for the cute hipster girls who work here
(IMPO however, if you're going to pay that much for clothes made by tiny children in sweat shops, why not just cross the street and buy some good quality clothes made by american workers paid at an honest wage fr AA? worth considering)Customer service is pretty good.  Dining areas are pretty small.  

We got the antipasto salad - at first it was worrisome because all the salads are separated by iceburg, spinach or mix of both and priced as such.  I was hoping I wasn't paying 9 dollars for some bagged salad mix.  This was was decent - they layered ham, cheese and salami and sliced it into strips to put on top of the salad.  Salad had tomatoes, green and black olives, cucumbers, artichoke hearts as well to fill it out.  We subbed garlic bread for the italian bread and I have to agree - it is one of the best garlic bread I've ever had.  Its not all greasy, yet full of flavor.  Really enjoyed this part of the meal.

We ordered the big 6 pizza with thick crust.  It was decent, but I'm not sure I'm a fan of the sweet pizza sauce.  If you don't mind the sweetness of the pizza sauce you'll love it.  The flavoring and texture wasn't bad considering how thick the crust was (its thick throughout the whole slice), you'd expect it to be on the bland side.

Next time we'll try the thin crust and see how it is but I had a love/hate thing going with the sweetness of the pizza.Its ok.....It's cheap and close to work.This steakhouse was pretty decent. Everything was cooked to how we liked it but there just wasn't any wow factor. I felt it was a bit over priced for what we got while comparing to other steakhouses. Honestly, it really wasn't any better than Outback Steakhouse. Also our server just so happened to be the same server from IHop a few days earlier.
The best part of our night was when Stephan Hawking came (after an ASU science convention he spoke at) in for dinner with some other scientists!!!! Now THAT was pretty damn cool!Let me be the first to pile on Casey Moore's with review number 72!  

As a place to go drinking with friends-4 stars.  Great atmosphere, diverse crowd, good stuff on tap (my favorite is the Four Peaks Scottish Amber), great outdoor seating area.

For dining they get 3 stars.  It has been several months since I left New England and Casey Moore's is my first venture out for seafood, albeit with diminished expectations.  That being said, my Fish & Chips ($11.00, Cod, not the Haddock overhanging the plate I had grown accustomed to) was pretty good.  The fish was lightly battered and done just right-moist, tender, soft and juicy.  The chips were skin -on fries.

My wife had Salmon Oscar.  The salmon was slightly overdone, and the crab and hollandaise sauce was a little too fishy.  She ordered a double cooked baked potato that looked and tasted exactly like the prefab twice baked potato's that came with some Omaha Steaks I received from my boss last Christmas.  There were also slices of zucchini and yellow squash which were sauteed with mild seasoning.

The waitress was outstanding and gave us unbiased recommendations such as: "I would stay away from the Surf & Turf.  We just don't go through enough lobster and the kitchen doesn't always do a great job with it.  It gets sent back sometimes."  Good to know.  She also recommended the Salt Cellar for great Fish & Chips. 

Overall, I would give them 3 stars and I would return for Fish & Chips and drinking.My wife and I played Ken McDonald on 11/6/11, we were paired up with a couple of pleasant and knowledgable older guys. KM overseeded last month and still had 90 degree cart rules, but the conditions were great. We had never played KM, but we appreciate the courses with a little age and mature trees, etc. The trees can come into play if you're spray the ball. The tee boxes, fairways and greens were in great shape and the greens rolled pretty true. The rough had spotty grass in some areas and hard pan, but never anything that wasn't playable.  They have a nice lighted driving range, 2 practice greens & 1 large chipping green. There were quite a few walkers, which I'm not used to, but we still finished our round on Sunday in just under 4 and a half hours. The cart girl was a cute little blonde that couldn't have been nicer-- the $3 beers were a nice change too. For what it costs, KM is a very good deal and fun to play. We are already planning our return to KM.I have a love/hate relationship with Fry's Electronics.

Going there and trying to get any help that knows anything about anything is so frustrating it makes me want to punt a kitten.  (Not really, I actually looove animals...figure of speech and all.  Please don't call Sheriff Joe's animal posse on me.)

The answer to that problem?  ONLY come here if you already know what you want, EXACTLY.  Then, unless you can't navigate the dizzying maze of half stocked shelves and larger than life golf themed displays (Golf...really? WTF?) you'll still be forced to ask one of the worthless, necktie wearing donkeys where something is located.  Good luck with that.  :/  

It seems that Fry's store is big enough to have one of each item and in each color, hard drive size, length, speed, etc.  But that is simply NOT the case.  Their ordering is obviously done by a schizophrenic man (with one eye) who only works part time.  It's hit or miss if you'll find what you need when you go, but you may find something *close* to what you wanted...  Hope you get lucky and what you needed is actually on the shelf that day (or that the worthless necktie wearing tits can help you locate it) otherwise I hope that 'close enough' is good enough for you.

I can't really speak to competitive pricing because I usually go here when I need something that some place else isn't likely to carry.  But, I did just happen to get a graphing calculator for my teenage daughter for $109.00 and I *know* I could have picked up the exact same one at WalMart for about $89.00 if I had ordered it Site To Store, but I needed to get it that same day, and couldn't wait 24 hours for WalMart to order it for me.

Aside from those small complaints, and the ridiculously oversized check out area (50 registers and only two to four open at any given time) I actually DO like Fry's.

In fact, my whole family refers to Fry's Electronics as 'Donkey Island' from Pinocchio.

Indeed it is...  It has all the wicked, yet oh-so alluring temptations that I must resist buying, and it is utterly populated with ignorant jackasses.lEveryone raves about kiss the cook.  It's ok but there are some other places just as good.  Menu is fairly limited.  Muffins come with each order.  Waitresses are fun and sassy.
Place is usually crowded when we go in.  Like I said, everyone goes crazy over it but me and for me it's ok.My wife and I wanted to try somewhere different for lunch.  She loves mexican food.  Well we decided to try Baja Fresh.  The food was ok.   I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.   I would rather eat rubios or chipotle to be honest.  The table was dirty and we had to ask it be cleaned.  The service was quick though.Packed house, stiff plentiful drinks, and very perky prices.  They also have karaoke!  So give'em a shot.  I did!I checked out Enochs on Friday and I had a good time.  The band was playing decent music, not my taste, but I got into it, and the people were cool.  Many different types of people, so it kept things interesting.  My only problem was that it was impossible to order a drink.  No one ever came to our table and when I went to the bar, it was nearly impossible to get the bartenders attention. But overall, I had a good time, and in the end that is all that really matters.Something non chain on the land of the walking dead. Average. Blue hairs like the one price for everything deal, requires less thinking on their part. Instead of a coat check room they have a walker check. Live music on some nightsIts awesome to finally find a 24 hr Mexican food joint! It did take a long time to get my food but it was well worth the wait.This car wash is a gem of Sun City West.  Formerly called Classic Auto Wash, I am pretty sure I have reviewed them before, but I cannot find that review. 

The prices are reasonable, and the crew there does a good job.  I have only had funky glass from them once or twice.  They spend extra time on the wheels and chrome that most car washes really leave lacking.  The waiting room is nice, and bathrooms are clean usually.

Typical price for a ultimate / hand wash (that doesn't go through the machine) is $20.Stayed here for 2 nights for 4th of July weekend this year. Boy was it HOT! Never felt heat like that before.

The hotel was great. Not much to do though... 

Plus:
+ I spent 3 days tanning all day by the pool sipping on Pina Coladas! (Pina Coladas were yummy, but spending all day by the pool for the whole weekend, is kind of boring... there's nothing to do there)
+ Best bath products I've used in a hotel!
+ fireplace in the courtyard, but who wants to sit next to a fireplace when it's over 100 degrees.
+ pet friendly
+ good breakfast (room service) cute mickey mouse pancakes!
+ water & apples in lobby
+great size room & bathroom.

Negative:
- NO DECENT FOOD! The food at the pool wasn't that great, even the bbq on 4th of July by the pool wasn't good either. Italian place on the bottom of the hotel was blah. The lounge food was okay... selection was really small!
- Pool was really crowded.
- The movie that weekend got canceled.
- you have to pay for hotel postcards! (Most hotels give it for free)
- Bad location! In the middle of no where.

This will be my first and last visit. Come here if you just want to be in the middle of no where doing nothing but lay at the pool.I hate this airport.  And I love this airport.

The airport is a pain in the behind if you are running on a tight schedule and have a car to drop off.  LAS security lines can be horrendously long so plan ahead.  It's crowded, full of amateur travelers and has cramped gates.

But, it's also a cool place to hang out if you are early and have time to kill.  Shopping and dining options abound, especially before security.  And of course, the gaming machines!!!!  As a recent convert to video poker, I delight in the ability to lose another $100 just before I board my flight.  Vegas, you have perfected the art of yanking every loose dollar from our pockets and I salute you!

The bars at McCarran ID everybody.  Period.  No exceptions.  A few months ago, they asked for ID from someone in a wheelchair, with a ventilator and a colostomy bag who turned out to be 100 years old (which wasn't bad because the bartender bought free drinks for all to celebrate the century!!!)

But really, you had to ID that dude before giving him his Jack and coke?  What. EVAR.

One of the less mentioned facts about McCarran is its absolutely incredible ability to handle logistics - baggage claim and taxi lines - during the giant conventions that plague Las Vegas.  I have never seen such efficiency elsewhere - this would do Toyota proud in terms of cycle time measurements!!!  Amazing!

Lounges are "meh" but there are plenty of ways to keep yourself entertained.  LAS is the best place in the world for people watching because you will see every weird nuance of humanity represented her.  Promise you that!  

Anyway, back to video poker before I close... last time, I won $40.  Next time, I clean house.  I will get you McCarran airport... just you wait!!!!

~ 3 stars overall for giving me yet another love-hate relationship in my life.  I need these like I need to step on a cactus with bare feet but hey, they're free :\  But go to Vegas people, McCarran is just a way-point on your journey to insane wealth in the Sin City :D

# 224This airport is easy to navigate and is close to the strip.  Food choices are heavy on fried stuff (at least in Delta terminal) but there's a pretty good variety.

Bathrooms are clean. Security line was really efficient.  I lost big in Vegas and was very depressed flying out, but  I won't let that fact allow me to give this a negative review.  I'll leave that for my own behavior (that gets zero stars)I was expecting to be hit with a cloud of cigarette smoke when I got off the plane, but didn't which was a nice surprise. For where this is located, it's an okay airport. I definitely know where I'm at with all the slot machines around.If they hadn't built the new terminal my review for this place would be less than 3 stars.  Considering that Las Vegas is a hot spot for frequent vistors, I think they should start making the upgrades to the old terminal.  Both terminals are pretty straight forward though as I don't think I've ever been confused finding where the taxi lines are, waiting for a limo driver or looking for baggage claim.  

Oh and I should say that Las Vegas is just not the same without the slot machines at the airport especially when you have those last minute win itches =)A less positive experience than others this time.  Basically, everyone else who has left one, two or three stars has said it all.  Las Vegas to Phoenix Flight 171 on April 17, 2014, I'm stuck here for the next nine hours, despite my early bird check in.  The reason the airline mentioned for this less positive experience is that someone forgot to process the check-ins.  I guess someone woke up one day and decided, oh, I'm not going to do my job today.  I used to always avoid this airline because of the unnecessary and tremendous stress and chaos, but since the assigned numbers in A, B or C, I recently decided to come back.  I'm not so sure after today.  Overall, the low cost and convenient locations cause me to buy from them and the service is adequate.  Fingers crossed for more positive experiences again, in the future.  As for this trip, well, you know how life is sometimes.  Things could always be worse.The Golgen Gate Hotel and Casino is one of the oldest facility, established in 1906. If the case apply and price is the main criteria when sorting hotels, this is quite an honest choice. The room itself is quite small, about 15 feet x 15 feet. Although, all the furnitures have been updated, from the bed setting to the flat screen tv. DO NOT GET ROOM 337, It overviews the rooftop. Ask for a room that looks out onto the Freemont Street Experience. A dissapointing feature about the room, the shower!!!!! Its a locker room shower!!!! Dont forget to bring your flip-flops! It is conveniently located but if you plan a walk to the Strip, its a 30-45 min walk just to get to Circus Circus. If you have not been to Vegas in awhile, it has changed and not necesarely for the best.I'm only rating the food and I'll say it was NOT worth waiting 30 min+ in line for the late night specials. Let me explain...

$4 steak...not bad, but not great.

My wife liked her saimin, nothing special to me...

The banana fritter was OK, but REALLY SMALL.

The last time I checked there are some pretty big Hawaiian people, so how can this place be for Hawaiians?!

It is like Asia when you walk up in there though...made me a bit uncomfortable.

The food was OK, I left with a big helping of "disappointment."If you're going to come here to gamble, I suggest you don't. There are other casinos here on Fremont St. that seem to make you feel more comfortable and not old fashioned. Well if you do like old fashioned, I guess this is the place for you. I can't really rate this place for how it is hotel-wise and staff wise, as I just come here strictly to walk through and eat at the Market Cafe. So my rating isn't for the hotel, but just the basic layout and how old fashioned it is. I know this place won't change the way it looks as they're probably preserving the looks of old Vegas with this place.

I'm probably the only person to rate this place a 3 stars, so I'm probably missing something on how good the hotels are at this place. Sorry to say though, I probably wont ever experience staying at this hotel or any hotel in Vegas for awhile as long as my sister lives down here. All in all thank goodness this place has market cafe, otherwise this place probably won't exist for me.Hotel is like an extension of the islands.  Good friends are always there, but the accomodations are mediocre.  Highlight is the eatery called "Aloha Specialties".  

Bottom line is that if you are from the islands and miss the aina, then swing on by to hear some pidgin and to get some local grinz.Okay, I will admit right off the bat that I'm not a fan of Vega$. The place is a hell hole (the high was 106 when we were there the first weekend in June!) and it's really just an elaborate (and I mean really elaborate) way to con people out of their money. So, why were we there? Celebrating a friend's birthday. We were only spending one night and we wanted to stay someplace decent, but not too expensive. The California fit the bill. It was nice but not ostentatious; we're not those kinds of people--not Motel 6, but not too fancy either. The room was clean and comfortable. I did not like that internet service wasn't free. Come on, what century are we in? This is VERY uncommon and cost you a star. The view from our room was pretty crappy as well--a parking garage? Bleh. We could also hear the pounding music from Fremont until the wee hours. Can we do something about outside noise, maybe? Which brings me to noise--our air conditioner was so loud that we had to lean a chair against it to muffle the noise or we wouldn't have been able to sleep. I'm not going to complain about the casino, because I would complain about every casino--nasty, smoky places. A positive is that I forgot my book in the room and we were able to retrieve it several hours later, even though we had checked out. I really appreciated that. So, all in all, the room was okay, but nothing really special. Free Wi-Fi would have made our stay much nicer!We stayed at the Golden Nugget the last night of our honeymoon.  We had stayed on the strip, and thought it would be cool to stay on Fremont Street the last night.  They have done some upgrades to the property, but coming from the modern hotels on the strip I felt like I was taking a downgrade.  The one redeeming feature they have is the shark tank by the pool.  It was really cool to swim near the tank and use the water slide that goes through the tank.So is this place called Mamita's or Mamacita's?!?! 

When you walk into this dump it's like Vegas and Mexico threw up on each other or something like that, it's very interesting to say the least. 
It's right across the street from El Cortez hotel, so that alone should give you a clue of what kind of place this is going to be lol. 

I noticed this place because I was outside on the curb of El Cortez waiting in line for my Punk Rock Bowling tickets in 90 degrees at 11am, drinking some hot Jack n coke in a plastic cup. My friend and I were debating whether to eat here or the cafe, and ended up here. I think at this point I would eaten anything lol. 

Since I was in Vegas I started off with a strawberry margarita, because well, I really love margaritas. Also, it is completely acceptable to keep drinking all day, even before noon in Vegas, so why the hell not. I then ordered a chicken taco and enchilada combo plate with rice and beans. It was probably not the best Mexican food, but it really hit the spot and plus they gave me a decent amount of sour cream, so I devoured that plate, lol. 

My friend ordered a Cuban sandwich and beer, but they were out of Cuban beer, so fail right there. Also, his sandwich came on some questionable bread, so yea overall fail on the Cuban menu. The bread in the picture looked way better. Overall, my food was pretty good, but my friend's not so good. 

The service was also pretty terrible, they take forever to take your order, get your order, and if you need anything else after your meal finally arrives, forget about it!!!! They weren't even that busy until maybe the end our meal. This place is cheap and convenient though if you happen to be in Downtown Vegas. 

Apparently that Selena live in concert DVD is constantly playing, which is only awesome the first time through.I really, really, really wish these guys would invest some money in their decor.  It's a real turn off.  The food is great but I sometimes pass by and go somewhere else because I don't like the way it looks inside.The music was cool, the crowd was not too great, and for the guys, the bartenders were hot because well, they wear bikinis! The club seemed a bit outdated and dirty mainly because the decor were falling apart. People left after 15-20 minutes.The plusses: the room is about 350 sq. feet. After being around crowds all day, it's nice to have a little breathing room. The sheets are soft, and an abundance of pillows, too.

The minuses: getting to your room is like walking the hallways of the damned. I forgot my room number - that's how long it took. Diamond Lounge is only open for 4-5 hours a day, like the early bird special. 

And, it's a $20 cab ride to the airport? When did that happen?!Went there due to recomendations and was told to try one of the fish dishes ended up deciding on the Mariscos Verrados i think. wasnt really impressed.  I give it to the cook scallops la it was not over cooked the flavors were brought out well just a little better than all the rest except for Bonita Michocan.  Service was great couldnt have had a better waiter  My wife had the rellanos and said mine were better.  My sons had some cheese enchiladas and they were just ok.  Margarita was mixed very well had it on the rocks.  However with the price that it came to be just not quite worth it.  Ive had much better meals at other places for much less.This place is definitely catered towards non-asians with a large bank roll!

That being said...we didn't really expect to eat authentic Asian food here since it is an "Asian Fusion" restaurant.  

Decor:  Awesome.  Very trendy/hip/spacious restaurant.  

Service:  Great.  

Food:  Good but overpriced.  We paid $12 for a calamari appetizer which was really your typical deep fried squid with spicy salt dish that you can order at any Chinese restaurant for $7-8 with double/triple the serving amount.  And it usually tastes better at a hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant.  Their rolls were good and everything tasted fresh.How thrlled was I to find a Target much closer to where I live. Although it seems a bit smaller than the Maryland Pkwy, that's not particularly a bad thing for me. It was well stocked and had everything I'd ever look for in a Target. The people working there were friendly and I got in and out in 10 minutes (I was on a mission).
Nice discovery for me.+1 star because this is where I go to get my bloody hands on Walking Dead stuff!  It's super close to my work.  I just can't give it much more than that because this Toys R Us is in the middle of what can be a rough neighborhood.  In the words of South Park's Eric Cartman, it's "In the Ghetto...In the Ghetttttooooo....."

I mean, this Toys R Us has probably seen much better days.  The outside looks so run down and 'vintage', it's so ready for a paint job.  All you can see are those little spikes on each letter of the sign, the spikes that keep the pigeons at bay.  But be careful!  There is pigeon poop galore along the front walls of the store.  Ick.

Go inside, and it's just as worn out.  The floors are dirty, the shelves look sickly, and often times the toy pegs are bare!  It's just in sad, sad shape for the most part.  This Toys R Us needs a new interior designer, and quickly!  Someone bring in that guy from that show on that network.  Yeah, that guy.  Or just bring in Candice Olson or Genevieve Gorder from HGTV or Tanya Memme from A&E to spruce up the place.  What??  Damn straight I know only the hottie female interior designers!  

Interior aside, the most important thing is that Toys R Us carries TOYS.  Lots and lots of toys.  For little kids, sure there is everything they could want usually in stock - Power Wheels, kiddie pools, slides, bicycles, Lego, Skylanders, Barbie, Hello Kitty, Justin Bieber posters, just about anything.  But for us big kids?  It's so hard to find those toys!  Especially those collector edition or 'Only at Toys R Us' big boy toys!  I can't tell you how many times I went over there on the first day a new limited edition Walking Dead toy...ahem, 'Action Figure'...should be out in stores and in stock, only to find it hasn't arrived yet!  Or it came, and some Butthead (or Beavis) hoarded the entire case!  You friggin' Ebay resellers you, tick off us actual collectors.  Leave some for me..err..us! 

Service is often an issue at this Toys R Us as well.  Sometimes this place can be barren of workers in red shirts!  You literally have to walk to the customer service stand to get a hold of an employee for help.  And on a day where there's restocking going on?  Good luck getting one of the old folks to leave their post of unboxing toys.  It can get quite irritating, especially when you're looking for someting in particular, like the new series of Walking Dead figures.  Show me the zombie!  

I'll keep coming here after work as long as they keep stocking the action figures that I really want.  Otherwise, I usually just shop at a few toy places online that cater to the big boys like me!  Toys R Us please get your act together and tidy up your store.  Oh, and stock more Walking Dead please!I can't say this is my favorite mall. It has your basic stores and some stores I would never go to.  The crowd isn't that great either. The only reason I wanted to come here the other day was because of Potato Corner - I don't have to go to L.A. for it anymore, yay! Eons ago, my sister would take me to this mall and it wasn't too bad back then but that was pre-Fashion Show Mall. Think of a mall version of Walmart.  Eeek!

The stores we went to were Hot Topic (they have Little Mermaid items!), Disney Store (Vinylmation Little Mermaid characters!), Forever 21 (very small store with limited selections) and Potato Corner (yummy fries).

Although this is the closest mall to home, I'd rather drive a few miles out of the way and go to a better mall. I'd come here maybe once a year but since they have Potato Corner, I might have to go here more often just for that reason.It cheaper and is on the strip.  Gambling is cheaper to from what you have to start off with.  It has alot of people but rooms are smaller.Just stopped by to check out  Popcornopolis. Ended up trying a couple flavors BBQ and Pumpkin Spice. Both were good, bought a bag of the Pumpkin Spice. 

Service is good, we were greeted right away by one worker then later offered samples by another.

As for the Excalibur itself we never stayed here so it's hard to review it. Maybe about ten years ago we ate at their steakhouse which was good. 

Casino looks good, lots of table games and good mix of slots. Though I've never won here I still come to try my luck. Good location and you can catch the tram to the Luxor or Mandalay, best of all it's FREE!So, you want to go to Vegas.

And you don't want to shell out for Bellagio or MGM.

And you don't want to stay at the no-tell motel where you have to wonder - is that stain on the sheet spaghetti sauce? blood? other bodily waste?

You get the picture. 

Well, then Excalibur is the place for you. The Vegas version of a medieval castle, they captured the "dark that no sunlight can penetrate" quality that is no doubt quite authentic. However, it is also quite centrally located. I had a conference at MGM and Excalibur was literally across the street, which made my life easy. I'm a walker, so I traveled up and down the Strip on foot, but if you don't want to trek so extensively,  you can easily catch the Monorail at MGM. Also, Excalibur, Luxor, and Mandalay Bay are all connected by shuttle and escalators so you can wander among three casino/hotels for the price of one! 

The rooms are budget but the cost is budget, too. The beds are clean and reasonably comfortable. There is no desk but the table with chairs is suitable for work. The bathroom is large enough, with a roomy shower stall. (No bathtub, so if that's really important to you, there you go. You'll have to shower.) Personally, my biggest gripe was no WiFi (really?) and being constrained by wired Internet. I felt like I'd been transported back to 2005. Otherwise, my room left me with no complaints. 

There are some okay restaurants and shows (the joust is fun and they have the Thunder from Down Under if you're looking to check out a different kind of sword fight) but even if you're not into what Excalibur has to offer, the location makes up for it. Seriously, just go to any one of the myriad of entertainment options within a very short walking distance. 

Overall, Excalibur is what you probably expect it to be. It's not luxurious. People crazy enough to bring children to Vegas often stay there. It's a little old and tired and depressing (especially in the casino section) but it is what you're probably looking for if you're scouring reviews about this establishment: a convenient, relatively clean and safe place to crash on the Vegas Strip.After a night of drinking and karaoke at Ellis, I was starved and saw this pizza joint. I do have to say the food was good but I was a little tipsy when I had it. I would have to give it another shot sober to see how it really tasted. 

I do have one recommendation, and that is to put extra, cold shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the warm pizza. It is the most fantastic thing. I remember having it just like it when I was in college and it is the best. If you don't believe me try it and you will be hooked. 

The price was not too expensive and the extra cheese only cost 50 cents extra, which in my mind was well worth it. I will try it again sometime and maybe I will be sober next time I try it again, but I offer no guarantee. I will, however, guaranteed there will be some extra cold cheese on my next pizza.Let me just say that I have had the Spago experience in LA, and in Vegas before.  Been pleased.  So, when Absinthe ended this past Sunday night, and we were hungry for pizza (and knowing the Trump shuttle where we were staying shows up right below Spago), we stopped in for a pizza.  We were very clear to the Hostess that that was all we wanted, and admirably we didn't feel discriminated upon for only wanting such a small Spago experience.  We were led to a table for two in the back.  I ordered a $9 Cabernet and husband ordered tea.  We agreed on a pizza which was described as such: 

ITALIAN SAUSAGE-Roasted Fennel, Tuscan Black Olives, Reggiano Cheese and Thyme 

  We were brought out a divided dish of olive oil, butter, salt and pepper.  And baskets were brought around with foccacia, sourdough and flatbread.  Nice, but one can only do so much bread, ya know?  Then came the pizza and sadly it was disappointing!  Honestly, both of us agreed that it tasted like the crust had been pre-frozen.   We got better pizza at the Wicked Spoon buffet the next day.  Toppings were nice, but the crust was very disappointing.  

  It was not bad.  But it wasn't (imho) up to what we had experienced via Wolfgang in the past.  (nobody on the planet could be a bigger fan than me of his butternut squash soup that I would (and have) killed for),

  This time I can only say that  we've had better.  But we are appreciative of the experience.I was disappointed by how shallow the lunch menu was.  The caesar salad and caprese salad my wife and I shared were 3 star worthy. But, I expected more.This Mexican restaurant is located inside the Venetian. If you eat here, make sure to get a seat "outside" next to the canal. Eating here is quite mind boggling when you consider that the whole atmosphere is a sham. No, you're not in Venice. And no, you're not outside. It really doesn't matter when you're sipping a delicious strawberry margarita and watching the gondolas float by. No matter how odd it may be, everything just works together to give you an interesting, if not wonderful, eating experience.

The sangria's and margarita's are great, the service is good, and the food passes in my book. The chips and salsa are delicious. I definitely suggest getting some guacamole to accompany your crunchy treat. The soups and taquito's were also yummy. I got a chicken ceasar salad as my main course, and unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed. Let's just say I've had better. Aside from that, I really enjoyed my experience at Cañonita's and wouldn't mind giving it another shot in the future.The wife and I went to this place with one of my Bulgarian coworkers on a Tuesday night.  Having never had Bulgarian food before, we basically just got whatever my friend recommended.  Some roast meat, sausage, a nice yogurt salad along with a couple of shots of grappa which somehow messed me up enough not to drive home.  Dessert was quite good too.  

There was a band playing that night so it was quite loud and dark but still a fun atmosphere with food that wasn't bad.  I wouldn't come here w/o my Bulgarian friends though as 2 Asians would seriously stick out like a sore thumb here.I'm simply not a huge fan of LV bags etc, so I just can't bring myself to rate them higher...  but a good friend is... so I accompanied her on her shopping expedition.

She picked up the LV dog tags necklace and I gotta admit, it's pretty damn cute.     

The salesperson who helped my friend was top notch, even when an older, significantly hairsprayed, overly made up woman barged in... rudely interrupting my friends questions about her prospective purchase and yelled at the salesperson ....  "Excuse ME, I'm here to pick up my bag!"

We all looked at each other in a brief moment of disbelief before our salesperson gently excused herself for a moment, was VERY polite to this obnoxious tart....finding someone to help her...   and then slyly looked at us upon return and said "yea, like I should know who she is."

LOVE her.  

Give that girl a raise.Hmmmm, kinda confused . . . Start from the beginning, sat at the sushi bar, cause teppan had a long wait. Promptly greeted by waitress and placed a drink order. I was ready to order from the sushi chef, but he never acknowledged me or looked my way. The waitress took my full order and went from there. Received my sashimi combo and was quite pleased by the quantity, freshness and presentation. Now the confusion, I was ready to pay with some gift cards, but was told they couldn't be applied to the bill because they're not really part of Benihana per say. . . ? Huh? Just the trepan is. Huh? I've been to other Benihanas and the sushi bar is part of the restaurant. The sushi chef and the waitress both began to apologize and explain the situation, which I did understand, but still bummed I couldn't use $75 of gift cards. Good meal and service, wanted to spend that $75 on the tables . . .This is the largest watch store in North America.  They carry a huge variety of brands and although some of the staff is stuffy, some of them are nice as well.  You can only neogotiate prices on watches above $500 and then expect to get no more than 10%-15% off retail prices.  This store is great for seeing watches in person, not so great for buying them.Location location location.  This place is a total dive, featuring what I think can best be summarized as 'truck stop chic' - but it is located just off the strip behind the Flamingo.  With drinks at the bar of your typical club running $8-12, the thought of a little in-room pre-gaming isn't bad.  And Stage Door knows it.

Smaller bottles are of most liquors are about $12, while a standard sized bottle is about $25.  Big bottles are over $30.  Red Bulls are $3 each and half a gallon of orange juice is $5.  Yeah, they're gouging you, but it is still cheaper than going out.

If you're nearby, at Ballys, Caesars, or the Flamingo, definitely worth going to...unless you can find another place.Like the other high-end Strip hotels in Vegas, the Wynn is beautiful.  We upgraded to a 60th floor room overlooking the strip with floor to ceiling windows (with really cool push-button controls).  It was still less than $200/night.  The casino is relatively small compared to the other nicer hotels.  It's hard to find blackjack less than $15/hand.  Also, their dining program has recently taken a huge hit with the closure of Alex.  The Wynn is also very far north and it's about 1.5 miles to get to the middle of the strip.

We stayed there because I had a convention there (and they gave us a great rate).  However, if we have our choice next time, we'll stay somewhere slightly nicer and more centrally located.As this location is a bit off The Strip I can imagine that it wouldn't be as busy as some of the other downtown locations. This Cafe was small in comparison to others I have been in and the store was tiny! 
The food, of course, was as great as it always is. They have a couple new items on their menus (apparently these were added last week, lucky us!). I would recommend everything except the Peanut Butter tiny dessert thing. I love peanut butter, don't get me wrong, but this was lacking another flavor. It tasted like I dipped my spoon in a jar of smooth peanut butter. There should have been another layer of chocolate sauce or cookies, or graham crackers. That would have been top notch then. 
All in all, a great experience.Vegas's only Gay Leather Bar.  But, I don't think I've ever seen anyone wearing any leather in there.

Big wood tables and pool tables and the oldest bartenders in Vegas.  Whooo party.  See, the Buffalo is a 24 joint.  It's certainly where the queer riff raff hangs out when Gipsy shuts down for the night. It's the gay after hours.  Hmmmm.......after hours in a 24 hour town, Ironic, don't you think?

The Buffalo is not without it's own unique charm.  And personally I've gotten into some trouble there myself.  And by "trouble" I mean drunken debauchery.  Whoooo party!The casino review is below..... 

Review for the restaurant - 
$7.99: 10-ounce steak. Includes salad or soup, potato, bread, green beans and a beer 

Our server was MIA most of the time. Took well over 40 minutes for our dinner to come out. Some of the tables that were seated well after us were either eating, or getting their checks before we saw our dinner. 

Steak - Both of us ordered Medium Rare. J's was almost blue. Seared but still very pink in the center. But it was warm to the touch, so he decided to not send it back. Now this I cant understand. You almost under-cook a steak, but its still tough!? How do you accomplish that feat?! My steak on the other hand was more on the well done side than medium rare. Terrible. I took maybe 2 bites. I'm sure boot leather would have tasted better. J ate maybe 1/4 of his steak. He's a huge steak fan, so that's gotta show you that something is wrong. 

Salad (mine) - You can't really screw up a salad. 
Soup (J's) - He said it was "alright". 

Baked Potato - This was the best part of the whole meal. 

Green Beans - This was a tie for the best part of the meal. Lots of garlic, which J and I love. 

Bread - Love sourdough, but this was almost inedible. 

Beer - J ordered an Amber. Since I do not drink, I asked if I could have a diet soda. No Dice. So I ordered a beer and gave it to J. And just stuck with water. 

He said just for the beer's alone, it was almost worth $7.99 a piece. If we could have had a Mr. Lucky's steak with Ellis Island's Baked Potato and Green Beans, we would have been happy campers. 

Will we return to Ellis Island for eats? Maybe, but probably not to the restaurant. We might try the BBQ or Pizza joint next time. 

Now for the casino review - 

Very friendly and helpful dealers. I mentioned to J that if he wanted to learn to play craps, now was his chance. When there were other players, there were maybe 1-2 tops. The craps dealers were all very helpful on teaching him the ropes. With $80, J played easily for 2 hours. Left being down only $30. Not too shabby!!Ellis Island is an oft overlooked dining gem in Las Vegas.  While its neighborhood location and interior atmosphere could BOTH use a bump up, the food is of consistently good quality and value.  What Ellis Island doesn't offer in ambiance, it returns in quality and value of food and service.  Drive by fast and you'd never know it's there!  Except for the returning fans who stand in line all day, sometimes for as long as an hour, to get a table.  Like many Las Vegas restaurants, Ellis Island has "off the menu" specials, one of which here is the $9.99 steak dinner.  it includes a well-chosen, succulent steak cooked to order (NOT like the gristly, tough shoe leather they pass off as steak down the street at Mr. Lucky's (at the Hard Rock).  Add to that a choice of soup or salad, choice of potato, freshly prepared vegetables (I usually receive green beans sauteed in garlic & butter) AND your choice of a tall ice cold beer or root beer, BOTH brewed right there on site!  When you walk away from Ellis Island, your wallet will thank you, your stomach will thank you, your friends and family will thank you, and most of all, you'll say to yourself "WOW! that was actually a really good dining experience! I never expected that kind of quality and value from such a meager place!"  TWO THUMBS UP FOR ELLIS ISLAND!I was a tad apprehensive after booking and then reading reviews (something I NEVER do).  However, as I was going to Vegas on a weekend, and was looking at paying $175+ for less desirable hotels, $60 per night sounded pretty good, so I booked.

To my pleasant surprise, this hotel was way better than most of the reviews that I read.  Please do not get me wrong, this is not like staying at the Wynn or Caesars, but for the price and the bed comfort -- you can't go wrong!

The check-in line was a little insane when we arrived, but we were quickly escorted out of the line to the computerized check-in (seriously what a great idea!!!!).  After I swiped the wrong credit card (make sure you swipe the one you book with...oops), they quickly escorted me to the VIP area and had me checked in, in a flash.

The room was decent.  2 double beds (made for fun with 4 people, including 2 tall guys).  Walls were paper thin, which gave us some good laughs... and some annoyance between the hours of 7am-9am when our neighbors, who apparently were not out late any night....loved to slam the door, have their screaming children in the hall, etc. Not impressed by that, but that is not really the hotel's fault. 

The casino itself was fine.  Drink service was lacking (if you are going to play slots and want good drink service I would HIGHLY recommend the Quad -- the drinks were absolutely flying) and we were lucky if we had a beverage every 30 minutes or so.  The other thing that was disappointing about the gambling was that they closed the Craps tables quite early (around 2am) while there were still people playing.  Kind of strange... 

The good about the casino: $1 Blackjack, 24 hours a day.  You will have to wait in line however, but well worth the wait!  

I have never stayed at this end of the strip and I am not totally sure how I felt about it.  I felt like we had to take a cab if we wanted to go to Bally/Caesars/Flamingo etc.  But Slots A Fun and Circus Circus were fun, cheap and had good drink service. 

Overall, I would stay here again on a weekend for cheap prices.3 words: Bigass Souvenir ShopCrowded and overpriced, but still worth a quick visit.  Take a peak at all four floors, because among the piles of junk there are a few funny and innovative ideas.  Best photo op - the M&M's candy bar with its enormous row of multicolored cannisters.Drai's is becoming another club selling itself out to the dollar. No more are the days of the only reason to go to Vegas!I don't know about staying here, but I can tell you that it is a fun place to play...for a little while.  I enjoy the few remaining "vintage" casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, but sometimes the smoke can be a bit overwhelming.  These old spots definitely don't have the ventilation systems you find at big properties like Bellagio and Venetian.

There is a Denny's attached to this property for 24-hour food.  There is also an Outback Steakhouse.  The crowd is usually a younger, more rowdy group.  Lots of fun!!  There are cheap table minimums, lots of people hollering out, and decent cocktail service.  If you aren't playing and you venture up to the bar, drinks are cheap.Definitely not the best steak I've ever had.  I would say it is pretty good for the price compared to some other steak houses in Vegas.  I don't know if I just went on a bad day but the steak was nothing extraordinary.  

This place is located inside the New York New York hotel.  It's not the most upscale place (despite the dim lighting, I wouldn't say the decor was fancy/romantic) but I received an upturned nose from the hostess anyway.  Not really sure why....I was business casual even though this place is clearly casual dress code and all I did was say "hello, I have reservations for party of 2" so I can only assume that there was hint of racism in the hostess' misdemeanor.  What further ruined my experience was the table of drunk Canadian men sitting next to us that got progressively drunk as the meal continued.

 If you are looking for an upscale steak restaurant, I would go somewhere else.Very average Americanized Mexican joint. Chips and salsa are excellent (salsa is very fresh) but food is on the bland side. Service is as terrible as others have said. I went with a group of 8 on a Saturday night and most were satisfied but 2 hated the place, mostly because their food was cold. I got chicken fajitas and they were ok, comparable to a chilis or 99 restaurant unfortunately. Salsa alone would bring me back thoughThis was my first experience at Ruth's Chris and having heard many positive stories from friemds that I was full of anticipatory anxiety as a child on Christmas Eve. But I couldn't look at name tags or peek between wrapping paper!

Anyway, there were 14 of us in town for an event, and Ruth's Chris was offering a 3-course prix fixe menu for $40 or $50 depending on your entree. The complete meal offered at $39.95 includes a choice of Steak House Salad, Caesar Salad or Louisiana Seafood Gumbo, followed by a choice of Ruth's Chris signature eight-ounce Petite Filet, Stuffed Chicken Breast, Barbecued Shrimp, or the Chef's Fresh Island Fish selection.

Diners may upgrade their meal to the $49.95 entrÈe option to select from the 11-ounce Filet with Grilled Shrimp, Veal Chop with Hot and Sweet Peppers, 16-ounce Ribeye Steak, or Lobster tail with blackening spice, lemon and drizzled butter 

I, in a slight prescription drug induced fog, thought I had ordered the ribeye just like my 2 co-workers sitting across from me had. Unfortunately I received (and vaguely recall hearing myself say) the filet. My choice of appetizer and side dish was the house salad with a zesty French dressing and the garlic mashed pots.

The salad was good with a flavorful and slightly tangy. The garlic mashed was only so-so at best. They tasted a bit off and were somewhat crusty as though they had been under a heat lamp for a while. Next time, I get the mushrooms like my mother taught me! Now the steak... aside from being slightly undercooked and much closer to rare than medium rare, the flavor was AWESOME. Without a doubt the best piece of meat I've ever eaten! 

Unfortunately after the entree is where this experience took a turn for the worse... We all had finished and were sitting there waiting for the plates to be cleared, water to be refilled, dessert to be brought... aaaaannnnnndddddd.... nothing. Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. Finally one of our group had to go up to the maitre d' and complain about the lack of service.

As it turned out, or so we were told, another large group being handled by our waitress decided to ask for seperate checks once the bill arrived and then were having credit card issues on top of that, tying her up trying to get them out the door. Anyway, moving on...

The dessert course came and was a pairing of strawberries in a vanilla creme along with a chocolate mousse with whipped cream in a fluted cup made of (dark?) chocolate. Absolutely delicious!!

All in all, the experience was more positive than negative. Aside from the fact that management should've (and according to the waitress was requested by her to) handled the other difficult table, I was thoroughly impressed. Bon appetit!!There is probably better in Vegas...: When we visited Kokomo's it was very, very cold! Uncomfortably so! Based on online reviews I tried the lobster bisque, which was good but there was way too much cream. The cream overpowered the lobster and anything else in this bisque. My steak was prepared well, as was the lobster. Although the steak was good, it was not my favorite by any means. The 'special' of the night was an 8oz. filet of Kobe beef which cost $130! We stayed away from that one...
The service was good and the scenery is nice too. We were able to sit near the water and foliage. I was, however, surpised to see a few people dressed too casually, jeans, shorts(!) and t-shirts should not be allowed in a nice restaurant.Three stars, but only because I can't give them two and a half.

My boss loves this place, and since he was paying, I wasn't going to argue.  The decor is nice, and is a big change from the kitschy overdone look of lots of "Chinese" restaurants.  

Let's break down the whole experience, in order.

Valet parking is offered (free), but the lot isn't all that big, so I don't see the point.  I'm not so lazy that I can't walk the 50 yards from my car to the door.

The hostess had a look on her face that seemed to say we were interrupting her day.  She was not even remotely cordial.  I didn't catch her name.  The table was clean.

Our waitress was the highlight of the whole experience.  She was friendly, "got" my boss's weird sense of humor, and never approached the table with questions while we were chewing, though she did interrupt a conversation twice to joke with us.

We ordered egg rolls to start.  When they came out, there was oil from the fryer literally pooled on the plate under them.  When we bit into them, they were still cold on the inside.  Ugh!  Cold, greasy eggrolls!  The waitress apologized, told the manager, and we were sent out another order.  These were still really greasy, but at least they were warmer inside, though still not really hot.  The manager didn't show up at the table, which in my opinion a manager should ALWAYS show up if there's a problem with the food.

The boss ordered Mongolian Beef, and I got Sichuan Scallops.  He said his entree was what he expected, but nothing to rave about.  My scallops were very tender, and just the right level of spicy.  The servings of rice with the entrees were inadequate.

The waitress was really on top of soda refills, and was very quick with the check.  She got a nice tip (25%) but we suggested they put their cooks through a retraining course.  

Typical of what I expect from large chain "Chinese"restaurants.Calamari appetizer was quite good, pizza was not. I would probably avoid this restaurant (the Wolfgang Puck name doesn't have much cachet with me at this point).I booked my reservation directly at Westin because I noticed they had a $90 deal that included free breakfast buffet for two. What I didn't noticed when I made my reservation until when I researched the map was that it was Maxim hotel I stayed at 10 years ago. 

I stayed at Maxim 10 years ago as a high school kid following parents to go to Vegas. Since it was my second time going to Vegas back then, I remembered the experience quite clearly. It was typical Chinese middle class family going on vacation: six people staying at the same room, staying at off-strip to avoid high price, eating buffet at MGM grand, M&M was a must go because of game arcade... 

Compare to that experience, I felt fortunate this time around because only my sister was coming along to this trip. Before the trip, I was aware of the resort charge because it was already added to my bill. The resort charge includes: 2 bottles of water in the room, parking, steam room and sauna access to their spa, and swimming pool access. 

We tried to check in early but it was not available. I confirmed with the reception on what was included in the bill because a lot of the review I read on yelp stated there were a lot of hidden traps. I noticed there were a lot of information that had been varied according to the source you get the information from. 

For example: 

1) Swimming pool was stated to be under construction on the website. I didn't pack my swimming suit thus and I found out it was otherwise! People were still able to hang out by the pool!! Aside from the pool not very appealing. 

2) From the hibiscus Spa site, they stated that hotel guests need to pay to use locker room. The charge is $25. I was confused about that because I thought the resort charge Westin mandatory charged already included the usage? I was told by reception the usage is free. 

3) WORST OF ALL... We were so thirsty when we went back to the hotel at night. Sister and I saw two bottles of water on the counter next to the tv. I was lying down to test the Westin comfort bed while my sister opened one of the water bottle... I went to the bathroom and found there were two bottles of water. Just that they were not as fancy as the ones lying outside. I though Westin must be really nice and gave us two extra bottles. Then something came to my mind and I rushed outside to check on the water bottles... (check my pic) It was then I realized it was yet another trap!! It cost my sister $8 for a bottle of water that comes from Italy and hopefully a lesson she would remember for a long time. 

Compare to 10 years ago, the interior of the hotel improved a lot: no more strong statics on hotel lobby door knobs, more appealing lobby area. The bed was also very comfortable and breakfast buffet was excellent. The air conditioning in my room has no problem. However, the walls were still thin, the room corridors were also very dirty. I dislike the bath tub because the one in my room has a lot of scratches at the bottom. I probably would not choose to stay here again. If you would like the stay here, you can buy drink and snacks from the gas station store which is next to the hotel.Cheap enough hotel. It's close enough to the strip that you could walk to a lot of hotels. It's not popular enough to have taxis hanging around the hotel; please call ahead. The beds are about as comfortable as slabs of concrete though.Casino review only. Ive lived here over a yr & half and never been in here. We walked in and found the mexican restaurant La Cantina - which has menudo Fridays, Saturdays & Sundays. 
TI also has Beachfront Pizza is now called Beachfront Coffee (the coupons we have still say Pizza) and Marilyn's cafe. Theres quite a lot of places to chill but I didnt win any $ here my 1st time which always turns me off. lol. . But this is a cute casino on koval/Flamingo area near Terrible's.I met up here with a friend to chit chat over a meal. We usually meet up at Krazy Buffet but since I had a wake up call with my health I'm trying to eat better! I'm no expert so I'm just playing everything by ear. 

They had this great soup and salad deal going on for around $8.00. I had the Apple Gorgonzola & Walnut Salad with the cheese on the side though. It came with Cranberries, Candied Walnuts, Green Apples with Balsamic vinaigrette. It also came with a small Hearty Vegetable soup that wasn't salty. They were both really good ...I didn't feel disappointed in my choices because it wasn't bland or unexciting.I recently came here with my girls and had a sushi roll fest. All of the rolls ordered were very delicious and not overly "ricey". I ordered some of the nigiri and they were fresh as well but the item on the menu that brought it home was the yellowtail collar. It was delicious! Would come here again for some girls night out before hitting the clubs.was visiting town and my cousin brought us in here as he is a local.
shared a few different dips that were all very solid.
for my meal i had the eggplant pita which i enjoyed but would have preferred the eggplant warmed instead of cold.  it is a HUGE sandwich.  the fries on the side were delicious with the heavy seasoning and dipping sauce.  all the portions were just so big, definitely a good bang for your buck.  i tried a little of the spanikopita from my bros plate and i can say i was not happy it had coconut in it, that's just weird.  the rice and veggies his came with def rivaled my fries.
would give it a go next time in town and looking for a great, cost-effective meal!Came here after the movies and it was just like my rating which was ok....

We didn't a whole lot of sushi that night but we had two apps, a salad and an entree.  The apps were pretty good along with the salad, but that beef cooked hibachi style was a little weird.  I know the taste of hibachi being raised in hawaii, but that tasted like it was put in the oven, cooked well done, and rubbery.  

Service wise it was ok, we went in pretty late so we tried to make haste, but they were still pretty friendly.I am a huge fan of C&A, but I have to give it three stars for one major reason--time.  If you are looking to have great  times without dedicating your entire evening to the cause (well, at one place at least!), Crown & Anchor is not for you.  It WILL take you two hours to get three rounds of drinks on a good night.  Err, while I'm at it, I may as well mention parking as well.  I have only lucked out twice with parking at this place, and that was only because I pulled up as someone was pulling out.  On several occasions, my friends and I have parked at Metro across the street or Sherman-Williams and walked over.  Their parking lot is kind of hazardous, anyway.  It's very tight and really difficult to maneuver around in if you get stuck in a sticky place.

But now that I got THAT out of the way (I'm sorry C&A, for I do love you so!), let's get to the goodies.  My friends and I love this place for every reason you could love a pub.  Crown is super cozy and completely raucous at the same time!  When you walk in, you will see people from all walks: older groups enjoy it, the UNLV crowd is pretty big, business people head there after work, and clubbers hit it up for the predancetimebuzz.

Some one mentioned the old wood, and wax, and it takes me back to my Nana Wendy's house.  I sit down and look at the menu and see my family's traditional "home-cooked" foods--shepherd's pie, bangers and hash, scotch eggs, cod and chips, curries--for even though I'm from the South, my father and his family are British!

The imported beers list gives a nice sample of the many great UK (and I mean all the countries involved, not just GB) beers, with plenty on tap.  If you're feeling adventurous, the bartender and *some* of the wait staff are very knowledgeable and will happily recommend something to quench what you're thirstin' fer.  

If sitting around outside with a smoke, a beer, and a group of friends at a great pub isn't enough excitement for you, inside they have darts, video poker, and several televisions for your pubbing pleasure.  They also frequently host events aimed at the UNLV crowd, like the British Comedy bash, music, and more.  Hello AbFab costume!!Update on Buffalo Exchange. For the first time I went to BE to sell clothes a few days ago. I had some items that were just not being worn and felt as though I could get a few bucks for them. 

First off, don't take your clothes here unless they are really new or totally out-dated (as in vintage...). They won't take anything else. They are incredibly picky. Forget about trying to sell them anything preppy, classic, romantic, or very nice business. I guess they just don't take that stuff because their clientele doesn't buy it. Or, as I was told "These styles don't move". Your best bet is with boho and very trendy "right now" clothes. I find it kind of funny that they won't sell much else because most teenagers (who buy that kind of stuff) would refuse to step foot in BE. Okay, that's a bit of an over-reaching statement, but you get where I am getting at, right?

I also dislike how they have expanded so much of their store to men's wear as well. I'm not against men's wear, but I just didn't think it warranted that much space. 

Also to note, although they won't take "nicer" clothing (as in higher-up fancy labels, which my clothes were) they did jump on my never-used Coach wristlet, yet only wanted to offer me $6 for it! HA HA HA. Ya right. I'll go sell it on ebay for way more than that.

Overall I think they are WAY too picky and the quality of this establishment has gone down since I've been here last. Maybe it's just that I'm getting older and my style is changing, who knows. Either way, I still have to bring down my original review of 5 stars to 3. This place is only okay. I think I would rather visit a Patty's Closet.Let's be honest here. This station has undergone a drastic shift from JAZZ to jazz-lite. And it isn't an improvement over what they've been playing for the last couple of years.

They've also unfunded many of the morning shows that were fun and adventurous, or even offbeat. Now it seems like a one hour loop tape. 

A break here. They are a nice complement to the Classical stations weekend programming. They do shine here. Hawaiian, Bluegrass, Reggae, Blues. It's all good. But the Lyon's Den is moot and hard to take seriously.

Back to days...

Now they run this jazz/soul lightweight stuff that doesn't offer as much to true J A Z Z fans. This is like having a smoothie instead of a snifter of the hard stuff. Not much bebop nor hard bop. Not as much Afro-cuban stuff nor early jazz pioneers.

Where has the triumvirate of Miles, Monk, And Mingus gone?! Now we are chockablock with Boney James and his ilk. 

Daring? no. Nostalgic? hardly. Decent? barely.I stumbled across this place last month as I rushed around E Flamingo trying to find a place to fix the damage done to my nails by T-Nails. I ran into Nails Expo where three older ladies were sitting on the couch and were all very nice! They could obviously see how traumatized I was! ;o) lol. . . .So they fixed my one nail and re-did the rest, for the cost of only the one nail and they made me promise I would come back, so I did.

Today I got a full-set of acrylics and as Crystalia mentioned, not too much conversation, but I too would much rather have good nails than conversation. Lisa, who did my nails, did a great job and for a great price, she took her time filing, buffing and painting. 

I also noticed they have a deluxe pedicure with a 30 minute foot massage for only $40! I am so going back. . . .The marinated chicken was really good, but the carne (diezmillo), was really fatty in my opinion. Good marinade, and same flavor, as the west side location, which we've frequented for years, but the quality of the meat was definitely on the lower side.

They didn't seem to have as much of a selection of pastries, meats or produce at this location. Maybe it's due to only having been there once but I do prefer our tried and true location on Decatur, as compared to this one.

However, I will be going back in the future and hope to improve on my first impression.Anyone who's read my reviews of Mexican restaurants knows that I judge a Mexican restaurant, first, by how they make Chile Relleno... AND then anything else they might have.

My first impression of Lindo Michoacan was that this restaurant does not take Chile Relleno seriously, as the establishment serves it only as an ala-carte item or as an item included within their combination dishes. There are NO entrees with Chile Relleno by itself.... the waiter recommended that I order a couple of Chile Rellenos and just make my own entree... He just does not see the difference!

Chips & Salsa - Large crispy and warm tortilla ccrn chips. Very tasty and appetizing Bean Dip and a Red Chili Salsa concoction. FYI: my kids told me to take it easy on the Chips and Salsa during Lunch, as Lindo Michoacan charges customers at Lunch for extra Chips and Salsa! WTF!!!!

Chili Relleno - Abover average size Chile, but immersed in a very watery, very watery sauce. Relleno disintegrated while it was just sitting there! Ttalking to my Hispanic friends in California, I found out that Relleno are a very difficult item to make...  but Rellenos are also a staple of any Hispanic restaurant.

Camarones Ranchero - Immersed in a watery Ranchero sauce that was reminiscent of the Chile Relleno sauce.... coulda been the same sauce! For $16 the pricing is just way too much money for the below average preparation. There is NOTHING innovative about the recipe for this Shrimp in Ranchero Sauce entree that would justify the high price! Lindo Michoacan should apologize to every customer before seating them on their high prices and below average quality. 

Tortillas - Hand-made, home-made flour tortillas.  Besides the Chips and Salsa, the best part of the Lindo Michoacan experience.

I'll temper my two star rating with my kids' above average ratings. They love this Mexican restaurant for some reason. The positives of the home-made Tortillas and the Chips & Salsa does not offset the negatives of watery sauces that smother the Chile Relleno and Camarones Ranchero compounded by the very high prices and below-average service.Prices are not any better than most neighborhood grocery stores and that's really disappointing.

I like the people that work here. In fact, I think that's the only reason I go back. The neighborhood reminds me of ultra-high-density New York City or Pittsburgh, there are no-line-lot (which means different homes share one or more common walls) high density gated communities with street names like "Long Island Street" and the like nearby, and those hideous project-ghetto neo-ugly high rise buildings too. And South Point is right down the street. 

Clearly, this is one of Mr. Lee's most convenient locations, and priced accordingly. Props to Mr. Lee on motivating his employees. Even with a store full of people (usually on Friday night after 5pm and before 7pm), these employees are rock-and-roll motivated!

A little difficult to park, but not bad.I've been a loyal customer to House of Smokes for years and recently, I've started to feel like there service has become extremely lackluster. 

Case in point; I called them about two months ago asking a couple questions about the electronic cigarette I had purchased from them and the employee I spoke to would just answer "I don't know" to seemingly every single question I asked on the matter, not "hang on lemme find out for you" or "let me get someone who can answer your questions". It seemed as if me calling was interrupting him and that my previous sale or future sales weren't  really that important.

Other than that, I think the store has a great selection of product albeit slightly more expensive than other places for some of the product. and the atmosphere is extremely accommodating 

The only other problem I have is their policy of not giving prices over the phone. I understand that they don't want to fall prey to people trying to get them to price match on items that are online in the digital age we live in and I don't have a problem with that. But they don't have an actual website to get any information from and the last time I checked, their hours were listed wrong online, so it makes it extremely hard to be able to make it down there a lot of the time to check out said prices.Decent food, good drinks, and good service. Nice atmosphere for a late night snack and drinkBy far the LAZIEST, most unhelpful front desk staff imaginable. I was ignored when I walked in since they were busy chatting, then told to sign in. I signed in at 2:09 and was told they'd tell Mike I was here. I had already spoken to him so he was expecting me. 20 minutes later I approached the desk to ask how much longer he would be. The girl says, "I emailed him but he hasn't written back." REALLY?? Get off your butt and go tell him OR god forbid you pick up a phone and tell him! Mike came out and had no idea I was sitting there.  Mike, the case manager is great. Apologized, was thorough with our meeting and incredibly helpful. And I love the office decor.The painted desert golf club is nothing like I imagined it to be from the name.
I expected this golf club to be out north of Las Vegas, near the Piute Counrty club - in the desert.
Even the pictures on their website are a bit deceiving.
This course winds through the painted desert suburb of Vegas.
It is a nice course, a bit narrow at times, but there are touches of the desert to be found on most every hole.
It is one of the shorter courses in Las Vegas.
It is gentle on the scorecard for the higher handicap players.
..... unless you hit the ball into the houses bordering the course.....
It is also a bit gentle on the wallet ... they have some good rates for afternoon tee times.
There is water on most of the par threes, making them scenic as well as challenging.
A nice place to play - to feel  good about your game.
It is a bit of a drive out highway 95.....
but your game will come out of here aliveVery tasty comfort foods. I love their chicken chili and their milkshakes/malts. I had a great experience with the brunch on Christmas eve morning.  We have also ordered cakes here and they are always beautiful and tasty. They are very very slow.I am a recent relocate and this was my first visit to Durant's.

The backdoor entrance is fun and the interior is attractive and relaxing.  I really liked the leather seating.

They were very patient and accommodating to my grandparents who are in their 80s.  My grandma sent her entrée back and they removed it from our bill.

Since it was my birthday, they paid for our dessert, too.

We ordered sliders as an appetizer.  They were good and reminded us of the cheap, grilled onion burgers we get at the fair back home.

My Washington Apple martini was also good.  No complaints there.

However, my shrimp were stinky, overcooked and over-seasoned.  That means that they served me old seafood.  Strike one.

I had the 8oz filet mignon steak, which was around $40.  It was average and slightly over-seasoned as well.  Strike two.

My stuffed baked potato was huge and incredibly filling!  Potatoes are pretty cheap to buy and cook.  I wish a little more imagination and flair went into the preparation of their potatoes.

In sum, Durant's is on the very edge of categorically good food for a comparable price.  It is my assumption that you could pay a few dollars more at another establishment and be served much better fare.

As it is, Durant's is at the unfortunate level of being simply average, while charging exorbitant prices for the experience and the charm.

Though, I still find it difficult to imagine being served a subpar entrée for over $60, it still doesn't change the fact that this is what I experienced.

Yes, it is overrated, but still quite enjoyable and fun.  

Durant's receives 3 stars for their drinks, their desserts, and their commitment to excellent customer service.Home of the $200 Torta!

O.k., not really.  But I got your attention, didn't I?

While in Phoenix for the holidays I wanted to take my in-laws out to a traditional Mexican meal.  Such is Life has apparently closed, and it was always my staple when I wanted to take friends and relatives to an "accessible" meal that wasn't Macayo's, Garcia's or Carlos O'Briens (for the record, none of these place is Mexican...Tex-Mex, yes, and I love them all for that, but it's not the same and you know it).

So while searching for an authentic experience that didn't entail a day trip to visit La Roca in Nogales, I came across this little gem in Central Phoenix  What grabbed me on the menu was the entire section of tortas.  Now THIS is my kind of place!

To open we had guacamole (of course), and it was really flat.  There was no serrano, and I'm not sure if there was any jalepeño.  If I'd stopped here, they would get 1 star.  But they stayed in the game by bringing us two orders of Lobster Quesadillas.  This dish is creative, decadent and decidedly Mexican.  Bravo!

Since the in-laws had never experienced the majesty that is the torta, I thought we'd order four and split them so everyone could gain as much as exposure as possible.  We did the following:

Cochinita Pibil:  According to Robert Rodriguez, this is Johnny Depp's favorite ;).  Barrio Café's take on this venerable Central Mexican staple is solid, and I would definitely order it again.

Pollo y Jaiba: Wow!  A grilled chicken breast topped with lump crab meat, avocado, Oaxaca cheese and Hollandaise!  Absolutely classic, and exactly what I was hoping to share when I chose this restaurant.

del Barrio:  Essentialy a roasted Chile Relleno.  My least favorite, and yet it was just far enough outside the box so as to present a new experience while still maintining a sense of familiarity.

de Filetito: The belle of the ball.  This one is a sliced filet mignon, topped with chorizo, blue cheese & chipotle sauce.  Good God, this was amazing.  My father-in-law ate most of my quarter, so I only got 2 bites.  But these two bites, the last of my meal, were the best!

The tequila and beer selections were accommodating without being daunting (no one really needs a choice of 200 different tequilas, do they?).  The shortcomings are in the way of things totally unrelated to the food.  The service was dismissive and the ambiance was like the guacamole (flat, remember).  I'd really like to give them 4 stars, and as I'm looking forward to returning soon, they may just earn that 4th star in a follow-up.It's pretty good but a little pricey for what you get..the tacos are really small!  Good flavor..I had carne asada tacos..u get 4 small tacos..very tasteful but tiny..finished dish in like 2 minutes!  The Jamaica Margarita was pretty good but also small..it had Gran Mariner in it which was a nice kick! ($13)..another thing is that the server barely payed attention to us and was only looking after the larger tables.This place is definitely hit or miss and it's not for the faint of heart. If you come, bring some hand sanitizer and tell your husband to bring a book. Because you will dig through bins of stuff and try on shoes that are more Well-worn than you'd see in any other store. They're not supposed to be used technically but some have definitely been returned according to nordstrom's regular and generous return policy I.e. sole scuffed, Leather scuffed, insides sweated in a bit. Gross right? All that said you can find good things here if you look hard and know your name brands. I find that sometimes the people who work here dont know what they're tagging and just give it a low price tag unwittingly. I found Joe's jean leggings on the active workout rack for $4.95 originally $80. And if you're willing to get something and show it some TLC then you'll be fine. Otherwise I'd say go to Nordstrom rack, pay the extra dollars for a stress-free shopping experience.I came here after spending a month in Mexico. I'm pretty sure that any restaurant (especially one bragging about George W.'s trip there) could even come close to even a taco stand south of the border.

However, after a few weak-ish margaritas were in me (the pitchers are great, but have a lot of ice, and are kind of spendy), I didn't mind the noise or the extremely cramped quarters (I don't even know how the waiters are able to serve having to constantly zig-zag between people).

The portions are generous for the price, but it's obviously more Tex-Mex than the real thing.There are really only 3 reasons to go to a restaurant; food, value, and atmosphere.  Sapporo kills it on one of them.  The other two...eh.  

Finding a trendy, overpriced, mediocre sushi place in Scottsdale is about as difficult as finding cacti.  And I won't sugarcoat the fact that that is what Sapporo is.  

The food was good.  We tried out the lobster dumplings, some sashimi, and various sushi rolls.  Nothing was stunning or overly memorable about the meal except for the fact that my plate had dried rice stuck to it from the dishwasher.  

The value was confusing.  Everything was on happy hour for their summer long happy hour pricing but nothing seemed like a good deal.  How is $8 for a sushi roll happy hour pricing?  When it's $9 normally.  Come on...if you're running a special, make it special.  Good thing there was $5.75 beer on special too.  That's my way of saying "your value sucks."     

Since it's clear the inflated pricing doesn't go to the kitchen for ingredients or training, they do heavily invest in decor and atmosphere.  Overall it is a very cool layout with a good crowd, strong energy, but not loud to the point where you can't have a conversation.  Very well done in this regard.

Overall, I'll go back for a drink or a group happy hour if in the neighborhood due to the scene but I doubt I'd come back just for the grub.  NOW what will I ever do for sushi!?!Decent hotel. It's located on the complete end of the strip, so if you want to visit some of the hotels like Mandalay Bay or Luxor, it's a little bit of a drive. The attractions are good, but if you already have a room, you still have to pay to get to the top of the tower. The rooms are nice, but you have to pay for a view. The beds are ridiculously confortable though.Visited on my recent trip to Vegas.  They have a great Northern Larb and Chicken soup with glass noodles.  I was sharing with someone that doesn't eat spicy, so that limited me off of the Northern cuisine.  Would definitely try again.  I felt the service was decent.  The servers seemed stretched out over large areas...maybe because it was on a Sunday??Service was was good but slow.
Food was good but the entree (Filet Mignon) I was told could only be prepared Medium after asking for Med Well. 
Salad arrived after 40 min. 
My entree arrived about 40 min later and my steak was medium rare at best and barely warm. No sign of a waiter to send back for 15 min. 
It's not hard to cook a steak but they cant get it done.Visited during the weekend of 5/9/08 - 5/10/08.

I had heard seating was tough here, and it is. But both times I visited, I was able to get a seat at the bar with no wait (once for a party of two then again for a party of four).

The bartenders are very friendly and personable. I didn't need their beer expertise to decide what to drink, but I saw them helping some craft newbies decide on a brew.

The draft selection is solid and is probably the best thing they have to offer. Be warned that pints are pricey, though.

Food is, to put it mildly, seriously overpriced. Burgers can easily run over $20.00 without much effort. If they were truly $20.00 burgers, this would be acceptable. But I feel these burgers and sides (brought in frozen or prepackaged, no less) are worth perhaps half to two thirds what is being charged. You are definitely paying for the scene.

Speaking of scene... it is crowded with youngish, good looking people. Saw lots of beer being consumed, but also saw a good amount of other beverages. I don't think the craft beer list is the main attraction for most of the diners.

Some places have deserved reps for great burgers (Father's Office and Lucky Devil's in L.A., for instance), but this place is getting by on its inexplicable "hot" status. Don't get me wrong, the food is good. But it's not buzz worthy.

I don't think I'll be going back here again unless it's to grab a pint on the way to eat somewhere else.I was hesitant to even give this place 3 stars, I only did because they had a great beer selection. 

$90 for lunch with 2 burgers, 1 fry and 3 beers. Maybe some of the worst money I've ever spent. The burgers were just ok, nothing spectacular. My boyfriend's Kobe Beef burger had chunks of tendons or something in it. The bartenders were attentive but not personable. 

I wouldn't return, or suggest this place to anyone. 

BLT Burger was so much better, just a few hotels down the strip.My 200th review! Wow, who knew I ate out so much!! For #200 I have chosen Mesa Grill. I am torn on giving 4 stars...but I don't want to give 3 either...let's say 3 1/2 stars for Mesa. 

The service was definitely 5 stars. We had an awesome, attentive, friendly, sweet waiter who really did an awesome job. The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. The table was large and the seating was comfortable. 

When it comes to the food though...I just wasn't that impressed :( I had really high hopes for Mesa...I have heard so many people tell me how much they love it and how it will be some of the best food I will ever eat. I beg to differ.

Let me break it down, we had a LOT of food, so I feel like me giving 3 stars for food is justified:

Appetizers - Goat Cheese "Queso Fundido", Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Corn Tamale, Blue Corn Pancake with Duck, Yucatan Chicken Tacos. 

We ordered four appetizers for five people. That should be enough, right? Wrong. These appetizers are tiny. And expensive for the portion you receive! The total for just the appetizers was $60. Yes, 6-0 dollars. One appetizer was barely enough for two people. And let me state for the record, I have no problem throwing down money for good food, but I thought it was absolutely ridiculous the amount charged for tiny little bites of food.

But how did it taste, you ask? Okay. The cheese dip was awesome. I will give Mr. Flay that - he can make a mean cheese dip. But, if you didn't eat it fast enough, it hardened. So, eat quickly when you order the queso! The shrimp tamale was also pretty good. The shrimp were large and juicy, the corn filling was nice and flavorful, which a yummy cilantro cream sauce. The blue pancake with duck was alright...I wouldn't eat it again. It was shredded duck in a super rich BBQ sauce, just okay. The chicken tacos were served with red onions and "chile BBQ sauce" that tasted just like Thai food...pad thai to be exact. 

Sides - Glazed Baby Carrots with brown sugar, Roasted Corn with smoked chile's and Cotija cheese, Sautéed Spinach, Sweet Potato Tamale with Pecan Butter.

I tried all of these sides. This place is like Ruth's Chris where you order your meat, and everything else on the side, your entree doesn't come with anything.

The baby carrots had a nice flavor, but they were a little undercooked for my taste. I prefer softer carrots. The sweet potato tamale with pecan butter - sounds awesome right? Sounds sweet and delicious, right? Well, it tastes like Masa. The sautéed spinach was literally just that. Spinach. Now, I love spinach, and I can eat it plain or dressed up, but when I pay $8 for spinach, I would expect some garlic, or salt...or anything...nope. This was seriously cooked spinach with no other flavors. 

The Roasted Corn was the star of the sides. It was absolutely delicious. The corn kernels were crisp and fresh, served in an awesome creamy, cheesy sauce that was spicy, but not too overpowering. Just awesome. 

Entrees - Coffee Rubbed Filet MIgnon, Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin.

Three of us had the filet, the other two had the pork. Since I can't eat pork, I don't want to say much about it, but I will say BF said it was good, but not the best ever. Maybe if he ever gets on the ball and starts Yelping again, he can tell you about it himself.

The filet...very large cut of meat, too much to finish. It was soft, it was coffee rubbed, it didn't really taste like anything. The coffee rub was more of a burnt crust. I got a hint of coffee, but mostly I just tasted burn. 

It was served on some mushroom, ancho chile sauce. The mushrooms were very good. Spicy and caramelized. I loved the sauce...but the filet? I would rather go to Ruth's Chris. honestly.

After dinner our friends ordered dessert and coffee. I tried the coffee, good flavor. I took a bite of their Pineapple Buttermilk Upside Down Cake - it was very good, rich, sweet, served with a caramelized rum sauce. 

Overall, this place was just alright. There were a few things that hit high notes with me, but they were appetizers and sides, and I don't think I would come back just for those items. The majority of the food was just okay, not amazing, not the best I have ever had. 

I think I will just stick to making my Bobby Flay recipes at home, they taste better and they are cheaper!squash curry = orgasm

that is all.Please god, show up at least semi buzzed so you are distracted by the filth that is the Essen Haus.  Then order up a boot of beer for you and your friends.  Skip the food in general, but the soft pretzels will do in a pinch if the copious amounts of beer have endangered your stomach.

the good:  their excellent selection of German beer, boots of beer and kitschy polka bands
the bad: everything else, including the kitschy polka bandsBoots, polka dance, and free popcorn... Why not?

Essen Haus is a good place to hang out and feel young again. If you're hungry and need a little something in your stomach before you crank up the volume, the brats they serve come in handy.I love this place at 4am. Yep after bar. The food is what you think of beans, rice, lettuce, cheese and mystery meat, mix it different ways and call it what you will. It is rot gut Mexican but it is awesome late at night. After spending a lot of time in the SW and in parts of Mexico and South America there is nowhere in Madison that get Latino or TexMex cooking right.People complain about the wait, but a half hour, to me, isn't much of a wait.
One thing I love about Oregano's is that they will make substitutions.  They have an awesome pasta dish with olives and sun-dried tomatoes.  It comes with feta, but I always have them substitute goat cheese.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm yumy!
I have no idea what a "Pazookie" is!
The outdoor patio in back is cute to eat at, too.  I love going to Oregano's with my whole familyI got a great deal on a room, and took a family vacation there for a last minute summer holiday.

Had kids in tow, 15, 11 and 9. Normally, I wouldn't take kids to Vegas, but I heard this place had a movie theater, arcade and bowling alley inside of it so I though it would work.

We were there on a Sunday - Tuesday and it was pretty crowded, the buffet line was huge at 9am. Luckily we got there before 8:30am and had no wait. It was 7.99 and pretty good. The best thing on it was the scrambled eggs, bacon, and apple dumplings. Coffee was free and good too.

We did see a movie, whcih was 6.00 b4 6pm, not bad, plus I had a coupon for a free popcorn. The arcade was fun, the kids liked that and won some stuff. The pool was just OK, its large, has plenty of chairs, but the water was cloudy --not the cleanest. The drinks were 7.50; I had a pina colada and it tasted weird--like melted plastic or something chemically. The bartender was dour but at least the wait was short. There was free ice water and generous towels available.

Believe it or not, the gift shop was pretty good. They had snacks, drinks, not-bad priced nicknaks and even swimming trunks for only 19.99.

The room was clean, the beds and pillows were ok...but the TV was fuzzy (they said they don't have HDTV "yet") The bathroom is crazy--there is only one door, a slider, and it didnlt close all the way, or lock. We called room maintenance and they came right over and tried to fix it, but couldn't make it lock. Beware if you are planning on sharing a room. The a/c was very very loud.

I played the penny slots and some 25 cent video poker. $20.00 lasted me all 2 days. As you can see, I am not much of a gambler. Not too many bells and whistles around me, though. Can't say for sure if this is a "lucky" casino or not. Workers seemd nice on the whole.

The Orleans has a free shuttle to the strip that runs until 12:30am. We took it one night and it drops you off right in front of Bill's, across from Paris and Caesars.  Once inside the sanctuary of a casino, the prices of food, drink and souvenirs is astoundingly high in most places. We spent 37.00 on 4 gelatos and a pack of macarons at Payard in Caesar's Palace one night.

 It was exhausting trying to see all the sights and fighting crowds, but I am glad we pushed through. The kids were so tired afterwards though. The shuttle service picked up every 10 minutes or so, and boy was I glad seeing it pull up when we were ready to leave the Strip.

I hadn't been to Vegas for 10 years. It has changed alot, much of it not for the better, IMHO.  I actually was grateful this hotel was off the strip. The Strip is unbelievably crowded with tourists, bums, drunks, and very dirty costumed "characters" that badger you to take a picture with them for a fee. (I would never let my kid next to one of those-ick!) 

All in all, if you don't mind being way off the strip (don't believe the map on the website; Orleans is NOT located right next to New York New York! Its way east on Tropicana.) this is a good place to stay for free comp, or the 25.99 deal I got.you know how the saying goes "what happens in Vegas...goes on Yelp."

Palms is a very average hotel. Not the best, and not the worst.

I hate that it's so far from the actual strip so you don't really get the whole Vegas experience. This is my second time staying at the hotel, and I still had a great time. C'mon...its Vegas!!Beautiful hotel, nice accommodations, excellent service, but with some annoying drawbacks.

The rooms are great.  Beds and chairs are comfy, and there's twice-daily housekeeping.  The staff are especially friendly and helpful.

Every room has a safe, which is nice.  However, our room (and supposedly most of them) had a 22" CRT television.  It's not a big deal, but what's up with that?

The big, big drawback is the wifi.  In an era where McDonald's gives you free wifi. Bellagio charges $15 for 24 hours of wireless access.  Really?  There's not even a 3 days for $25 or such.  I had to get online to do some work, so I didn't have much choice.  My 24 hours ended, and I wasn't going to pay again for the few hours more that I would use before leaving.

Another annoyance is the unapologetic gouging in the sundries shops.  Does this really need to be a cost center?  $4 for a liter of Dasani?  I might have gambled in the time I spent walking over to the ABC store across the street.

All in all, Bellagio is an excellent destination.  I'll happily upgrade my review to five stars if they make just these two changes:

- provide free (or just some nominal charge) wifi
- upgrade the televisionsThis hotel confused me a bit...  I chose this place over others because I love the casino.  The decor and overall scene is great, the place has been kept up relatively well.

First off, we pulled up to the valet and there was no one working, I stopped my car got out and walked around looking for someone to take my car.  I looked around and couldn't find anyone so I figured screw it, I'll self park, it's not far.  As we drove out of the valet area there was at least 40 people waiting for their cars.

We park and walk to registration.  There wasn't a large line by any means, maybe 6 people in front of us and 4 employees working the counter.  It took almost 30 minutes to make our way to the counter, once there the room reserved was no longer available so the guy upgraded us.  We originally reserved a Park Ave room which is just above the standard room, the clerk told us he put us in the Broadway room which was a level up from that.  All was fine and dandy until we got to our 'room?'.  Ever been on an Indian reservation?  Well me either until I got to my room.  The indian theme was pretty tacky but the purple pleather chair with tiger stipe seat cushion really pushed made it incredible awful.  The room was big enough for an after party but I mean even Motel 6's have coffee makers in the rooms...

I can say for a room that runs $400 for a Friday and Saturday it's definitely, DEFINITELY not worth it.  We got a good rate, that's the only thing I can say I came away with from this stay.Compared to the nicer hotels on the strip this one has earned itself 3 stars. But as far as getting what you pay for, NYNY isn't bad. The room and bathroom were clean and the beds were comfortable. There just isn't much extra floor space in the rooms (in rooms with two double beds), few tv channels, and static on some channels that were available. 

The food options seem good although I didn't try any and there is a lot to do as far as slots and casino activities. The pool was small and there isn't much going on there. There is no coffee, fridge, or minibar in the rooms. For a cheap trip I would stay here again.My husband and I just spent the weekend there. This was Mexican Independence Weekend in Vegas and there were a lot of good performers, shows and of course, the boxing match. We are from California and we decided to stay at the Paris as it is centrally located across from Bellagio and a short walk to Caesars. The room we stayed was a  suite in room 729P. It was a great big room--I felt like it was a small apartment. It was comfortable and came with the bare necessities. That is just it--the bare necessities. For the price we paid, it would have been nice to have some robes like many high end hotels offer and a makeup mirror. I was excited to have a vanity,  but the lighting was poor and so I didn't use it. The  safe was on the shelf in the closet and was so high that you cant see inside of it. Not very smart to put a safe so high--what if I was very short person? What if I was elderly and couldnt reach?  I also hate having a sink in my bedroom, it makes me feel like I am staying in a motel rather than a nice hotel. I decided I don't like Parisian decor-- flowery and outdated. We loved the Mon Amie Gabi Steakhouse--highly recommend it. But honestly, the drinks in the casino are watered down --I guess I shouldn't expect a good drink if I am getting it for free while I am gambling. But even at the bar, they didn't have a good bottle of tequila. If you think silver Patron is a good tequila, you don't know tequila. No anejos--not a complete  bar. We went over to Caesars and they did have good tequila--come on, not everyone drinks vodka and gin. But to be fair, the service was very good and always has been when we go to the bar at kiosk.   The workers are friendly.   The Fitness room was well equipped and had water and fresh fruit. Why we have to pay a resort fee to use it-- I don't know. They allowed one device for free WiFI--really, most people have their own device--Get with the 21st Century digital community!    Paris is expensive for what you get.  All in all, stay at the Paris if you want the basics, but high end, not really. It's comfortable and clean.So my husband and I decided to get away for the weekend and this was an affordable place to stay on the strip. 
The rooms are clean and decent no roaches or anything so that is a plus. 
When compared to the other places in Vegas like Caesars, Venetian, Wynn this place sucks but one can take a cab or walk to these places.  
My husband and I love to eat when we go on vacation and the buffet was gross. Good thing it was free because I would not pay 20 bucks for that piece of crap. 
Make sure to use the Valet if you are driving since there is no self park. 
Decent place to stay at Vegas but not the best.I booked a room here the day they had that lovely rooftop fire that didn't set off some of the fire alarms... of course, I'm no idiot, I wasn't aware of the fire until after I booked on expedia. But why was there no discount?? A hotel where the alarms in the rooms and halls don't go off when there's a fire going on, worries me. Needless to say, I'm assuming they fixed the problem... or so I hope.

The inside of the hotel and casino are very nice, pretty standard flashy looking for the hotels on the upper end of the hotels on the Strip. Clean, polished floors that I can see my reflection in, gaudy-looking huge chandeliers.... and some odd smell that I couldn't figure out until the last day. Cheap soap. Checking in and out was very easy, but I was expecting more out of the rooms. Not that the rooms were bad or anything, they just weren't really above average. As my boyfriend pointed out, it seemed about the same as the rooms at Flamingo. Their casino never seems as busy or crowded as the others on the strip, which could be a good or bad thing. Overall, my stay was just average here. Like I said, for the price of the room, I was expecting more.The good:
1.  Renovated room
2.  Awesome bed
3.  Central location on the strip
4.  Good pool.
5.  Gambling is decent with plenty of $10-15 blackjack tables.


The bad:
1.  Weak water pressure in shower
2.  Poorly draining tub
3.  Slow wi-fi
4.  Bad buffetcame here with a group of 16 for the fiance's 30th birthday weekend -- 14 adults plus 2 little kiddos (ages 4 and 6).  the service was outstanding!!!  our group of 16 had to be split into 2 circular tables next to each other which made it really difficult to socialize w/each other.  however i really really appreciated how attentive the waiters were, and they treated my little nephews really well too.  i was pleasantly surprised when they offered the boys kids meals consisting of grilled cheese sandwiches and french fries :)

now...for the food review.  first off i must clarify, i do not eat beef so my review is for the lamb chop.  lamb is usually a gamble for me because i only like it if its cooked right and does not smell lamb-ey.  my lamb chop was ehhhh.  the meat portion was HUGE, but only the outside was tasty.  the entire inside of my meal was verrrrry gamey -- which i do not like.  we ordered the creamed spinach, potatoes, and mushrooms to share.  they tasted like --- creamed spinach, potatoes, and mushrooms.  really nothing special.  everyone else seemed to enjoy their steaks, but if there's a next time maybe i'll try the pork chop instead.Considering the price and prestige of the hotel, I was a little disappointed of my stay here. 

This is one of the hugest hotels I have ever stayed. The ground floor level and lobby is huge. Of course, there are casinos there for the folks that like to get their gambling on. The food court was a little unimpressive. It has a Nathan's, a McDonalds, and  a few other places that I can't remember off the top of my head. Plenty of attractions and there are even some clothing stores to get a little shopping on. There are a couple of studios there where you can screen TV shows. There is a place there called CSI: The Experience but I haven't had the opportunity to see what it is like. There are at least a dozen bars located in the hotel itself. The Centrifuge Bar is where I dranked and the drinks were mixed just right. The prices wasn't too bad there either.

The rooms were okay, if slightly dated. They still have CRT television sets like it's still the 1990s. The rooms were well-ventilated and the beds were comfortable albeit a little stiff. The bathrooms were nice and clean, although it did take a while for the water in the shower to warm up, even at the full hot setting. And there is no free internet nor Wi-Fi in the rooms; you'll have to pay extra.

All in all I may return to this hotel when I come back to Las Vegas next year. The good outweigh the bad overall.Stayed here while attending the ACM's. Overall it's a nice hotel ,it's on the more southern end of the Las Vegas strip sitting across from New York New York. The one thing I do not like is how the overall hotel is laid out concerning the casino floor and generally finding your way around. Now, I realize they do this on purpose but yet this hotel seems more confusing than most in its general layout. All of the rooms were fairly up-to-date and no major issues did order room service they quoted an hour in delivered within that hour. The pool looked like the place to be although from your room it's a hike. To give you a sense of how big the property is, I believe I counted four Starbucks within the property itself. They were having quite a bit of construction and some of the restaurants that you would normally eat at were closed. We did eat in a couple their specialty restaurants and those will be covered in a separate Yelp. Overall would I stay here again? If it's up to me and I'm booking the room, the answer would be no. I much prefer Caesar's Palace or Mandalay Bay.I'm truly 50/50 on my experience at the MGM so let me break it down for you.

Things that I liked:

- Super friendly staff. Every morning, there would be several people in the hallway and each would greet us with a "Hello/Good morning/Have a nice day!" Love it!

- Great location. I walked everywhere. Right across from New York, New York. A 10 minute walk to Planet Hollywood. Definitely manageable.

Things I'm on the fence about:

- The pool. It's a huge, sprawling complex but it gets crowded very early (like by 11 AM) and it's difficult to find a pool chair. Everyone seems to just lay their towel down and walk away. Very frustrating! The lazy river was nice and quite entertaining at 5 PM with all the drunk guys trying to hit on us while not being able to talk or walk. :)

- The buffet. The food was good and there was a nice selection but the dinner buffet is severely overpriced at $36/person. You can see my buffet review for more info.

Things I disliked:

- The resort fee. It's very annoying to have to pay $25/day for things that I largely didn't use. Gym? Ha! Not in Vegas. Paper? Does anyone read the newspaper anymore? And this is coming from a journalism graduate. The only amenity included in the resort fee that I used was the internet and there's no way that should cost $25/day when I pay a total of $45/month at home. Ridiculous!

- Drink prices at the pool. $22 for a pina colada!?! Eeks! No way!If you are here with family and small children, it's probably not a good idea to reserve a room at Treasure Island because they may be smoke sensitive. My family specifically reserved a non smoking room yet we received a smoking room. You could tell by just entering the hallway, they try to mask the smoke smell with some air freshener. The room is decent but the bottom-line is they did not meet what we reserved.I was here in 2013 and it was for a bachelor party.  At that point it was great.  Lots of booze, a pool, and a casino.  We really didn't need more than that.

In 2014 I came with my wife and I came and stayed here.  We check in, we are informed that they didn't have the king bed we booked three months ago.  So we got a room with two queens.  I initially put my stuff on one of the beds and it just sank.  The springs in the mattress were well past their prime.  So we went to the other bed, it was fine.

Then my wife goes to take a shower.  She asks me to call the front desk and ask for a new shower head.  I ask her why and she tells me because we didn't have one.  Really?!?! someone stole the shower head from the room and the hotel didn't realize it and replace it before we get there.

They fixed the issue, but it shouldn't have occured in the first placeSo, yeah, it's not the nicest place on the strip, but seriously, I've stayed in worse. And hell, how can you not dig the Dealertainers! I had a guy from East LA dressed up like Ricky Martin at a blackjack table. Guy was hilarious.

The hotel probably needs to be 'sploded and redone, but, really, it's cheap, and how much time do you really spend in your room in Vegas anyway?ehhh......
a group of friends and I came here on our last morning before leaving Vegas.  I got the Gabi Chopped Salad with chicken and it really wasnt that good, especially for $15.  It sounded delish but ehh...  3 of my friends were in the mood for a really good crepe so they ordered the mushroom and chicken crepe.  They all hated it.  I took a bite and it was pretty nasty.  Someone else got the ham and cheese crepe and it was supposidly better than the mushroom crepe.  Another person got a burger but threw a fit because they didn't have American cheese.  The fit was stopped when he ordered a virgin pina colada and about died it was so good.  The last person ordered one of the steaks and frites and he really liked it.  They all said the frites were kind of weird though.

I would give this place 2 stars but the 3rd star is from the build-your-own bloody mary. mmm it was delicious!!  you could add celery, pepper, bell peppers, onions, carrots..i forget what else but the bloody mary was great.   the veggies were actually pretty wilted and not very fresh though, but whatever.I have visited this bistro several times since Paris hotel and casino is one of my favorite casinos to visit when I am in Vegas.  I was also familiar with the original in Chicago.

This last visit was not a happy occassion but you can only stand homecooked food for a certain time before you decide to go out when you visit family.

The meal itself was good, I had steak dijon well done (as requested)and my partner had the skate.  He had the soup of the day vegetarian style (very good) and I had the salade maison. 

Overall the whole meal was satisfactory including the drinks.  One note, bistros are normally small in France and in the context of Vegas, nothing is small so this one has a lot of space and its outdoor patio has the view of the dancing fountains of Bellagio.  

The service itself is exemplary except for the wait.  The salad and the soup came on a reasonable time but the entree was really a long wait.  In any restaurant, this is not excusable especially for a place not really very crowded.  When you finish the appetizer/soup/salad, you expect the dinner to come at an appropriate time.  Little quibble but prices should reflect overall service, food, timing and other extras.

One more thing, great warm bread and always ask for more if you are really enjoying, it will be good for your soup and waiting on the rest of the dinner.

No dessert to review, only had espresso. Overall recommended but not highly.Food high quality, but not particularly imaginative. Atmosphere mediocre unless you have a patio seat, which offers a great view of the Bellagio fountain. I would recommend Mon Ami Gabi for first time tourists, as it would be uber cool, but for seasoned tourists or locals there are better options for a spectacular meal.We wanted to try the best of the best, so we aimed toward the more expensive items on the menu, which are the filet mignon and the seafood platter.  It was like something I can easily make at home.  I was hyped up because of the high ratings on Yelp and so I was left disappointed.   We didn't even care to stay for desserts.I want to give 5 stars alone for the restaurant being so accomodating when I tried booking a large party lunch reservation for my birthday weekend. Drew, their group event planner, was very helpful with the reservation process, willingly changing our reservation time and at the last minute, changing it from a large party (12 people) to only 4 people for lunch.

However the food was ok for the price and ambiance. We were seated at a table next to another 2 top table literally inches away from us ("rubbing elbows" is an understatement." The servers were nice, attentive and well informed of the specials. I went with the lobster roll, which was stuffed with lobster but was too creamy for my taste (I favor traditional New England lobster rolls that highlight the lobster with basic butter.) My chips started out crispy but were bland and tough to chew by meals end. I liked the idea of my boyfriends open faced tuna melt sandwich, but preferred eating his fries which were crispy and seasoned well. My girlfriend got the seafood crepe, and she said the scallops were cooked to perfection, but very pricey ($19) for what you got. Her husband scarfed down his corned beef hash and eggs, but the portion was so small, he finished my lobster roll for me.

I might have given another star if we were sat on the patio but it was a 45 minute wait! Overall, It wasn't bad but I would check out Bouchon for a bigger brunch menu next time.On the way back to our suite to play some bachelorette party games, we were stopped by a host (a promoter?) who offered us a free bottle of champagne and table service. We didn't want to be rude, so...

The service was great and the hostesses were very attentive to the guests. It was a little bit quiet when we first arrived at about 10:30pm but it quickly got busy. The crowd was a bit on the older side than most other bars/clubs I've been to on the Strip. We didn't stay for very long as it got really crowded really quickly.

A nice bonus: There is hookah available.This is one of my regular haunts.  Its main virtues: it has a near perfect center Strip location, with Caesars Palace, Bellagio, and Ballys as neighbors; it's one of the cheaper places in the immediate vicinity.  Add to this reasonably comfortable rooms and a very good swimming pool, and I can overlook the negatives: run down feel, boring restaurants, mediocre gym.

Registration is available at the airport, although once at the hotel you must still go to the registration desk (but using a very short line).  One time, the line at the airport was very long, so I crossed my fingers and decided to register at the hotel.  This worked out well, as the line was very short, and I was done in less than ten minutes.  However, beware:  during my stays I've noticed that at times the line was horrendous.

The elevators have seen better days (worn/dirty floors; lights and bells worked poorly), and the hallways are nothing to shout about.  However, the rooms are generally OK, with reasonably clean carpeting and furniture.  The bathroom is on the small side, and the shower head is placed low on the wall.  I'm 5'10", and it was a minor inconvenience; for anyone taller, it would be a pain in the neck - literally.  Note that some rooms have been recently renovated - the "Go" rooms - are are reputedly nicer.I've been obsessed with Ancient Egypt since I was a little girl and I was really stoked to stay at this hotel. I loved all the hieroglyphics carved into the walls (if you haven't figured it out I'm a big nerd... I got teased for wanting to be an Egyptologist instead of a teacher or fireman like a lot of other kids) and the rooms in the west tower were large and  nicely decorated with very large bathrooms and tubs. The hotel itself is beautiful but it has a LOT less going on inside than the other hotels and my family and I ended up spending a lot more time at the Excalibur and New York New York than our own hotel. 

I will say that I was really impressed by their Pyramid Cafe's food and the Pharoah's Pheast Buffet. The food was really tasty and much better than the other Vegas buffets I had eaten at. The pizza at Pyramid Cafe is made to order and very fresh. SOOOO good... it was a very pleasant surprise.

I was disappointed that check-in doesn't begin until 11:30am... c'mon, it's Vegas! People are coming in at all hours of the day and making a ton of people wait until 11:30 and then having them all bum-rush the counter resulting in a VERY VERY long line is a system that does not work very well. 

Suzanne B. is NOT lying when she talks about the towels being tiny and feeling like sandpaper because as soon as I grabbed one the word "sandpaper" instantly popped into my mind. The hotel bed comforter was not much better. Very thin, stif and scratchy. Disappointing.

 I also expected that a big hotel would offer free wi-fi to it's guests in their rooms but instead I saw people in the hallways leading to the west tower walking around with their laptops trying to find a connection. Last but not least, I didn't like that microwaves and refrigerators weren't provided in the rooms. My dad is diabetic and needs to refrigerate his insulin and we had to call the front desk and have them deliver a bulky mobile one to his room. Also... I thought that maid service usually happened at a decent hour like noon  ;p  ... however, we were sorely mistaken when the maid walked into our room at 9am after a long long long night of drinking and gambling.Luxor seemed alright.

Stuck between Excalibur, the hotel I stayed at, and Mandalay Bay, the hotel hosting the conference I was at, Luxor was a good location for me to pass through on my way to someplace else.  The same way most people think of my home state, New Jersey.

Luxor is gorgeous outside.  The giant pyramid, outlined in lights and sending a beam into the sky at night, with a obelisk and a sphinx standing guard.  Inside, it's impressive as well, certainly more so than Excalibur, where I stayed, but I was sad to see the Egyptian theme fall to the background behind the omnipresent glitz and sheen of Vegas.

Nice, for what it is, but I prefer the thematic consistency of NY-NY and Paris.

For whatever reason, I also found Luxor to be the most oppressive, cigarette smoke-wise.  I hated how smoking was allowed in all the casinos in Vegas anyway, but most seemed to have better ventilation or less smoking.  I still wish there were designated no-smoking gambling areas.

To be fair, I was starting to get sick the night the smoke bothered me the most, but still, even after that point I didn't find the other casinos as bad as Luxor.

I saw Bodies... The Exposition at Luxor and found it much more interesting and... enjoyable? (odd adjective to choose here) than I expected.  Humans have a surprisingly small spleen.

Ate at Tender Steak and Seafood, and I'll review that elsewhere.

I dunno. Not too much to say about Luxor, really.  I loved that it shared a tram with Mandalay Bay and Excalibur.  I wish all the casinos were on a tram.  Those places are too far apart.Well where do i start ... lets start with the fact that i stayed here in Feb 25th 2010 was my 2nd time going to Vegas and was just looking for a good deal Luxor was the pick! we got to the hotel and it looked a little run down we thought oh well were not going to be in the room for long any ways. We got to the room and felt that it was a little gloomy and of course it looked alot more run down then the hotel it self. I understand that it was built some time ago but the rooms need major renos. The bars i went to were Flight bar Aurora or something both were great!!

*The bar tender at Flight Bar made me a Raspberry lemonade martini with a pink sugar rim fresh squeezed raspberrys and it was good!! 

*I checked out the Titanic exhibition and it was really good !! well worth the $30.00 something i paid line ups were huge tho so make sure you do not go around lunch time !! 

LAX nighclub was one of the better ones ive been to so far! Classy look on the inside but wayy tooo crowded! I know my post seems pretty negative but i didnt mind any of it at all i can see others who will never go back but for me its a nice small hotel not as big as the other ones and its easy to get around to other hotels near by Mandalay Bay , Excalibre, New York New York, MGM Grand! 

I do say give it a try .. but only of your looking for a good deal after staying at the Aria i probably wont go back to the Luxor but i had and enjoyable stay!! no issues with service everyone was fantastic!!I have never stayed here, but I heard they got themselves a topless pool, so i will totally check it out. The House of Blues is here, where I saw my first Morrissey show back in the halcyon days of 1999, and they have a ton of restaurants, bars, clubs, etc., but nothing to write home about. It's CROWDED and the people are either too cool or weird middle aged couples in Las Vegas T shirts, watching the band do bad disco covers from outside the lounge. The dining is Asian themed, like the resort, plus the obligatory "red white and blue" option, so that no one suspects Mandalay Bay of not loving America. There is also a "fine dining" option with a prix fixe menu which costs an arm and a leg and is probably not worth it. Come here for the shark reef.Maybe it's just me, but I think adding a $15 / day resort fee is just gouging us... It's sort of like airlines, they don't want to post a higher price, so they tack on all sorts of fees.

The rooms are large, and bathrooms are nice.we got a mini suite here and i have no major complaints. the room just seems worn down. it didnt seem adequately prepared for us-- the mini bar wasnt stocked, the table tops werent dusted. we randomly got a few calls in the middle of the night asking if our shower handle was broken. weird. plus the elevators take foreverrrrr.Stayed here several times over the years, due to it's location on the strip I only stay here when there is a conference in the hotel, since all of the other hotels in the immediate area suck. The rooms are decent, they have been refreshed not too long ago. There is a good selection of bars, the restaurants here are generally lacking in quality. 

Rooms get a 4
Venue gets a 2.5 or 3My first time to this place was back in January 2011 after it was recommended by a friend. This place is not cheap by any means between myself and two others, the bill came to about $400. But my issue isn't so much with the money as it is the quality and value I expected to get for that price.

I went on the cheaper side by getting a Surf and Turf for $65. It wasn't great and it wasn't bad either. I thought the lobster was actually better than the steak. My friend ordered the Surf and Turf as well and he shared the same opinion: it was just OK. The bottom line is: It wasn't worth $400.

Afterwards, I shared my disappointment with the friend who recommended this place to me. He said Surf and Turf wasn't the way to go and I should've ordered the Wagyu beef or filet. So a couple of days ago, I gave it another shot.

We went with a group of 12 people. The waiter highly recommended the chef special where you can get three courses but at least two people have to order it. I asked what the difference was between the beef in the Surf and Turf and the one in the special. He said the Surf and Turf was a grade 6 (it was 6 or 7) and the special was a grade 9. So I decided to join two others and placed the order.

We got three different cuts of Wagyu beef with this combo. There was filet mignon, new york, and ribeye. We asked for medium rare but all three cuts came out as medium. It was pink in the center but all three of us felt that it was overdone. When we compared all three with our friends who ordered just the standalone filet, theirs was actually done just right. Somehow, medium rare for the standalone was better and done correctly but the more expensive one was not. Go figure.

To say the least, the waiter was nice about it and gave good service throughout the entire time. He took back all three cuts and asked the kitchen to give us new ones. That took about 10 to 15 mins. Once the food came, it came out just the way we asked and expected...medium rare. It was tender and very pink for all three cuts.

None of us were able to finish all the beef. I think part of the reason was that it was too rich. The amount of oil from the serving dish was pretty thick. We had asparagus, mushroom risotto, and baby spinach as sides so they contributed to the feast.

Here's my bottom line. I gave this place second try and it didn't really make me feel any better. I spent quite a bit more this time...$175 for my meal and the overall experience was just barely OK. I'd never come back here again because I don't feel like it's worth my money. I can easily go to a different steakhouse for $100 in Vegas to get a better value.As a fan of Tom Colicchio from Top Chef I really wanted to love this place.  Today's rating reflects the disappointment I felt. The rating is also based upon a comparison with comprable restaurants as Craftsteak would get five stars if I compared it to Sizzler. (sorry all you sizzler fans)

I expected an overpriced steak house so the three rating is not a reflection of price so much as it is of value.  For instance, I have had 5 star experiences at Hank's and Delmonicos.

From the moment I walked in, I was disappointed.  While I expected a somewhat less glitzy environment, I felt like I was in the Hofbrauhaus as the place was jam packed with tables, noisy and the decor seemed uninspired (cow paintings, really? And not very good ones either).  

I have to give a shout out to the 5 star service we received.  The waitstaff was amazing.  Yet I found it disconcerting that the dining manager was out in the dining area discussing issues and business within four feet of the diners.

We started with the diver sea scallop appetizer which was exactly as advertised and well prepared so I began to feel at ease.  The waiter suggests the scallops or the lobster bisque but we knew we could never finish two appetizers and our meal. The drinks, although pricy were creative and excellent as well.

I ordered the rib eye and my dining partner ordered the surf and turf.  We ordered sides of mixed exotic mushrooms and grits with bacon.  The sides were excellent and the grits may well have been the best dish of the meal even if grits aren't your thing.

The main course arrived and well I can only say I was overwhelmed by the size and underwhelmed by the taste.  The large 18 OZ ribeye looked so good in the metal pan that I couldn't wait to dig in.  But first I have to rewind.  I like my steak medium rare most of the time but I find good steakhouses tend to think rare = raw, medium rare = rare etc.  So I asked the waiter what the chef's medium rare was.  The waiter told me medium rare was red center, pink surrounding and medium rare was pink all the way through.  So I went with medium rare.  Unfortunately it came out red all the way through.  Im ok with that but I would have gone with medium had I known.   The steak was well seasoned but the meat was much tougher than I have had at other steak houses and the marbling was not rendered down enough causing a rough cut.

The Lobster was nearly flavorless and chewy.  The filet was cooked medium but was actually medium rare so we enjoyed it but it too did not pack a punch.

We looked at the desert menu but I was already disenchanted so I refrained.  My dining partner had the souffle which was not in the top 5 souffle's we have had, even at less distinguished establishments.

So while the meal was above a chain and probably above most off strip places, it earns a 3 which according to Yelp means A-OK which satisfies my review standards.  4 would mean I was a fan which I am not and will not go back short of someone offering to pay for the meal which was pricey (2 people, 4 drinks, 1 app, 2 steaks and 2 sides nearly $400.00.  

They do offer fixed price meals with choices which would have given us more food for only a little more money but we didn't finish what we had and were glad we didn't opt for the extra side and dessert.

Bottom line, while this is a premium steak house there are many equal or better choices for the same price or less within 15 miles.  I could list about 10 off the top of my head if anyone wants to know.  I'll make a list if some of you readers ask.Eating tacos at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino is what being young, sexy and cheap are all about. Hey, I know you are going to spend hundreds for dinner, so why not take a cheap meal while you can? Especially, when you can do it at the Hard Rock.Best Vaginal themed mexican restraunt on earth!  Other reviewers knock the lack of authenticity.  But, frankly, if I'm eating at a mexican restraunt named after a woman's anatomy I'm not necessarily looking for the place to be following strict traditional guidelines.  So, whatever.  The guac and the salsa are both really good here.  The food is fresh and good quality.  It certainly is overpriced, but its very nice and the waitstaff is RETARDED hot.

eww, this is starting to sound like a review from hooter's.  i quit.This place is so over-rated. I was so disapointed because Thomas Keller is one of my culinary heroes. In any case, it wasn't bad... but with so many choices at simliar prices in the same casino even... I wouldn't recommend a visit. Perhaps, you should try Lutece or Valentino's instead. Both, are must sees.We had dinner there this past weekend and had high hopes but they fell a little short.  It was a perfectly fine dinner but with a name like Thomas Keller attached to the name, I expect elevated everything.

We had a reservation and they ran 20 minutes past.  Our server was delightfully low-key and the appetizers were delicious.  Fresh pea soup, bib lettuce salad, and oysters. Yum!

The main course was where things started to go wrong.  All entrees were too salty to enjoy.  I ate about a quarter of my trout and my husband had about the same with his gnocchi.  Also, the portion sizes were HUGE.  I know this is America: Land of Large Portions but again, I was expecting something a bit more refined.

Add to that the fact that the restaurant terrace backs on to the pool at the Venetian which remains open until 9pm....(which means you'll be treated to whoop whoops of drunk party goers if you dine before 9pm)...it felt a little 'average' and not 'amazing.'

Not likely to return.I liked the wine.  The food was yummy.  But for the money, I want a better overall dining experience.  The talbes were tooooooo close together.

ps - for the ladies, the floors are slick tiles.  Take that into account when selecting the stilletos you're going  to wear here.It pains me to write a mediocre review for Olives. The balcony seats are beautiful and my wife and I fell in love with Vegas because of our experience the the first time we dined at olives. 

Unfortunately our second visit did not live up and I'm sad to say that we will probably not be returning to this location. The view does not make up for all of its shortcomings. Let me start with the strong points - view, service, cocktails, and wine list. The food and moderately rude hostess are what don't hold up. 
-Chilled avocado soup: very bland and uneventful
-gazpacho: good... Nice spice but not really any other dimension
-lobster wrap pasta: quite good, but at $45 it's really just average
- prime filet: slightly overlooked and slightly dry and the sauce was blocked (and soaked up) by the potatoes. Plus you get what tastes to be a frozen crab cake plopped on the side of your plate that tasted a bit funky.

Unfortunately, this is when we gave up on this restaurant. I had half my plate thrown away, had our $150 bottle of wine corked, and disenchantingly requested our check. I mentioned some of the meals shortcomings to the waiter the end of the meal (my mistake for waiting) and made it clear I was not looking for discounts... I just wanted to pass on the feedback since it was a family favorite and we had such great memories from our first time here. Unfortunately I don't think the feedback was understood (probably just pegged us as a young couple that doesn't know what good dining really is), but the waiter did graciously reduce the bill (slightly)

This was our last meal for our Vegas trip and unfortunately it was the worst. I'm left frustrated that I still don't have a proper steak to pair with the beautiful wine that remains on my counterI cant say that I was too impressed with this venue.  If you are expecting to go here to club, you will be sorely dissapointed.  The place is more of a giant bar with a small dance floor and flying go-go dancers hanging from the ceilings.  The bar is amazing but it was simply too small.  I agree with a lot of the reviewers, go before 10 to avoid paying cover.  It is not worth paying cover for this place unless its free.I give 2.5 stars for the architecture and a 1/2 star for everything else. The slow service and flimsy drinks made the tip go south a might quick.  I had to tell the bartender how to make a few drinks, that were not exotic at all, do you have tending experience????

Its a place you have to go once and say you have been there, like that Rain Forest joint. This place is spendy, but hell, you are at Mandalay Bay and you are in Vegas... so be geeky and look at the architecture like I do.Service was great throughout the dinner and dishwares were very cute.  The only problem is the space between tables  was limited and seems little  too crowded.

The food presentation for each course was nice same as wine pairings.  However, the taste is lack of complexity and ingredients didn't have much natural flavor.  i am not sure if they have sauce chef on site.

For the price we paid, I think we should pay a abit more and move to Picasso instead.If you get your shop on like I do, and you've exhausted the shops at Bellagio and Venetian, The Mag Mile at Planet Hollywood, The Forum Shops at Caesars, and The Fashion Show Mall, then your next stop just may be the Las Vegas Premium Outlets. 

Some of the stores - Benetton, 7 For All Mankind, A|X Armani Exchange, Banana Republic, Calvin Klein, Bebe, BCBG, Ann Taylor Loft, Ann Klein, Burberry, Diesel, Brooks Brothers, Chicos, Cole Haan, Kenneth Cole, Ferragamo, Nine West, Stuart Weitzman, Timberland, Puma...the list goes on. 

Now, this is not the BEST premium outlet shopping center, but if you have the patience an the time, you just might find some great deals.They have a great HH (for the strip)! From 4-8 pm, 50% off food and $5 drinks. This was a life-saver, we were starving and didn't wanna pay an arm and a leg. Our burgers were really good, and it was $7.50 for a cheeseburger and fries. The kitchen messed up my hubby's order, and the bartender was very nice about taking it back, and comped him a drink. I was driving, so I didn't have any drinks, but the hubby seemed happy with his. Friendly people, good burgers, good HH prices.The legendary 777 meal lives on at Mr Luckys. Can't really beat the price where for 7.77 you get a meal on the cheap including salad, steak cooked to order and 3 extremely tender shrimp. Don't look for it on the menu, it's not there. The 777 still carries a certain in-crowd cache among people in the know.We had breakfast there one morning and it was actually really good. Our waiter was less than enthusiastic to start but ended up being a really good guy by the time we left. Typically priced - an omelette was about $15 and it was really good. Sometimes service can be a bit slow but I will say go between the breakfast rush and the lunch rush if you can - Lines to get seated can get long...This was a nice depature from the scene at the Hard Rock. While the food was just okay (the sausages needed a little something extra and the sauerkraut was good with just enough sour), the tall and cold beers are what hit the spot. I enjoyed the Wheat Beer plus the shot of something that my co-worker talked us all into having.

What better way to kick off a business trip and 'bond' with co-workers than raising your beer stein and singing along with the band?We came in on a wednesday afternoon and wanted to get some beers and snacks.
I was surprised that they only had three beers, but I guess that's just the Hofbrauhaus way.  I had wanted to try a range of German beers, but three was what we had to choose from.  The wheat was probably the best, but nothing to come back for.

We got this great food sampler the server recommended for us.
Two pretzels, two mustards, tons fo sauerkraut, and maybe 5 or 6 different sausages.
The pretzels did not taste super fresh, but were quite good. 
The sausages were amazing.

All in all, I don't feel a need to return, which is a shame, but it was a fun experience and I would recommend trying it if you haven't.My food was good, but I'm a bit biased as I really liked my local Il Fornaio in San Francisco. So when my "usual" appetizers and dishes weren't on this particular restaurant's menu, I was bit disappointed.  BUT the service and the ambiance was definitely consistent and great. 

I ordered the salmon which was really fresh and well prepared. I really liked the veggie minestrone as well. Although Il Fornaio is good and well, I wasn't particularly blown away by my dinner either; too many other Italian restaurants in LV to try.


-The theater is non smoking, but the smoke from the Casino effectively makes this a smoking production.  This is different from (for example) Cher, which had great ventilation and was truly a non smoking show.  If that bothers you, be warned.
 

The production is pretty much as advertised and in accordance with all of the reviews.  Beautiful topless women, crazy costumes,  dancing around with a bunch of guys in a musical.  


The acts between the main acts were good too.  On 2/09 there were these two gymnasts looking like blue man group (only painted silver) who did incredible athletic  feats - one of them balanced on one hand on the other guy's head!    Another is a guy on the ropes hanging from the ceiling.  The third was a juggler.


A good show and exactly what you would expect.  Just remember that despite the ticket labels, it's a smoking show because of casino proximity.I hadn't been to the Bellagio buffet in years, mainly bc 1) it's damn expensive (over $30) and 2) buffets make me feel disgusting.  As a general rule, I stay away from all-you-can-eat, but I made an exception bc my friend's company was expensing the dinner.  I'd really rather spend the money on a really good single entree.  As expected, there was a lot to choose from, although nothing really excited me.  I did learn that you can have them heat up your crab legs if you don't want them cold!  They had a variety of fish, some veggies, salads, some sushi, meats, etc. and a lot of desserts to choose from.  Stay away from the flan - it's gross.  The creme brulee was very good, as was the key lime tart.  The chocolate mousse had the consistency of water, though it tasted fine.  Surprisingly, what I liked the best was their bread, which is homemade.  They had my favorite - pretzel bread - and yummy mini baguettes, both of which I stuffed in my bag for later.  Oh, yes I did.  Go early (before 6 p.m.) bc when we got out an hour and a half later, there was a huge line.My visit to here confirmed that buffeting is a young man's sport!!  They have most of the usual option and do it well.  At $50 a head, you could also get a very good meal somewhere else and not feel sick afterwards.   Just saying....The food at the Spice Buffet was adequate, but not anything to write home about. The crab legs were steamed but not warm. The middle eastern fare was just ok. They had salad stations for each region. The rib steak was really quite rare. The  italian buffet fell short big time. Pasta was of low quality.  If I could, I would give this buffet  2 and one half stars. Def not a smorgasbord. Food was average. It was in my estimation a little better than the Bellagio which I feel is extremely overrated!This place was OK, they definitely have a good assortment of food.

During a trip to Las Vegas last year in Nov. we did the buffet of buffets and we tried this place out. It was good. The thing I liked the most was their cupcakes, I was amazed at how many different kinds they had.The Tao Nightclub has been such a hit and miss for me. The first few times I've been here (when it first opened) it was exciting to see the posh Asian decor and half nude women "bathing" in the tubs and all the people.... But now, this place feels tired. The wait is outrageous if you don't get on the guestlist or tables. It's so crowded you get jostled around! Hello, that's not fun. There's not much room to dance and difficult to get to the bar to order drinks! Sure, we manage to have fun but usually we escape to the V-Bar downstairs to have some real fun.So i finally gave in and went to Tao this past winter, the Saturday before New Years.  And I must admit, while I really REALLY wanted to hate it, it wasn't all that bad.  Pretty damn good actually.  See, this is the problem with reviews sometimes - you can't always base your opinion entirely on someone else's, sometimes you really just have to check it out for yourself.  

So I went the normal route for entry, used a VIP pass and maybe waited about 7 minutes before I was let in.  As this was winter and I was smart enough to wear a coat, I went straight to the top level where the ($5) coat check was and got myself situated.  And that's pretty much where I stayed the rest of the night.  

I made some new friends and was able to enjoy their table service, but this is not the only reason why I had a genuinely good time here.  The crowd was lively but it wasn't ass-to-elbows crowded up there...  They had a guy jump up on the balcony with the dancers and TEAR IT UP to Enur's Calabria on the saxophone....  The bathrooms are freakin off the hizzle with the clear-to-opaque door change....  Overall it was just FUN.  I enjoyed the overall atmosphere and decor, and of course the chicks in bathtubs are a nice addition (even if most of their fingertips were pruning and they looked chilled).  And I did buy at least one drink and don't remember being shocked at the $$$, so its obviously comparable to other clubs on the strip (actually, I had WAY WAY more fun here than the 10 times or so I've been in Pure...)

I had a great time here and will definitely be going back again this summer, hopefully this time I will actually see the rest of the club and Tao Beach.   I think since this is one of the more popular clubs on the Strip, it is definitely worth a try.ehhhh, its just okay here.  I think they are trying a little too hard to make everything spectacular.  We went here on a Friday night, and the line was SUPER long. It wrapped around the whole upstairs in front of Tao.  We decided to do bottle service, which was a pretty good deal. It got us to the front of the line, our own bottle, and a nice place to sit.

The dance floors were crowded, but mostly with people standing around. It was kind of weird to dance next to a bunch of people who were just standing and talking to each other.  The music was alright.  The ambiance was just okay.  Putting half naked girls on top of each other does not make the scene any nicer.  It was kind of awkward, actually. 

However, the bouncers were pretty cool.  Not only were they nice, but they were always willing to watch our table when we wanted to go upstairs.  The hostesses were also helpful.  

Cool place to visit once, not sure if I would come back here.  btw, I was told there was a line for hotel guests, but when I got there.. i found no such thing.I came here this past thursday. Me and my friends (4 girls and 1 guy) were all able to get in for free. But we were put on the guestlist through a promoter.

The nightclub is really dark and mysterious. We went on a night where there was a bunch of old guys (us being 21-22) and it wasn't really fun. Some people like this place, some people dont. It wasn't packed like sardines on a thursday, it normally is on Fridays and Saturdays. I would suggest trying this club out just to try it out, but I don't think I would ever come back here.The Hotel is very nice, but as far as great hotels go, this one is good.  I have stayed here twice now and both stays were about the same.

The rooms are spacious, and nice.  I love having the living room, bedroom and extra powder room.  The beds were comfortable, the bathroom is amazing (love the huge tub and shower).

It would have been 4 stars except for the quirkiness!  First stay, the shower didn't drain the first morning and filled up to the top and almost flooded the bathroom, the room safe was already locked when we arrived in the room and we had to call to have it unlocked by the locksmith.  The mini-bar is the old fashioned, need a key style, which we didn't get our key when we checked in (I have a mini-bar thing!), we called, someone brought one up (very nice!)...and the next morning housekeeping took it.  Hmmm.

Second stay, 1/2 of the lights in our room didn't work.  Except for the one's in the closets...which we had to slam the doors shut a few times to get them to go off.

One thing I will say is that I completely understand that hotels have issues and guests will have problems.  However, it's how the hotel deals with the issues that makes all the difference.  They did a great job of that.  The service makes me go back and forth between 3 and 4 stars - but I'm settling on 3 because I think they could do just a little better on the room maintenance/upkeep.Host: 2.0
Waiter: 3.5
Food-taste, presentation: 3.0
Property-style, decor, ambiance: 4.5

In the city where excess is the norm; this "most coveted" (per the hotel's concierge) did not meet expections.After party hardy drinking at rockhouse, we were having the after drinking junkfood galore carb load cravings, particularly Mexican at that moment...
5 of us decided to go to Diego since that was the closest thing to Mexican in the hotel.

Our server was SO NICE even if some of us were drunk and acting annoying. He made suggestions on what is good and brought everything and more that we needed for the table. 
The tableside made guacamole was delicious as well. We were snacking on the chips with salsa/guac while waiting for our food which took quite awhile...

Their carne asada is the best thing out of all the things we ordered that night.... My boyfriend got some fish dish : seabass and he thorougly enjoyed it but me and my friend thought its texture in our mouth was like mucus cuz it was way too soft...
i got this pork dish which i forgot. It was fork tender and good with the tortillas but not something i would pay $$$ for ...
Its not someplace i would come back to and not worth spending money on unless it was comped like this time. I have a hard time justifying spending $$$ on mexican food.

Some king taco and carne asada super fries wouldve cured that junky mexican craving better, Of course but hey its Vegas!I reallyyyy really wanted dessert after eating not the best dinner...and since we were back in the hotel at Paris I decided to stop by here.

The cashier lady was very nice and kind, but seemed to have a bit of trouble at the register.  I think maybe something was broken so it took a while for us just to get to order.

I ordered the Napoleon crepe, lemon custard, berries, chantilly cream, nom nom nom! It was REALLY good, the tartness of the custard and lightly sweet thick chantilly cream worked well together.

Unfortunately they don't fill all the way to the edge so the front tip of the triangle is filled while the back end is just crepe.  Is that how it's done in Paris?  I also feel like they were a bit too thick and eggy to be considered "good" crepes, but it was tasty nonetheless. I think the filling just sold me...

$9.99 does seem expensive to me for a crepe since they are kind of cheap to make...but it is Vegas so got to expect everything to be expensive :P

I MIGHT come back here again just for the Napoleon...if I'm ever in Vegas again...My first Cirque show in Vegas and it hurts me to give this a 3 star review but unfortunately, it didn't take my breath away.  Yes, the performances were amazing but the show overall just felt like it dragged as time went by and in many instances, lost my attention.  There was just too much going on at one time that it just made it a little difficult for me to keep up with the storyline.  Come to think of it... was there even one?  Anyhow, the costumes and the stage it self was gorgeous.  The performers... such talent.  I guess I had such high expectations for this show that I was a bit disappointed when it didn't fully captivate me.  Thought I got a deal when I saved 20% on tickets booking the 10pm show, but it turned out to be the most expensive nap I paid for when I turned over to see the husband falling asleep 10 minutes into the show.Very dark room....I started to doze off so don't go tired.  It was entertaining but not like 5 star, edge of my seat...I did just say I started to doze off (don't tell anyone ok?!).  I wish one of the people I was with that supposedly caught this very simple story line broke it down cuz I missed it...sorry.  So that leaves me to be entertained by the moving stage - that was very cool.  There were some great parts but really....my heart belonged to LOVE at Mirage...just more entertaining and upbeat.  Didn't love KA but I didn't hate it either....We got free passes for Tabu when I met a promoter in the casino at the MGM. We were supposed to get free vodka drinks until midnight. Not having to wait in line was a plus, but I was not pleased with how we were treated when we got inside. We waited like 15 minutes for a bartender to finally give us attention, only to find out that the free vodka drinks ended at 11PM (it was after 11:30 at that point). I felt like the one bartender felt like he was hot ish for blatantly ignoring myself and my friends, but in actuality man, you're just a douchebag. Anyway, I really wanted to like Tabu. It seems like a super fun place. The DJ was spinning really good tracks and I loved the decor and the crowd. Maybe I will give it another chance during a future trip to Vegas.The reason I am leaving 3 stars is when I stayed there 7-6 to 7-9 there was some sort of dance competition going on with tweens and teen aged girls. 
COMPLETELY ruined my peaceful getaway to Henderson. 
They were loud and their moms were letting them run amuck. Las Vegas is not a place to bring teenagers. The adults who are paying for a vacation for peace and quiet did not get it. 
The staff was courteous and polite and all went above and beyond for us. Except some person who answered the phone who called herself "Kathy" she was rude and told the assistant manager when I reported a bottle of patron missing from our room.  The assistant manager was a sweetheart and the poor lady was getting chewed out by a dance mom when we went to go see her.  We didn't yell at her. It was not her fault some things weren't getting done. 
We were told that they removed the patron bottles for "expiration date" purposes. We think one of the staff was stealing them because other guests stated to us that the bottles were missing from their rooms as well. Some of the housekeeping staff decided not to clean our room after our first night. But once I told the front desk they sent someone right away. I will give the staff props for trying to make things right whenever I presented a concern....except when I was put on hold for 20 mins and the operator never returned when I was calling to report the missing patron bottle from our room. 


Check-In was extremely painful I think it was due to the dance moms and their kids. Now don't get me wrong, I like children, I LOVE them actually but these bunch of girls made me want to blow my brains out....and I was on VACATION!

We had booked our stay so we could see Jeff Timmons perform. We were disappointed we weren't offered a discount. We saw him perform at the Rio last year with the Chippendale's and they offered us special packages to stay at their hotel. 

This resort was just beautiful. There is a target down the street and a cheesecake factory all located near the resort. I fell in love with the place my last night there.  If I ever get married, I want to do it here. The rates are very reasonable and the grounds are beautiful....but I have yet to check out Caesar's Palace. ha ha

This is definitely a great place to stay off the strip. I love Las Vegas but as I get older I like a bit of serenity on vacation and Green Valley's property offers that. 

I just hope in the future they don't hold dance competitions on the weekend I am staying there.Resort looks very nice and great appearance but rooms have very poor plumbing.  Heard water being ran through pipes all night and hardly got any sleep.  Got groupon deal but look to pay 29 dollars per night for resort fee even though groupon states 24.99 and another 18 dollars in tax per night ( 47 dollars per day).  Spa and workout facilities are kept up very nicely and pool is also very nice.The staff members are all complete idiots. But it's the nicest venue in Las Vegas to see a band play live.Imma break this down into three sections.

1. The Pasta = Eh, I've had better.  (2.5 stars)

I ordered the Rigatoni Bolognese.  The rigatoni was cooked perfectly al dente, so yay, HOWEVER the bolognese was fairly blande and to give you a better picture of the quality - imagine a mix of Prego, ground beef from a can of Chef Boyardee, and a few tablespoons of oil.  And I thought this was supposed to be simmered for hours...

2. The Service = Not bad (3 stars)

Friendly, welcoming servers, nothing over and beyond but got the job done, so well-deserving of a standard 15% tip.

3. Dessert = The Real Deal HolymotherofgodthisisdeliciousField (9,000 stars)

I had heard the rumors about the butter cake.  I had seen pictures.  But none of that could prepare me for the sheer amazingness that is the butter cake.  It is so delicious that it doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same review as its mediocre pasta counterpart.  And so, I shall write a separate update!

To be continued...Reasonably priced, great country/farm-style food. Good selection. The maripan-filled croissants aren't the reason to eat here (try Cafe Soleil). Instead come here for the perfect frittata and generous plates fit only for the hunger called brunch.

Maybe its built into the low prices, but I could do without the kitchy decor, the noise and unremarkable bialys. Also, what happens if I don't want to eat my weight in eggs? Then I only eat coffee.

Bring some granola home.Inside Treasure Island: 
Signature Drinks (Classic Margarita, Mexican Cucumber, House Muddled Mojito, House Muddled Margarita)
Margaritas and Mojitos are terrific! Definitely a signature item, the muddled margarita comes in strawberry, raspberry, blackberry, pineappple, and cucumber. i tried the strawberry margarita, and with the chunks of strawberry, it was magnificent!  The mojito is the popular cuban drink, mixed with bacardi silver, fresh mint leaves, fresh squeezed lime juice, simple syrup, and house muddled fruit - if you prefer.  typical snacks include classic guacamole, chips and salsa, and empanadas.  located inside the casino, it is a cozy little bar with low lighting and latin beats...not to mention the video poker on the bar.  we were there at a strange hour, on a tuesday night.  one thirty am, and we were disappointed to find they were out of chips and salsa, as well as all other food items on the bar menu.  currently, as i am penning this, the bartender and her three ancillary staff members look preoccupied with talking to one another, instead of asking us if we would like another drink. my friend mike is purposely slurping the dregs of his mojito to indicate he is ready for another...i suppose timing is everything.  don't expect much on a weekday, at one thirty in the morning.
 
the bar stays open until 3am, serves food until 1045pm, and weekends until 1145.  so, not your typical vegas bar that never closes. well, do bars close here, ever?It's just $10/month. Can't go wrong with that!  What I'd like to add is they need free wi-fi and to really help with that funky bathroom smell.  For two years now it's still had the same smell.  Come on already with that.  While we're on the bathroom talk, why in the world is the tp holder so damn big next to the pot?  Sitting on the pot you have a constant lean.  

Ridiculous.

Other than that- all else is good.just get the coconut margarita! 

taco bell is better in respect to the food and service qualityWent here for lunch
Was bummed that they don't have pizza for lunch
Poo

So instead I got a sandwich and it was ok
The bread was tasty
Eh

I'm so bummed they didn't have pizza at lunch
:(This is my first time there. Had breakfast pasta and fez burger, loved the half off bottles of wine on sunday. The food was excellent but the service was poor. Had to go back to the host to tell them we had not seen a server yet after 20 min. Will go back again since the food was so good and I had a hard time deciding what to order. Stay tunedI had a pesto pizza and house salad and my boyfriend had a calzone with two toppings. Though I do like the smokiness of the pizza crust I thought it was just a little too thin and was a little irked that my pesto and cheese didn't stay on, as in the pesto cheese was completely separate and off of the crust. I found the cheese to be a little too chewy without being thick (I like chewy THICK cheese on pizza), but my boyfriend thought it was good, so to each his own. My boyfriend's calzone looked large but didn't really have that much inside of it. I thought the calzone crust was a little flat, like it needed to be a little more light and bready. My large house salad was nicely large (like with a couple slices of pizza you can make a meal). The location of this pizzeria is adorable at night (lots of lights). 

I do have to say that if I'm getting pizza around here, I would rather get Barro's.Stayed here for 1 night during the LIfe is Beautiful Festival, wanted to arrive early as I knew check in would be busy during that weekend.  When we got to the desk, we were told check in was at 4p, that seemed a little late for check in but I left my name and hoped we could just pick up our room keys when the room was available. Came back at 430 and the check in line was looong! We waited and since nothing was signed we had to wait to actually get a room assigened to us.  When we got to our room I was happy. The rooms are updated and spacious and wouldn't mind staying there for a night or 2 again.  My only complaint are the elevator wait times...they took forever and after a long day of walking around you don't want to wait in a crowded lobby just for an elevator to get there.  I liked the food court and other food options as they had Mcdonalds, Subway, and Zabbas.  They also had a sushi Restaraunt and Hash House (which seemed to have a long wait Sun morning, but that's expected) my only other tip is check to make sure you don't need anything from the gift shop that you may have forgot to pack because it does close...I believe I went around 1230a and they were closed.  The sports book is nice but the game I was trying to watch was featured on the small screen and was hard for me to see from the high top tables.  *sportsbook bar makes good bloody Mary's!Stopped in on Friday, didn't realize it was AYCE, but we rolled with it, after realizing our order would nearly be the same, and this way we could sample several items.

Last Samuri Roll: spicy tuna, cuke, cilantro and topped with shrimp and spicy mayo. Very tasty, would order again.

Orion Roll: spicy tuna, cuke topped with cajun albacore and garlic sauce. Again, very good.

Oh! Philly: salmon, cream cheese, cuke deep fried. It wasn't a favorite I'd likely pass on it next time.

9-1-1: Very spicy tuna, only a slight heat at first, but then the burn follows. Very good, but do have a drink onhand. 

Baked Green Mussel was recommended by the waiter. Flavor was good, but it was overcooked and a tad chewy.

Cinco de Mayo: Like jalapeno popper on steriods... fried pepper, cream cheese, spicy tuna and topped with spicy mayo. Yum! Yum! Yum!

Finished with green tea ice cream, creamy and delicious.

Sushi came quick. We surprised them when we asked for our check. We ate quick and not nearly as much as most diners, apparently. We were stuffed, in any case. If I had the appetite I'd return for AYCE. The Cinco de Mayo alone might lure me back.I went here for lunch and i thought it was just OKAY. i literally tried most of the food here and everything was just ok, not bad and not GREAT. just good.Red 8 is a nice Asian restaurant inside Encore however the food is okay.  Nothing I'll go crazy about since my palate loves authentic Chinese food.  Ambiance is gorgeous, service is friendly yet can improve for the better, price is ridiculous but what does one expect inside Encore."When you realize you've made a mistake, make amends immediately.  It's easier to eat crow while it's still warm."  -Dan Heist

My friends and I made reservations for dinner at MM before catching the 10pm Cirque du Soleil show at the Bellagio. Without delving into the details, let's just say the timing went awry and our dinner and show experience did not go as planned. 

Amends were made and handled with professionalism. Thank you Michael Mina for living up to your top tier reputation.Definitely a bit entertaining, but too much of the same thing over and over again.  I have to say I like some of the special effects, but overall we came out of the show not too entertained and almost felt like we got rob for our money.  For the price there is better shows in Vegas.I think this place is okay.  In a town of super pricey sushi- it is reasonable...but you pay for that in quality.  The dishes can be interesting and I was impressed by the diverse staff.  The service was quick and friendly.  But not the most impressive sushi I have ever had.  The rice was a little too wet, the fish the all you can eat quality...But I understand they have a spot in Torance CA...so maybe that location is different.When I used to work at Fashion Show mall this was a fav of mine to grab some lunch because they had bento boxes for decent prices, especially for strip prices. I used to get the teriyaki chicken bento box. Their happy hour is also good considering again it is on the strip. Good prices for drinks and food, during happy hour!Consistent, decent sushi.  I am never WOW'd here, but also never disappointed. Service is always good.The bossman recommended their kobe beef sliders, so of course, after walking from our room at the Palazzo all the way to MGM the plan was to swing around the other side of the strip and end up at Wynn for a fabulous quick dinner before our 7 PM Phantom showing at the Venetian.

However, we got caught in a freak thunder storm while at the Monte Carlo, and being cheapasses, we tried to wait out the storm by gambling (heh heh).  But being constantly hungry, my tummy couldn't take the abuse anymore (and I couldn't bear the thought of walking 2 miles in the rain without an umbrella) we finally waved down a cab and made our way to the Wynn.

I got the turkey burger, and our stint at BOA made my friend crazy about truffle oil chips, so he got their bleu cheese ones.  He also ordered the kobe beef sliders as his meal (he drank his fill at the various blackjack tables we visited while casino hopping hehe).

Bleu cheese truffle chips: Pretty good, but not as good as BOA.  The bleu cheese wasn't as pungent and salty as the kinds that go in my salads, so that was a good thing.  Some of the chips were also soft. . .bad.

Turkey burger: The spices in the turkey patty were a little strange. . .I wasn't a big fan of it. But the sauteed mushrooms and cheese and the toasted buttery cheesy topped bread was damn fine. The fries were also thinly cut, crispy and very good.  

Kobe beef sliders:  Not nearly enough meat and all bread!!!  The bread was very tasty though, and the caramelized onions added a hint of sweetness to the mini burgers.  The bbq dipping sauce for it was awesome. . .my bf dipped his fries in it, and I just dunked my entire slider in it hehe.

Yum, pretty good, it filled us up pretty well.  The portions are gigantic here!After carefully researching LV steakhouses - and having been to a good many before - we decided on Prime for dinner before seeing Love a few weeks ago.

I am giving it three stars on a straight ratings system.  Grading on a curve, using other top-end steakhouses as a reference, I would give it two stars.

The food was good, but not great.  The small lobster tail in my $100+ (DANG!) surf and turf was overcooked.  I've never sent anything back at a nice restaurant before and I rarely send anything back period, but that had to be resolved.  Staff was cool about it and handled it perfectly.

Service was good, but not amazing.  Our waiter was nice enough, but was not allowed to taste the bottle of wine that we brought, which was kind of a drag.  We never even smelled the somalier.  Where the eff was (s)he?

Finally, as we finished dinner and the wildly overpriced Chteau DY'quem, we were asked to move out to the frikken patio!  The restaurant was nowhere near full.  

Turns out, however, that last half an hour after dinner was the highlight of the meal:  we got to enjoy the water show, finish our wine and cast occasional glances at TV's own Tom Selleck sitting nearby.

Unlike meals that I have had at other fine establishments, looking back, nothing about Prime (other than the patio scene) stands out to me.

Here's the thing:  when dropping major coin of this sort, I expect to be dazzled.  Good does not cut it.  Prime just didn't dazzle me.Had dinner at prime at Saturday, way overpriced for the quality and taste, service was OK not excellent, I would say the best part of dinner was dessert and the bread, had the bone in filet medium rare and it was just ok have had much better steaks at other vegas steakhouses including delmonicos and delfriscos, I give it 3 stars only because of ambiance and location next to the lake, also the potato neoche was very goodGood place to go for an inexpensive snack after a night of partying or gambling as this place is open 24 hours. Inexpensive for Wynn, that is. Expect to pay over $10 for a sandwich and $5 for a drink. Everything here is convenient- the sandwiches come pre-made and are warmed to order in a convection oven; the salads come pre-made as well; the soups are in a large pot; and the desserts come from the refrigerator. The only thing that is made-to-order are the drinks from coffee to tea to smoothies. There's also frozen yogurt and various baked goods (cookies, brownies, etc). This cafe is convenient (reflective of its name)- you order at the counter, get your food and then find a place to sit. 

The food is pretty good, some items better than others. I've tried the Pepperoni Pizza Pocket, the Philly Cheesesteak, the Chili, the Asian Chicken Salad, and the Fruit Tart (Not all at the same time though!). My favorite was the Fruit Tart- a delicious pastry shell filled with pastry cream and topped with a beautiful arrangement of fruit (Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, pear, apple, lychee, pineapple, mango, kiwi...). It was a pretty good size for $8. 

But like I said, if you're hungry in the middle of the night, are stuck at the Wynn/Encore, and have no money because you gambled it all or spent it all on drinks at XS or Surrender, then this place will be your savior.We came here for breakfast and the food was more than decent, but not spectacular. VERY SLOW service. Our server was horrible. She had this funky look on her face. We thought that she was making faces, but realized that was her natural expression since she was like that with everyone else. Weird.

Had the sirloin benedict (instead of canadian bacon, it has sirloin pieces) which was different but still tasty. Hash browns were yummy. And the pancakes? I don't know what they did, but they were the tastiest most fluffiest pancakes I've had in awhile. Really great pancakes!!!A-OK is right and the hype is not always worth the wait. I will keep it simple since there are probably 500 reviews on the place.

Pros:

Great Hashbrowns, and made from scratch food

Good specials to keep things mixed up

Great company and service

Cons:

Guy up front says a little over 35 minutes but really means an hour and 45 minutes

Pricey for some dishes

Interesting people around while you wait to get inside (street walkers, etc.)

the fresh squeezed orange juice is enough liquid to maybe fill up a double shot glass

Overall I would love to give this place more stars if I could get in there without wanting to eat a finger due to starvation, and leave a bit more satisfied. Anyone who has eaten at Bryan's in San Diego would know what I mean.I went here last year when I was in AZ, I thought it was God's gift to Mexican food... I was a bit tipsy last year when I went there... I went again last week, it was "ehhhh". Don't get me wrong, still good, but not as wonderful as I remembered... not even close. 

We had to wait an hour for a table, the waiter made us wait about 15 minutes (not kidding) for water and chips/salsa... Seriously, 15 minutes? You dumbass! 

The desserts were super good though, that was the upside...Sadly this place is no longer open because Bill's Gamblin Hall will be transformed into an ultra chic hotel like the Centurian Tower in Caesars Palace was into the Nobu Hotel.

The Cafe was one of the last cheap eats on the strip and I'd walk past it all the time and forget it even existed. My family wanted to eat here because they had an affordable chinese menu and didn't want to pay high prices lunch at one of the bigger hotels. The style of the restaurant is Victorian (1837 - 1901)  thus being called Victorian Cafe with it's stained glass windows and wood paneling. The service was just average and the food was below average, we had the lunch specials that included dessert and was just bland in my opinion. 

I'd come back for cheap breakfast if the place was still open but not for the below average Chinese Food. 

 - Farewell Classic Las Vegas -This is conveniently tucked inside the Bellagio where we had our last lunch here with the crew. We noshed on dimsum since we were turned off by the buffet line and needed something fast. It didn't help that we had a large party with us but we were seated right away when a spot opened up for us. 

They do have dimsum carts here and even a full menu. We shared the roti prata appetizer and a few shrimp balls. We had the peking duck and bbq pork combination which came with steamed rice and greens. It was filling. Service was spotty and the food's expensive. 
For a quick dimsum meal, I'd come back here again. The food's decent.I wasn't quite sure how many stars to give this place so I went for the middle. Here's the reason why:

I love calamari. In fact, I consider myself a snob when it comes to this dish. Living in Las Vegas these past couple years, I was getting fearful I would never taste good calamari again. Then I went to Kahunaville! Awesome dish. I think what makes it soo good is the tangy sauce that comes with it. Yummie! Also, the drinks are not that bad either. I ordered a margharita specifically the way I like it (skinny girl style) and it was made perfectly. My friends also enjoyed the speciality drinks from the menu while we were there. 

However...
The speciality drinks were way overpriced. Also, while there for dinner with my friends (same mentioned above), we had a confusing and baffling experience which brings the rating of this place down in my mind. One of my friends is pregnate and therefore watching what she is eating. That night, she ordered the nachos, which she had been craving. When placing the order, she requested the peppers and olives be on the side. Also she asked that the gouda cheese not be included. When the dish came, it was exactly as described in the menu but not as she had ordered. Good thing she and her husband had also ordered a plate of chicken wings. The waitress was wonderful to take the plate of nachos back to the kitchen to get the order corrected. BUT she then returned w/. strange news-  the kitchen refused to change the order. 

I have never been to a restaurant that would not be willing to give a customer what they wanted. The cheeses apparently were pre-mixed. No problem for my friend. But the kitchen still refused to serve the peppers and olives on the side. My friend canceled the nachos order and instead decided to get french fries. A half hour later and the rest of us (a total of 6 people in our party) were finished with our plates and the fries had still not arrived. When all was said and done, my friends paid more for the 1 speciality drink (they got a free plastic cup- whoopie!) than for their meal-- one plate of chicken wings.

Therefore, I give this restaurant 3 stars:
Great calamari and margharita
Horrible kitchen service and overpriced drinks. Oh yeah- the plastic cup was tacky as well. 

My advice- only go here for the appetizers and a couple of drinks but nothing else.It about $25 a plate! but i had the Ribs and CHicken plate and it was pretty good a friend of mine had the crab cake and her portions were not to her satisfaction. We also ordered the wing appetizers and slider and they were BOMB!!! we also got free shots at the bar after the bar show so it was pretty entertaining and fun but we walked out of there with a $100 bill.Went here once for lunch, once for dinner on my last venture to Sin City back in January.  Decor is serene and relaxing, food was presented beautifully.  Service was very good.  Food was good but nothing extremely memorable.  It's difficult for even very good places to shine in vegas because there's such a glut of excellent restaurants.I'm not sure if my expectations were higher then they should be based on the reputation of Hubert Keller and my impressions of him on Top Chef Masters. The food is good, but nothing special, nothing that would make me want to come back again. When you take into consideration the price you are spending on Tapas (small plates), the food is not worth the high cost.

I had to pull a menu up to remember the dishes we had. Even so, I have a blurry memory at best of what we ate. It's nothing memorable, nothing super, nothing great, just ordinary food. I feel like i could go to an ordinary diner and get food like this every day of the week.I love the idea of tapas since I like to try everything so I made reservations here. We waited about 5 minutes before we were seated. Our waitress showed us the drink menu on the iPad and I ordered a blue ocean. We First ordered 5 dishes because we weren't sure how hungry we were. The waitress recommended about 2-3 per person. The ahi tuna tacos, calamari, and onion soup came out quick. The ahi tuna tacos were alright. Light and refreshing. The calamari was ok as well. Nothing special. I then tried and onion soup and it was thick and rich. Good...but rich!  We didn't finish the soup and decided to order the foie gras bases on recommendations on yelp.  After about 10 minutes our pork belly fried rice and lobster Mac and cheese came out. Maybe I'm biased because I'm Asian but the fries rice had way too much soy sauce in it. The pork belly also should have been cut up in smaller pieces instead of having big chunks all over. And i honestly did not like the lobster Mac and cheese. It tasted too concentrated with lobster. The lobster Mac and cheese at mastros is soooo much better. Don't get it here. Finally after a disappointing meal the foie gras came out. It was prepared two ways. The warm part of the duo was good, I wasn't feeling the other version of the duo. The wine ice cream on the dish was good. Lastly we ordered the beignets for dessert. It was good but not epic. It's like the same kind you get at Disneyland. 

Overall, the food is edible but definitely don't know what makes the food epic.It is an ok outlet mall. It has gotten much better over the past few years with their interior and outer remodel.  The stores have improved as well. There used to only be 2 stores I liked there, but now there are dozens I enjoy. 

If you do go, stop by the customer service desk in the food court to pick up a coupon book. They are free if you have an AAA or AARP membership card. Otherwise I think they are $5, but usually worth it.  The staff will let you look at it first to see if the stores you want are in the book.It is a really nice club, but they are super strict with who they let in. I did not like waiting in a big crowd of people to be hand chosen by the bouncers to be let in the club. It was nice though after I finally got in. The drinks are pretty expensive too, but I will go here again because of the nice ambiance.Nothing is really special about this club. The vibe was not high energy like other clubs in Vegas. It is a waste to come here because Vegas can offer a lot better. The music was pretty ghetto.A major drawback is the stale smell of the dining room.  My meal would probably have been a lot more enjoyable if I got to eat in the outdoor patio.

It's a good place, however, to take a mixed group - there's something for everyone - gyros and shwarmas for carnivores, Med platter (hummus, baba, tsaziki, tabouleh, falafel) for vegetarians.  Portions are generous - especially the lentil and rice side which was as big if not bigger than the mains.  Food hits the table fast and the prices are reasonable - no wonder this place is always packed.Not fancy indeed, but a good environment to have some drinks. 

I only got shocked to order a Piña Colada and was denied. After that  the bartender offered he could prepare any cocktail (except Piña Colada). Anyway, I did got a chance to try other shots and enjoy all the time the good attention.The Pyramid Cafe is your typical 24 hour cafe inside the Luxor.  You can find breakfast, lunch, and dinner items throughout the day or night here.  Most of the food is consistent and the service is also good.  IMHO this isn't the best place to grab a bite inside the Luxor, however, if your short on time and can't get in line at the Deli; the cafe is for you.I would give this roller coaster four stars if not for the price. $14 for one ride? Really? I must be dumb, because I went for it anyways. The first half of the ride is great, but it loses steam on the second half (read: gravity). You go through the standard loop, barrels, upside down twists, etc, but for some reason this ride is really jerky.

If you haven't been on too many roller coasters this might be something you'll want to try, especially since its a) in Las Vegas, and b) it wraps around and through the NY NY casino. My recommendation is to go on the ride after you have digested your last meal and not drink too much before getting on. Still, $14 is steep for just one ride.This was a good family show. And for the price I would recommend it. My 4 year old loved all the animals. Although the pets weren't trained very well it was overall a good show to see if you have kidsTheir white peach crepes are pretty good. It's not a bad place to go for breakfast after 11am. It won't be a cheap breakfast though.I heard a lot of good things about Sardine, but I don't believe it lived up to my expectations.

My favorite part of my dining experience here was the appetizer we ordered. The sardines were pretty good. For the entree, a friend of mine recommended the roasted half chicken, but it ended up being just okay. This might be harsh, but I would've enjoyed a rotisserie chicken just as much. My fiancee ordered the steamed mussels, which came with frites and dipping sauce. However, I ended up enjoying the frites a lot more than the mussels.

I liked the atmosphere here and the service was good, but the food was decent as best.Unfortunately I have to knock Ticoz down a star after my glowing review; I went back this week and as of this Monday, they have discontinued their bar menu!!!! WHY TICOZ WHY!??!?! It was my absolute favorite thing about the restaurant and the half off appetizers that they now have for their HH pales in comparison (not to mention the fact that their bar menu was available from 4 pm-close, not just 4-6:30). 

I am deeply saddened by this turn of events. I'll probably still go to Ticoz because their food is good but I will always miss the good ol' days of two delicious tacos for $5.95. RIP Ticoz Bar Menu.As others alluded to Capital Grille is an upscale steak restaurant. This restaurant hangs its hat on fine steak dining. 

Considering how many restaurants are all over the strip of Las Vegas - it was quite a sight when the whole place was packed with patrons.

I had a company dinner here so we shared:

-Lobster mac n cheese - I've had better. It would've been nice if the lobster flavor was stronger. I've had better lobster mac n cheese in NY where we would get chunks of lobster. It tasted like ordinary mac n cheese with the lobster absent from the dish
-Au Gratin Potatoes - average
-Lobster and Crab Cake - served with a sweet corn relish this crabcake was on par with most crab cake but we hardly tasted any lobster
-Pan Fried Calamari with Hot Cherry Peppers - the hot cherry peppers was a nice spin to the calamari but the batter was too thick on the calamari
-French Green Beans with Shallots and Heirloom Tomatoes - nice but the green beans were a bit stiff
-Parmesan Truffle Fries - the skirt fries were overfried and you could hardly taste any truffle - again - i've had better

and I ordered the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-year Aged Balsamic  - The balsamic really stood out which was the purpose of the dish but i was rather disappointed that without the balsamic  - the steak was rather bland.

Capital Grille is a chain of upscale steak but I would much prefer McCormick and Schmidt over Capital GrilleFormally called, "The Oz Buffet," the MGM Buffet is a step lower than the Bellagio, Wicked Spoon, and Bachannal Buffet.  To me, it looks like an upscale Hometown Buffet with premium eats.  

I bought a comp buffet pass from playing MyVegas and decided to give it a try since I'm always eating in the pricey buffets. The Buffet is located right on the left side of the casino by the strip entrance and across from Rain Forest Cafe.

My buffet pass was only good for lunch and I made it a mission to make it all the way from the Cosmopolitan on time before they switched to dinner. =D

The food they serve here is typical in any other Vegas Buffet, like: Italian, Asian, Mexican, Seafood, Meat Station, Middle Eastern, and Japanese. Overall the food was just average and the customer service was on top of it's game. The surroundings weren't fancy or eye catching, just plain boring. No, "Wow Factor" at all.

I expected better from MGM, since it's one of the biggest hotels in the Las Vegas and the world. They need to step up their game or they'll just end up being mediocre, like the Excalibur and Luxor Buffets. I'd sure eat here again, only if it were free.Food is pretty good bit parking is a nightmare!I would give the service one star. I went there twice on my stay and both times it took way too long to get any type of service.

However, I would give 5 stars to the meal I had! Perhaps it was the fact that I was starved or perhaps it was the alcohol, but I had, no exaggeration, the best meal I have ever had in my entire life!

I can only attest to the things I personally ate. The Half-pound Angus burger was amazing! I ordered it medium-well so it wasn't very pink (just the way I like it) and it came with an order of fries. The $15 price tag is a bit hefty but I don't feel like my money was wasted. Even the ranch was incredible! 

Since it's Vegas, we were not ashamed to also order the Bananas Foster Waffle. Holy crap! It was sweet and caramel-y and wonderful! Had a fly fallen on the waffle, I would've devoured his disease-ridden body along with it!

I ate well past the point of fullness, simply because the food was delicious. Why 3 stars then? The service. The waitress wasn't rude; just didn't really give us refills or our food in a timely manner. 

Great food and bad service averages to about 3 stars. If you want great food for Cheesecake Factory prices in Vegas, I would highly recommend this place.I needed to get some food mid-afternoon (yes, I had only been up a couple of hours..) and found myself at the Bellagio.  Since none of their Michelin-starred restaurants were open yet, I ducked into the Cafe.  

I had the chicken salad sandwich with kettle chips and a latte.  The chicken salad sandwich came on a pretzel bun which was a little dense for my liking, but it was fine.  The chicken salad itself was pretty ok.  The latte.. also ok, no problems there.  The chips were insanely salty - I think this is a Vegas thing, everything is salty there, encouraging you to drink more.. thus gamble more.. well, that's my theory anyway, as I have noticed that things are salty everywhere.

Service was nice, and the price was fine.  Overall, no issues with this place - I was hungry and needed to wake up, and it delivered.  A-OK.This is a local Arizona institution, so I am scared to give it 3 stars...but dammit, this site is about honesty, right? 

My brother has tried to take me to an Oregano's for a while, but there is always an insane wait at whatever one we have attempted. Since it was an early weekday afternoon, I suggested this new one in Mesa since there was bound NOT to be a wait-and we were right!

We entered and this place is pretty spacious. They asked if we wanted to eat at the bar-but to tell the truth it looked like on of the most unappealing bars I had ever seen. It reminded me of the Barbie's McDonald play set I had as a kid. Plastic-y and just kind of kitchy-and not in the good way. No thanks. We were led through the restaurant and I have to admit it reminded me of a Pizza Hut. Hmm... we opted for outside but kind of regreted it since it was hot out and the misters didn't do much.

The table was kind of large and I felt like my bro and I were at a conference table waiting for a terribly important meeting. The host was friendly and wanted our drink order kind of fast-but since it was my first time, I told him that. He then proceeded to tell me ALL the drinks. I mean ALL of them. I wished I had kept my mouth shut and just found the last page of the menu that listed drinks, since he proceeded to list them off verbatim. While he sat at our table. Kind of awkward. Am I being too east coast about this? After all that, got a Fat Tire and then proceeded to look over the menu. As a vegetarian and lactose intolerant, going to Italian restaurants is kind of dumb for me, I admit. I mean I can eat pizza, but it just doesn't bode well. 

I settled for the Pasta Basta, penne with feta cheese, pine nuts, olives, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, olive oil and with a slice of garlic bread. It was a little spicy, but pretty tasty and not a bad deal for 8 bucks. I had some left over and the garlic bread toasted well the day after.

I just wasn't super impressed. It was a good solid restaurant, one you could bring grandman, your ma, a study group, kids, whatever, which is nice, right? But I found the service to be way too familiar and way too friendly (which sounds crazy, and trust me, I didnt think that was possible until I went here). I understood finally why children are scared of clowns after coming here. Someone being overly nice and cheerful is just kind of eerie.Holy pizza selection.  This place looks like a mad food scientist designed the menu.  I counted at least 26 types of pie.  I couldn't get a good count, it was busy.  
I went the the Mac & Cheese pizza.  You don't see that style often (exactly one time for me) and it's Wisconsin Cheese baby.  Let's just say it wasn't that good.  
The crust was flat, with no real texture, and the mac n cheese lacked flavor.
I want to like this place, I will try again.A relaxing Sunday early evening and it's time for dinner.  Suggestions are for Famous Dave's BBQ and off we go.  

It wasn't busy for this Easter Sunday, surprisingly.  It took about ten to fifteen minutes for our table to be ready for our party of nine.  

Tonya, our waitress started us off with drinks.  The majority of our party started with Southern Sweet Tea.  It was yummy, but not quite as good as the stuff I had in Georgia or at Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ.

I was torn between the Sweetwater Catfish Fingers and the Texas Beef Brisket, so I ended up with both, the Two-Meat Combo! It automatically comes with corn-on-the cob, corn bread muffin, and a choice of two sides.  Although the breaded catfish was a bit tasty, I was a bit disappointed in the size of the fingers.  Indeed, they are definitely 'fingers' and are small strips of fish.  They come with two sauces - a Sweet Soul Jalapeno and remoulade.  I found the remoulade to be more enjoyable than the other sauce.    The brisket was less than what I expected and a bit dry.  I wouldn't order it again.  My two sides were Drunkin' Apples and Garlic Red-Skin Mashed Potatoes.  The apples were nothing special with cinnamon sprinkled on it, but the mashed potatoes were good.

The BF opted for the Rib-N-Meat Combo, which included bone spareribs and a choice of a hot link, wings, catfish, or any of the other meats offered.  He went for the hot link.  He got a hearty portion of spareribs and they were definitely a lot tastier than my dish.  The hot link was okay though.

They have about seven different sauces to choose from at your table - Devil's Spit, Georgia Mustard,  Hot & Sassy, Smokey Chipotle, Rich & Sassy,  Sweet & Zesty, and Texas Pit.

They don't offer that many sides to choose from - Potato Salad, Creamy Coleslaw,  Wilbur Beans, Famous Fries, and Firecracker Green Beans (w/bacon) are the only other choices.

If you do end up with leftovers, be sure to ask for a few containers to take home the sauces with.  They have a few sauces packaged to go, otherwise you can squeeze some into those plastic containers.

Service was good.  Tonya was pretty good with bringing lots of refills of our Sweet Tea because she knew we were thirsty things.  It saved us the trouble of having to ask her for more and she was one step ahead of the game.

Overall, Famous Dave's was just okay in my book.  My brisket and catfish were disappointing, but the spareribs were more enjoyable.  They do have my Sweet Tea, but it wasn't sweet enough.  My order was less than stellar, it was alright.  It's a chain restaurant located in almost every state except 11 of them!  They must be doing alright then!love dicks, richardsons etc etc but come on I'm throwing down 120$ get some  servers / managers with customer service skills.Not being a big fan of Chinese food myself, I decided to humor my partner in crime and try something of her choosing this Friday evening. After hearing my parents and food snob brother rant about the one in Avondale, I figured being a chain, it couldn't be much worse (or better) at this location.

Since I was hungry (having not eaten all day due to my sensitive piercing [see my review for HTC]) we ordered 2 apps (edamame and the chicken lettuce wraps), for our entrees she had the Kung Pao chicken while I had the Thai coconut curry shrimp.

The edamame came out pretty quickly, but were kinda "over-reheated" although fairly tasty. The lettuce wraps were OK. While the lettuce was great and very crisp and fresh, the chicken mixture was a little overdone and underseasoned. I've had better lettuce wraps at BJ's, to be totally honest.

Out came the entrees and again, nothing special, but not bad. The chicken in her entree was, again, a little overcooked but not enough to make it inedible...I personally thought they were a little stingy with the peanuts, but the flavor was OK. Enough heat to make the dish enjoyable but not hot enough that you would start sweating profusely.

My coconut curry shrimp smelled delicious and tasted the same. They definitely aren't stingy with the protein in either entree we tried. My only gripe with my entree was that it came out a little on the cool side, and without seeing any visible peppers, the seasoning throughout was a little inconsistent...a few bites would have no heat at all, then I'd fish out a shrimp and chomp away and I'd be in tears due to the spice.

So, I wouldn't say it was good enough to change my opinion of Chinese food, but it was definitely a nice change of pace and I would go back again. 4 stars down to 3 as the cashier/order taker was a little snotty and impatient for my taste.Comfort food...something a little different than Aloha Specialties upstairs.

Came here yesterday w/my parents for lunch. I thought I was in a restaurant at the Ala Moana Center or something. The place was busy but we only waited 10 minutes before we were seated. Dad ordered the Island rib and mom ordered the battered orange roughy  from their Saturday menu while I ordered a cheese burger w/fries which was actually bigger and tasted better than I expected. Our meal came in at just under $27. The service was ok...waitress took our drink order and waiter took our food order. Once we finished our meals I thought about ordering dessert but no one came back to our table to ask if we wanted any since the check was left at our table while we were eating. I supposed I should have spoken up when the check was dropped off but I had a mouthful of cheese burger at the time. 

I would come back again but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.This place confuses me.  You walk in, and think that this is a pretty decent sports bar.  Then you get up to go the bathroom, and see all the hidden rooms and lounge areas.  I don't understand it, is it for the people who get bucket of beer service?  Why do you need to section it off?  Is it a club later at night?

Food was pricier than it should have been for a half-assed sports bar.  And there was no creativity in the menu, which there should be for the prices!  This place gets a pass.Quick and simple works sometimes, especially when it's tasty-enough.

Thai Vegas qualifies under all three.  They offer 14 great lunch specials with meat dishes in a variety of Thai sauces and a side of rice (and a spring roll and salad/soup).  The sauces available include curry, hot chili, mint chili and lots more--Pad Thai's also an option  The dishes aren't over-the-top amazing, but they're tasty enough to bring you back week after week for the lunch special.We went for lunch on a Sunday, because it would be more casual and cheaper.  I didn't expect a lame metal detector when you get in.

The restaurant spins very slowly, and takes something like an hour and a half to fully rotate.  I can't imagine getting dizzy because of this, but with enough wine, I guess anyone could.  Obviously everything is pricey.  I don't think the food was amazing enough to be priced that way, but it was very good nonetheless.  

The view was great, I imagine its really great at night as well.  There are crazy rides on top of the building, so occasionally you see a glimpse of people flying around above you.  Service was impeccable, and we ended up staying almost two hours.  Glad to have gone, but probably wouldn't go back.cool views up top, but food kinda sucks since it's not even considered fine dining. some food may look good, but don't taste very good, do not order seafood; think about it, why would you order seafood in a desert?We went there for lunch and the view was what made the experience. 

FOOD:  
I had the Crabcakes.  It was spendy, but it was nice and lite.  Everything else on the menu looked heavy and more for a Winter meal.  

DRINKS:  
We didn't get drunk, because the drinks were so expensive.  But, they had a nice full selection to choose from. 

SERVICE:  
The service was okay.  We didn't have to pay to go up in the elevator, since we were eating at the restaurant.  

ATMOSPHERE:  
The view from the revolving restaurant is what made the experience fun.  After lunch, we went out on the terrace and enjoyed the view and watched the rides that were at the top.  We didn't go on the rides because they seemed so insane.  

WOULD I GO THERE AGAIN?:  
Sure, I would go there again, just for the view.  The food was adequate, but the view made our experience fun.This is probably fantastic BBQ for many but not those that are from the heart of BBQ country. I'm still in search of GREAT BBQ. Where do I find pork cooked long & slopped with sauce the whole time its being burnt with fire? Uber tired of smoked meat with little to no flavor and sweet sauce. The sides here are really good but I'm still in search of bbq like you find down South & Kansas City. The atmosphere is great and I was so excited to eat here because Joe's Farm Grill is so unbelievably good. If people turn there head like a confused dog (and EVERY PHX BBQ joint has so far) when you ask them for chopped outside, they have NO business being in the BBQ business.Good bang for buck food. Nothing to brag about and nothing special compared to other restaurants. 

Ordered the big plate for two to share with my gilrfriend. Anahilated the food mostly due to hunger but the food is reasonably priced and the service was fantastic.Tried the gyro, it wasn't bad but it wasn't special IMO.  It was a good price, about $5.50 I think, which may be why I was still a little hungry afterwards.  I guess a $8-9 gyro should have almost twice as much meat, but even taste vs taste, I probably wouldn't come here again for a gyro.

I did not try any other food there though, which I am sure would have been good.  Maybe one day I will be more brave and try new med food.

Another tiny complaint, we came in on a weekend around lunchtime 130-2pm, and we were the only people there, even after we were done with our food.  After we ordered, the owners or people working the front disappeared and I never saw them after they dropped off the food.  They didn't ask how the food was, and we didn't have the chance to say thank you, since they left and never came back out LOLOk Ive eaten here twice now once before they expanded and again today.  I like the layout with the bar, outdoor seating and plenty of indoor space so you dont feel like people are piled on top of you like some breakfast joints.  My wife had the benedict with spinach and side of bacon which turned out to be the best part of her meal as she requested the eggs without runny whites which is basically what she received.  I was a little disappointed with the Huevos Rancheros the flavor was ok but nothing impressed me.  We ordered the Arizona Fire Corn because it sounded interesting and found the flavor to be good here however they charge $3.29 for a few tablespoons of this side; a little to proud if you ask me.  On a positive note our server was very good which helped the average food until our bill hit the table.  $41.50 and another $8.00 for tip we were out the door at $50 for two breakfasts, 2 Ice Teas and a couple of very small sides we wanted to try.  I like this place just dont love it but the location is great so what the heck maybe we'll give it another chance next time where in the area.Tex-Mex in an airport.  Nothing amazing to note.  The food was actually better than I expected.We ate Saturday around 4 and were seated immediately, service was very good and he waitress was awesome, even teaching my wife how to eat an artichoke.
The restaurant was clean and presentable and the hostesses greeted us entering and leaving.
A little on the expensive side, but they did have reasonable dishes as long as you stay away from steak/lobster menu.  We had gift cards for $90 and still spent another $60 with Tip(20% $25)......this included:
3 ($9) drinks, tri-tip slider appetizer ($6.99), artichoke appetizer ($9), Ribeye and Lobster meal ($50) with mushrooms ($2.99)  and Tri-Tip and Shrimp Meal (21.99).  


I didn't find any of the dishes overly greasy or salty. The tri-tip was very good and the sliders had a hint of Poblano that was great.  My rib eye was one of the best I've had, but the Lobster I added on for $21.99 was tough and had no flavor.  we didn't send it back, I shouldn't have to for a $50 meal.  A great dinner, but not one I would pay for out of my own account...thank god for gift cards:)This office is efficient and the lines move quick, as long as it is not on a Monday or Friday. During the middle of the week is usually the best time to go, if you want to avoid long wait times. The staff is friendly.went to this location this past weekend.... omg last time i was in vegas it was delicious....

this time... ummm it was ok... we got there @ 10:40 am (lunch time doesnt start till 11am) 

by the time the waitress came it was 10:50am.... my husband ordered breakfast(he was still on time)...


and my friend and i wanted lunch.... the waitress said we had to wait till 11....??? :/  its like 10 min. till 11 like blah....


we had to settle for breakfast... :( 

the eggs were blah and the tortillas felt kinda old...... 


 but i got my self a yard margarita(yes @ 11am)  and i didnt even get drunk :( it tasted as if it didnt have alchol boo woo :(Now that they've opened a Q'doba in Old Town, we don't come to this location very often.  However, they seem to make larger sized portions at this one.  The Queso Sauce is still very addicting....I crave it from time to time.

We come to this location when we don't feel like driving to Old Town and dealing with the late night tomfoolery down there.  This one is situated in a normal shopping area.  As long as it stays open, we'll keep coming back.

Return Factor - 80%Absolutely beautiful venue, but the music wasn't to my liking. We got on the guest list by hanging out in the Mirage casino during the day. It was cool to watch the visual effects throughout the club, including interactive tables and led displays/projections on the wall. I'd try it again and hope for better music.I had no idea about the history of the original Rao's when I came here with a group of people for dinner, though one in our party - the one who had tried fruitlessly for years to eat at the original one - was kind enough to tell us about the famed sauce and meatballs. 

Since he was the one with all the expectations, seeing him finally eat the meatballs and the enormous veal parmesan and not be underwhelmed was nice, as high expectations can ruin that dream meal.  The special seasonal pasta - purses with blue cheese, pears and cranberries in a sage butter sauce - was tasty, though the lemon chicken my friend ordered seemed to be *the* dish.  Our waiter was one of those old school guys, who'd been working at the high end restaurants in Vegas since the days of Frank and Sammy, and he certainly added to the ambiance, since the schizophrenic music selection (Christmas, Motown and a bit of Italian thrown in for measure) didn't do much.

And outside a small misunderstanding on the wine order where the sommelier gal opened up a bottle about 4x the price of the one we ordered, it was enjoyable, if a bit overpriced for the food and ambiance.  But hey, it's Vegas, right?Had dinner here right when they opened for dinner, so the place was pretty empty and the wait was short.  Ordered an appetizer to share between me and one other person, a pasta each, and a glass of wine each. The food was mediocre...my friend ordered the ravioli with cranberries, which was much better than the penne vodka I ordered.

Probably wouldn't come back here...food was just ok and extremely overpriced.After hearing critics' praise on this new restaurant via the local radio, I came into Vintner Grill with high expectations. I really wanted to love this place. After finally experiencing it, however, I left scratching my head as to what the hype was all about. Did I miss the kool aid on the way in? In all honesty, the food was not terrible. But for the price, it also didn't wow me. The food was so uneventful I even forgot what I had. I ordered the calamari as an appetizer and the seared scallops for my entree. 

On a positive note, the decor of the place is quite elegant. It's a great place to people watch as dinner is a packed house and the folks who come in here appear dressed to the nines. As for the food, I'm gonna keep on moving.By the prices they were charging, I would have expected a meal that tasted less like reheated Olive Garden doused in parmesan. 

On the plus side it appeared to be 40-something-divorcee's night at the bar next door... so that was entertaining.I tried going here to use my Groupon earlier this week but they were closed for renovation. They're changing their name too. Bummer - I wish they updated their web site that they would be closed.My wife is Filipino and I have been over there a number of times, mostly in Cebu City, but also Manila and a few other places. Barrio Fiesta is a known name there, at least in Manila, but I have to say this place is different than what one would experience in the Philippines. 

Of course, it is not possible to get all of the ingredients here, so I guess we should cut them some slack. But other Filipino places do a better job, so that is not the entire reason. 

I've been here at least half a dozen times, and each visit is a different experience. One time we will be pleasantly surprised and hasten back, only to find the quality has gone down hill. I have to assume that the quality depends a lot on which chef is working that particular day. The service is generally good, however, and I like it a lot better now that they serve San Miguel Beer. Prices are okay, maybe a little high--though we tend to order a lot when we visit. 

I would say this place is worth a visit, but don't neglect some of the other Filipino restaurants in town.Honestly, I'm torn.  The wings were super delicious.  We like "hot" and they came through.  Moist with the right amount of sauce.  We also ordered the Philly steak flatbread entree.  It was really delicious and came out nice and hot, but the size is more of an appetizer for two rather than an entree. 

The service on the other hand was lacking.  It appeared they only had two people in the whole bar, which would make sense why my boyfriend had to get up from our table and walk to the bar to order another round of drinks and then again for our food and again for the bill.  The server was nice enough, but I don't recommend going on a weeknight if you would like service.  Also, do NOT go on Tuesdays unless you want to hear some DJ doing the worst team trivia night ever.  He was way too fast and not even in visual range.  He did stop to say hello, but then started taking random pictures of people (including us) to post on his blog.  I believe he needs permission legally to do so.  

I will go back for the food, but it will not be during "off" hours.Always a fan of Claim Jumper.  I am disappointed with some of the menu changes since CJ's was bought out by Landry's.  The service is usually pretty good.  There is nothing phenomenal about the restaurant, but it is still good food...although a but pricey for some items ...$4.99 for a cup of soup is a bit steep for the portion size.  We tend to eat in the bar where it's a bit more relaxed.  Just avoid the bar on Friday nights as the Zappos crowd is a bit loud. They are not obnoxious...just loud...and it slows down service a bit. 

Menu favorites: all of the salads, potato cheese soup, pretzel sticks, gigantic club sandwich, chicken/mashed potato/cinnamon apple dish (PLEASE BRING BACK THIS DISH WITH PORK!!!)Came to try the Tom Yum Gai & Thai tea. Service was very friendly, my food came out quickly. Ordered my food to go, so maybe my experience will be different when I eat there. 

 Soup was very good, was very happy with this. Flavors were perfect, could have had more chicken though since I got the pot for two but only enough chicken for one. 
My Thai tea was the disappointment. For the price I feel a kid sized cup is not appropriate. Would have rated higher except for this.I have no real complaints about this buffet.  It was decent (way better than the buffet at the Luxor, even though the food was similar).  I wouldn't seek this one out, but if you are staying here, then it's worth the convenience for breakfast.I usually only come to this Harkins for their IMAX 3D but now that I know there's an AMC Deer Valley that also have IMAX 3D I will probably not come to this theatre again.
Parking is hard to find here for me then there is a long walk plus it's right next to the food court so it's noisy and filled with loud teenagers which is great if you are a teenager.  Not so great if you are looking for a relaxing time or some peace and quiet.
It's also next to Gameworks~ you get the picture, this theatre in the midst of teenage hangouts is best suited for teenagers.
It is a Harkins, with the Harkins quality so once you walk into the actual theatre area, the place is spacious and clean with good sound quality and comfort.
There are lots of Harkins around Phoenix, this is not one of go to Harkins of choice.Fuego is indeed hidden but not too hard to find, and not really the gem it has been labeled.  After several visits to explore the menu and sample the dishes described by other critics as wonderful, I would have to politely disagree. The Latin description actually translates to Southwestern/Mexican.  The food itself is not bad, but it is nothing exceptional from any other Southwest grill. They do know how to correctly grill a steak, but most dishes under whelm, and the over-use of chipotle sauce is many dishes is a poor substitute for seasoning skill in the kitchen. Service is fair enough, drinks are good but still not exceptional. Here is the downside -this restaurant has two seating areas, not counting the outdoor patio. One is separated from the kitchen and bar area, and has reasonable ambience. The second dining area has the bar and kitchen access. Waiters are constantly running through it, out the door, and around to the other dining area. As a result it is distracting and quite noisy. A couple announced that they were celebrating their wedding anniversary and asked their server to take their picture, which she happily obliged after asking the kitchen staff to stop running past their table.  I felt sorry for them.  On the upside, it is not a chain or cookie-cutter place and has plenty of opportunity to improve.  A rating of 3 is really quite fair all things considered. Overall it can be a fair to very poor experience for dining.Good. 
Watch out for GIANT portions. If you have an app - split an entree. Unless you're starving. 
Service was decent. By that I mean - our server was wonderful, but the hostess that made the rez was m-yeh. 
I tried the chips w bleu cheese (good if a bit greasy), he had the tuna tartare (overpowered by the sesame chip, but fun to eat).
He had the bbq chicken pizza, I had the crispy chicken milanese. The pizza was a surprising combo, it was good, but it did get slightly soggy, too much sauce maybe? I loved the salad that came with mine it was wonderful, if a bit over dressed. Arugula, spinach, various baby tomatoes (heirloom?), and parmesan. The chicken was good but a little salty, and though our waitress said she loved the sauce it wasn't my fav, which is fine, there was a bit of lemon to squeeze over the chicken, it worked. And - I had to leave a whole piece of chicken. Too much food, and when you have a thing about food going to waste...Was looking for a place to get a gourmet sandwich and a beer.  I guess you can't really go wrong in anywhere in Vegas except for the prices.  

I enjoyed my roast beef sandwich:  My sandwich was: Roast Beef Panini, Sourdough Baguette, Horseradish Aioli, Watercress, Smoked Gouda, Hand Cut Potato Chips. 

My wife ordered the Chicken Salad Sandwich, Cherry-Pecan Bread, Alfalfa Sprouts, Mixed Organic Lettuces and thought it was amazing.Decent service and a large menu. A good place to go for beer fans when you're out of town and in good-beer voids like Phoenix.

I had the Hawaiian Poke stack, which was okay. Not sushi restaurant level but edible.Went to Fremont to do the Zip Line Thingy.. The same time I've heard and been wanting to try their Guilty Pleasures - Fried Twinkie and Fried Oreos..

Fried Twinkie: I like twinkies cause they are simple, nostalgic and just a nice fun treat. Now Deep Fried.. Umm, I think it was too over the top. It was fat, greasy/oil heavy, soft and sweet.. Like a donut filled with cream and surrounded by batter. It was ok.

Fried Oreo: same difference as the fried twinkie but I thought it was better. This was more like a donut hole with an oreo stuffed inside it. The slight crunch of the oreo gives it some depth and that familiar chocolatey oreo goodness. This was pretty good.

Defintiely not for the faint of heart munchers but I say its worth trying at least once!Spent 30 min browsing the various vendors on a cool Saturday morning.  Variety of produce is not that great and the quality of greens did not match the price in my opinion. Plenty of people were shelling out for produce though, so to each his own. I was more interested to see what local vendors are around. There are a couple of food trucks that I might stick around for next time. Free parking is a plus.  They should try to grow the market out some more to make it more fun and time-worthy.I like this place and would come back however my loyalties lie with either Mother's (also on Spring Mountain) and Min Sok Chon (near UNLV). I think DJK is a little more pricey...don't get me wrong, their food is good but if I can eat the same exact thing for cheaper, I will.Having grown up in Phoenix, but spent my grown up years in San Francisco, I was surprised to find a little sushi place that was so similar to those SF while visiting family. 
 It wasn't THE best sushi, but it was darn good. And the people who worked there were very nice. We had 6 of us, including the 2 kids, and they accommodated us in their small restaurant nicely. It was definitely worth the visit and I would go back when craving maguro or a Phili Roll. 
 The Las Vegas roll was a bit disappointingly bland. I guess the frying drained the flavor. And the green tea ice cream was odd tasting. Almost like vanilla ice cream with a fake green tea flavoring.

But I do recommend Hana.Pretty good sushi. Great for just a fun outing. Nice prices. Family owned too. Stop in if you just want decent sushi, good prices, and good service. Not five stars, but pretty good. Try it you may very well like it. Chase out!I still love Phoenix Muni but I don't love their concessions. While at a game tonight, they ran out of hot dogs, chicken tenders and even spoons. They didn't seem prepared for the crowds even though it was a sold out game. Poor Phoenix Muni.Man, I totally love the food at this place. The difficult part is when you are ordering takeout. Every single time I call in they mess up my order and have even charged my card twice for a dinner I had bought. Make sure when you eat here you are paying attention to what they are doing.My wife and I attended this club after reading the positive reviews on Yelp. Yes, the performers were amazing to look at, but the entertainment value was sorely lacking. The choreographer missed the boat on this one. The music was painfully loud - to the point of covering your ears at some points. They try to capture the essence of the famous French clubs by piping in old static-y soundtracks and having the dancers lip-synch the French lyrics. It comes across as clumsy and amateurish. 

Although it was fun to see the dancers, the artsiness constantly got in the way of the show... they would project distracting geometric patterns onto the performers with the net result being you couldn't really see much of the performers - that sort of defeats the purpose of the show, doesn't it?

At one point, there was a skit with two guys doing a breakdance/robot sort of routine. My initial reaction was 'What's with the GUYS on the stage?" but they were awesome and a true highlight of the evening. Again, not what you expect when you take in a show like this. 

The best tip I can share is to NOT pay full-price. Instead, go to the Half-Price night of show ticket stores along the strip. For $30/ticket, it's worth the experience, but I wouldn't be happy if I paid twice that for this mediocre show. Also, keep in mind that drinks are pricey - $9/beer, but the utlra-fine-print on their menus indicates that an 18% tip is already included in that price. I mistakenly tipped on top of that and felt taken.There's nothing like being at a resort complete with tons of water activities like a slide, lazy river, etc. when it's pouring in Phoenix!

Here with the hubby for a conference. The service was nice, grounds were nicely landscaped, and the desert is always nice.  However, without the warm Phoenix sun, there was very little to do.  The comfort of the bed helped to make up for the lack of things to do.  I would have killed for an indoor jacuzzi though, and a nice-sized tub.

If I had kids, I'd want to go here, but being one of the DINKs (double income, no kids), there's no real reason to stay here again.A good buffet. Not thee best I've ever been to but good nonetheless. I went for a wedding reception (there were about 3 wedding parties going on), so I have no idea what the price was. 

The place itself is nice. Maybe because it's not located directly off the strip. 

The food was your typical buffet food ranging from american to italian, mexican to chinese. They also have a sushi bar and a gelato bar!

I probably won't be back, just because I usually stay on the strip..but it was nice to try something new.I have been to this buffet on several occasions. 

The food is ok, but I'm not really a big fan of buffets. The only thing I like about them is the endless choices of beverages and a plethora of dessert options, two things I usually don't order when I go to a regular sit down restaurant. 

I came here for my friend's rehearsal dinner and they were very good about accomodating such a large group of people. The service was good and it's a good option when you have a huge group of people with different food preferences, so I would highly recommend this place for larger groups as well. 

All in all, it's a pretty good buffet for the price, if you're into that sort of thing. =)Just got back from the Blue Agave....I have to say, at first I was shocked in the menu to see wraps and burgers listed, and I almost freaked out, because my dad and his girlfriend are in from Rhode Island and wanted to go to a nice Mexican restaurant. I was thinking to myself I heard this was a Mexican restaurant, and I thought I was going to almost cower into a corner somewhere for making such a poor dinner choice. However, as I looked on the back of the menu, there were some old tried and true favorites of this Latin cuisine, fajita's, enchilada's and the like. I did pretty much gasp (to myself of course, I wasn't paying  for the meal) at the prices. For this genre of food, I was surprised that the meals ranged from $10 a plate and up. In my eyes, that is ridiculous. But they do give you an ungodly amount of food, and it is stuff you can reheat again that actually tastes good. This is my reasoning for giving this establishment only three stars. In my mind, there are cheaper Mexican restaurants with food just as good if not better. I thought the decor was interesting, but there is no real level of ambiance here. If you are looking for that you have the wrong place. It almost reminds me of a very hip college hang out. The waiter we had was fantastic and very attentive. I can appreciate the fact he did not call me Ma'am, as I am sensitive now that I am 30. I have mixed feelings on whether or not I would return. I do agree with the gentleman who said it was 'eh....I think there are a lot more fantastic restaurants in the area I need to frequent before I go to this one again. It remains to be seen is all I can say.Trader Joe's is my steady dealer that gives me a straight shot of Kashi when I need it most.  So, how is it that Kashi costs 33 cents more in Madison, Wisconsin than it does in San Francisco, California?  Bah-humbug.

Overall, this t-joes is like most other t-joes.  Quality stuff at ok-prices if you have trial-and-error patience ... though you'll be lucky if its still in product-rotation the next time you return.  

Yes-yes's include pizza dough, greek yogurt, walnuts, dried montmorency cherries, unsulfured-oh-ya apricots, hummus, valrhona chocolate, frozen green beans, moochi ice cream, stone ground crackers, bubbily waters, and macaroons.  

No-no's include produce, OJ, chips, TJ brand chocolates, cheeses, wine, most of their overpriced frozen dinners.We love Peruvian food and were really looking forward to this meal due to the good reviews; however, our meal was fine but nothing special.

The Ceviche was too tart completely overpowering the taste of the fish. Peruvian ceviche comes in varied tastes. This one was low on our list.

We shared an enormous portion of Jalea Inka which was fried mixed seafood. For $27 you could easily share among 3 people. The dish consisted of tons of varied seafood...mussels, filet, squid, shrimp and it was nicely breaded but the dish was just not flavorful. A terrific value, but don;t expect to be overwhelmed by the flavor.

The Chicha morada was sweet and good and the service was very good.Pampas is one of my favorite places to eat back home so I was excited to eat at this location in Vegas.  We found a great deal at those 1/2 price ticket location (they have discounts for shows AND restaurants, I never knew!). We paid $2/each to get $15 off the Meat Rodizio, not bad! Total bill for both of us (including taxes and tips) was $60, which is like 1/2 the bill of the Pampas back home.  Unfortunately, 1/2 the price means 1/2 the quality, I was disappointed in the meat selection.

Service was okay, nothing to complain about but nothing to compliment either.  The salad bar had interesting selections (curry??) Maybe they try to fill you up with the cheap stuff. I did like the bread though, yumm. I wish the sirloin were better cooked, they were a bit dry *sadness* The chicken was tender but needed more flavor. The sausages were a bit salty.  Nothing I tried really hit the spot. It wasn't bad but I guess I had higher expectations :(Fast food restaurant smack dab in the middle of the Fremont Casino.  Inexpensive reliable food ranging from breakfast to Chinese food to hawaiian saimin - often very crowded as patrons are often slow to make decisions on what to eat, so the line backs up.  Hours from 11am to 7am.  They close for a couple hours after the early breakfast crowd.

Highlights:
Chinese plates for $5.99 - great deal, generous portions
Hot dogs - huge dogs!  Suitable for sharing.
Shrimp cocktail - 99cent special with baby shrimp (note, spicy kick to the sauce!)
Saimin - (for Hawaiians - akin to S&S brand saimin), -nice portion.This palace was just too darn big for this girl. We stayed in the palace tower for three nights for a bachelorette party. Let me premise by saying we have a compted room so it was very nice for that reason. 

The best part of the hotel is their pool area and also their Augustus Cafe which had prompt service and great late night eats ( Club Sandwhich and Caeser salad!!!). Housekeeping was friendly and did a good job cleaning. 

CONS:
1) We got a room with two bathrooms thinking that would be helpful for four girls. Nah. The problem is that there is one big connecting shower. Whats the point of that? We cant shower together, ew. So I found that pointless and we should have maybe stayed at the Augustus tower if we had known this. 
2) The pillows are BAD. Probably as old as the hotel. 
3) The room was huge but seriously, the beds look miniature in this room. They were two double beds, and seriously looked like Full size. Not even a queen. 
4) Half the room was empty. It could use some furniture. Also the handles to some of the furniture were broken. 
5) Older crowd, families and lots of weddings. Not really the right kind of scene for a bachelorette party. Venus pool was lame. It is not owned by Club Pure anymore, and its basically a Euro-Topless pool now with bad music playing. Boring. 

The worst part is that every time we called down for anything either A) they enver answered B) transferred to another person who never picked up. So annoying. 

I probably wont stay here again by choice. With the prices they charge for their rooms, Im shocked they are so packed.Love the decor, mostly friendly staff, excellent eateries and shopping.  Always an open seat on the gambling floor and large enough that I never feel boxed in, like at some casinos.  I had a nice 6 night stay when I was here, but I was dissatisfied with my experience for this being a high end casino.  I understand that keeping up with the Jones' has never been more true than for Las Vegas strip casinos, so I understand construction happens.  However, they shut down the pool for 2 days during our visit in the summer because it was a windy day and they feared items would fall from the construction being done in the towers.  Now don't get me wrong, I agree that if there was a chance of that, the pool should be closed, but in the height of summer I felt they should have their construction sites locked down better to prevent this.

Also, I tried the $20 sandwich technique (putting a $20 bill between your license and credit card during check in and asking for an upgrade - works great at most places, even higher end ones), however, I was told that it was not necessary and the receptionist offered me a chance to upgrade for a fee.  I decided, why not and chose to upgrade.  I was pretty upset when I found out that with the cost of the upgrade plus the base rate, I was charged more than if I originally booked the upgraded room.  Nothing makes you more upset than finding out you were duped, even if it is your own fault :)Had the Young Chow Fried Rice which was alright.  The pieces of BBQ Pork could have been larger and tastier.  Service was OK.This is a unique bar in Tempe.  They have old school couches, board games, pool, an odd shot thing at 1am if you take your shirt off, townies, old school bar food, arcade games, and a fake fireplace. 

It's one of my favorite places to take a first date because there is enough around to break the ice and start the conversation.Very simple facility with two grassy acres and a dog watering fountain.Very good food after a long, long wait for a table at 9:00am last Sunday morning.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong items, but as a diabetic I didn't take the chance on a whole stack o'pancakes, which looked great on others' plates. Instead I ordered the "bacon waffle" [yeah, call me a health nut] which was described as having bacon in the batter.  Mine had a strip crumbled on top, but if bacon was also hidden in the waffle I couldn't find it. 
A few last thoughts:  My friend said his cinnamon bread french toast was a-ok. Service was fast, if not cheerful (reminded me of my civil service co-workers); they had a decent sugar-free syrup for me (yay!) and the decor was great.  
Would definately go back and give it another go ... loved the flying pancake mural in the waiting area and the waffle light fixtures ... but I may just stick to JP Pancake instead ...It's May 15, 2009 at about 6:30pm and it's HOT in Vegas.

I was craving some cold noodle soup... and I got some cold soup but got nothing close to what I wanted.

I haven't really had any Korean food, that wasn't Korean BBQ, in Vegas yet so I went to the first place I found.
It wasn't crowded at all so we got good service.
I ordered the Kong Goktsu because it was a cold soup.
It was... interesting.  Noodles in a white bean soup.  There's a first for everything I guess.  It was very bland.  I think that's how it is suppose to be since I got a little container of sea salt to go with it.  The salt definitely helped.  I ate the noodles while enjoying the sides.
Their Bibimbap was decent, though, I'm not big on bibimbap.

If I survive until the winter I'll go back for some Tofu soup.I liked the vibe at the Playboy Club.  It's more chill and classy.  The view is amazing.  The only thing I didn't like is the rabbits wouldn't take a pic with me!?Over rated...way to small of a pool :( one of the few places in the desert that can get pretty humid...get here early...I will say this though-if you have a chance to see the pool at night when going to Tao-do it-it is really pretty...##############56 East Closed####################The first time I tried their Banh mi, it was delicious and the spring rolls are fresh and crispy very satisfying! they took a little long to get our food..the place was empty...but the grilled pork was great, I came back a different night before I left town and was a bit disappointing, granted I ate it all...I WAS HUNGRY, SUE ME!! but the food tasted like it was warmed up in a microwave..it prolly was since we came 30 minutes before they closed. I give it 3 stars for the spring rolls!Pretty good choice.  The salads and the sandwiches are good.  I especially appreciate that they don't soak the salads in dressing.  There are good options for the kids and they always give us an extra cookie even though we spit the kids meals.  The service at the counter isn't very good; if you have questions they aren't very good at answering them.  However the service in the lobby is excellent!We had a great dining experience, however the food was just average. Great cocktail specials from 3-6pm! Wish we would have gone for an earlier dinner.First off, this store has a funky smell when you first walk in that kind of just lingers. Yuck. If Trader Joe's and Pete's Fresh Market got together and had a baby, then Sprouts would be it. Lots of organic products, decent selection of produce. High prices but then again every store I've been to since moving to AZ has much higher prices then what I'm used to in Chicago.....as crazy as that sounds. Haven't found a grocery store that I'm crazy about here yet.Got there late, so the food wasn't the freshest. But the service was very attentive and willing to get us anything we wanted. Mac n Cheese was really good and a variety of dogs and toppings.Good old fashion american diner type restaurant.
the $10.99 small prime rib special is a pretty good place to start
it's not Ruth Chris, but it is a pretty good meal for a reasonable price
salad bar is usually a 2dollar add on. And, worth the 2 bucks.
pasta, various beans and bean salad, cheese, and all of the most common salad fixings. they have a specials menu on their website that shows what to expect for the month. I have never been disappointed with breakfast. All of the normal diner type choices available. Desserts are all house made and good. Pie and coffee.. with a great view of the airports runway. Maybe skip the spaghetti or some of the fried food. Like Fried Chicken, as the cooks could use some training on overcooking and temp control. even the quality of the chicken itself left plenty to be desired.
But, the chicken fried steak and gravy happened to be pretty good.
The service has always been very good..
 
Give the Pepper Steak a try if it's on the specials menu for the day..
Best thing I've had there.  It, was excellent....Man I miss the Korean markets in Chicago!  Asiana is the next best thing if your looking for Korean ingredients.  Surprisingly, Asiana has a huge selection of Indian food, which is fantastic for me (once I learn how to cook Indian dishes).  Good selection and variety, okay prepared ban-chan, prices are higher than what I am used to but this will have to do for now.War alles bestens, hatten dieses Hotel als Zwischenstopp nach Grand Canyon gebucht. Sauber, gratis Parkplatz und gratis Internet. Nicht gerade eine sehr schöne Gegend, nicht sehr viel los. Direkt neben dem berühmten ABC Tv Studios. War zwar direkt neben einem Flughafen, man hörte aber kaum was davon.Convenient location to my hotel.  I like the healthy choices that Subway serves and their frequent deals.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Location clean and well kept.  Good choice for healthy fast food.Monkey.It's good , but I don't think it's the best.  I would go back to eat here.My wife and I have grown tired of grocery meat that just has no flavor, and isn't exciting to eat. I've been looking for a good butcher shop, so when I heard about this from a friend at work I had to go try it out! I went on Friday afternoon 6/6/14 and spent 65$. 2x NewYork Strip (34$ for 2, no bone), 2x Petite Sirloins, 2x Pork Chops, 1lb Hamburger, and 2x Split Chicken Breasts. No coupons... I was expecting to see bright freshly cut meat through through the display case, but it didn't look so fresh. Maybe it was dim lighting or something, but I wasn't too impressed just off looks alone. 

Grilled the NewYorks that night. They were indeed kinda 'grey' when I took them out of the paper. They had a bit of smell to them, but nothing to warrant they were bad. Cooked them up and they tasted fantastic. They grilled up really nice and developed their own crust which was very nice. Wife said it was some of the best steak we have made at home.

Saturday was the pork chops. Nothing special to write about here...

Sunday was the Hamburger. Made patties and grilled it up. Pretty tasty. Wife really loved it, I was kinda on the fence, but it was good.

Monday was the Chicken. Now this is where it gets weird... the chicken had a really strange smell to it, kinda vinegary.... I cleaned it up and then grilled it. No real special seasoning as we were looking to try it straight up. Now I don't know if I am pre-disposed to genetically modified Chicken or what, but this chicken tasted very strange. Almost to the point where my wife and I looked at each other and wondered if this was ok to eat after the first bite. It was thoroughly cooked, so we chowed it down. It had a very odd/strange taste. If someone told me it was chicken, I wouldn't have believed them. Would not get again. 

The petite sirloins went into the freezer, and they have been in there for about a week now. Will probably take them out this weekend to give it ago.

Did not try the sausages. The freezer case had all kinds of interesting stuff in there including bison/buffalo, alligator, shark, and other exotics... Some of it looked a little freezer burned tho with ice crystals forming in the packaging which to me is passed the time they need to be in there, and tossed...

Im not too sure about this place. I really wanted this place to work, because I really want a good butcher shop to visit on a regular basis. Not sure if they age their meat, which is why they don't look so vibrant, or what, but the Steaks is what to get. For now Ill continue to stick with Fresh and Easy with their meat until I find another place. If Im looking for something exotic, their freezer section may be the place to go check out!Good pizza ... they deliver to downtown ... cute restaurant with TVs and the local paper for your enjoyment ... two slices and soda for something like $4.99 ... nice addition to downtown!being honest the review is mainly done based on a take out order that I was able to try at a volunteer event from VPA. They brought the veggie, cheese and salami pizzas. 

Yes you can definitely taste the difference in the cheese, but if only they could improve a bit more the dough....that would make me feel more happy. I'm a bit picky with the dough and love the thin crisp style. Better if you use whole wheat!I really feel like it's my duty to warn others that if you come to this Wendy's to please bring your patience. Please don't stop here for a quick bite or if you're in a rush. The people here work at their own pace. They are all very friendly, but this area is full of retirees and quite a few of them work here. They will chat with you all day about various things, but you have to be willing to give about 10 minutes more of your time whenever you place an order. 

I repeat this specific Wendy's is not a "fast" food joint, but my order here is always right.  :)I occasionally would stop in here when I lived in the area if I needed a book or a cup of diesel when the Starbucks next door had a line out the door.  I like the little outdoor seating area and it's always pretty quiet in the area which was nice.  The customer service was never really excellent on the bookstore side but the Starbucks in there was always friendly.  Not too much else to say.  It's hard to review a bookstore....right?During lunch, be prepared to wait in line for at least 10min. You order your food as they prepare it ....kind of like Subway.  I ordered the "carne asada" taco but I didn't really like the taste of the meat...it tasted really gamey.  I usually get their Friday special for  $4 -  it comes with a cheese enchilada, beans & rice. It's pretty good for the price but again, be prepared to wait in line.Nothing like Zipps! 

Today, I met up with a couple of old co-workers at this location. We had some cocktails and grub. I usually go to the location on Camelback, but this was right around the corner from my friend's house, so it worked out perfectly. 

Day drinking is on-point here, if that's your thing. They have various drink specials on Sat-Sun from 11-4. The food, is consistent as with the other Zipps locations (and Goldie's). 

I had the Philly Steak Eggrolls today, and I was expecting a large serving. It only came with two, so when we left, I ordered a Chopped Salad, which much more generous in size.

Service was the only thing bringing this place down a star from it's usual 4-star self. We waited a good 10-15 minutes to get our check. The server was busy serving other drinks, even though she had our receipts ready to go.

I'd still come back, because I love Zipps. I'm willing to give it another go, and maybe next time, I will bump it up another star.I'm going to echo some of the other reviews on here. 

This restaurant is close by my office so I tried it for lunch, recently. Upon entering, the place looked deserted. The dining room is attractive, but seemed to be set up for a birthday party. It looks like it was remodeled recently. After making a bit of noise for about 3-4 minutes, a lady came out and seated us.

The woman was very friendly and did a good job making recommendations. The food took a while to arrive. The soups we had were great and so was the salad. We had some shish kabbabs (lamb, beef and sea-bass). The beef and sea bass was good, but the lamb had bits of bone and was fairly gristly. The rice was good for the first few bites and then I got a mouthful of slimey wierdness once I got through the top layer. If you ask for water, you get a bottle of Aquafina, which is fine, but unexpected.

While we were eating, another party showed up (that makes 2 groups total). Even though the place was almost empty, it took almost 10 minutes to get our check and another 5 to pay. This wait would have been expected in most parts of Eastern and Western Europe, unfortunately it can be a deal-breaker someone who has a limited time for lunch.

I hate to sound overly negative about Samarkand, because the people working there are actually quite nice and some of the food was good. I will keep it in my lunch rotation and see what happens in future visits.Upside lots of theatres, downside, the staff are as dumb as a box of rocks.  Went to the new Sherlock Holmes film yesterday afternoon.  20 people in line, one staffer, one staffer.  Normally I would use the automated box to buy my ticket, but I had a gold pass.  Don't feel like gold using it though!  This theatre is closest to me, but it drives me nuts when they ask if I want to join their pay for rewards program.  Why would I want to pay for rewards to be your customer-shish.  By the way if you eat at a restaurant and have parked in the garage, validate at the theatre.  They validate longer.  I made the mistake of using validation once from my big Fat Greek and saved a whole dollar.  I repeat one whole dollar.This place is a toss up... Tamales are good the masa is very smooth and moist and different from a lot of places. It's a small place and not super clean but it's  no biggie since we usually get tamales to go. But I am only posting this in hopes that the owner does read their reviews. Their staff is in big need of evaluation. They are far from friendly, slow, unattentive and seriously need to learn to answer the phone.I came in here to order to get takeout it was 19.99 For 2 cheese pizza's ummm not so cheap. They only use 1 type of cheese the pizza was not great I wouldnt go that route again but I am willing to go back and try the Veggie pizza. I surprised my brother with some suicide wing's I dont eat meat but I did try the sauce and ate some w my pizza it was HOT. He loved them all 20 were gone at the end of the night. They said they were SO HOT but the boys just couldnt stop eating them. They said they were very good meaty and not too vinegary. An extra star for making the boys happy with the hella hot wings that night. FYI they probably use hydrogenated oils here by the way but I didnt ask!The only reason we ended up here was because Sonic wasn't open on Christmas Day.  We spotted a bunch of African cabbies in a parking lot so we parked and explored our options.  Most went into Juba so we did too.

The place was a big dingy so we opted for takeout.  Greek salad, falafels, king fish, Lamb shank, Mediterranean appetizers. But the owner came to the market to find us and tell us they didn't have any more falafels. We changed to Lamb kabob and chicken kabobs.

Everything came with fresh lettuce and tomatoes. The best was the rice which was seasoned with cardamom and raisins and other spices.  The worst was the hummus and falafel in the appetizer plate.  I ate a chicken kabob in pita which was quite good.  The meat was still juicy and the dressing was just right.

I would order everything except the appetizer plate.So, a few friends and myself have been staying at the Siena Suites for the past 3-4 days.  Last night around 3:30 an employee came knocking on our windows for 10-20 minutes..  Called up to the front desk this morning and explained what had happend and they said that it's impossible that employee's wouldn't do that.  3 people seen it happen and can confirm it was an Employee.  But whom ever I talked to didn't want to discuss it.  

I don't think I'll be staying here again when employee knock on peoples windows, and then argue it wasn't them.I used to like this place a lot more than I do now. It's right by my house, but lately it really has gone down in the dumps. The positive things they do have going for them 
1) they typically have $5 BJ & $5 craps 
2) on Friday nights from 6 to 10 pm they have $2 you call it drinks 
3) have a lot of parking 
4) they have a Steak 'n Shake 
5) they have a movie theater 
6) they have a bowling alley

Things that are not going well for them
1) it's like pulling teeth to get comps there. They want you to play $25 a hand when the table min is $5 AND by the way this is not a high end Casino.  I highly doubt 95% of the people here are playing $25/hands. This isn't the Bellagio people
2) you can't win, so why play $25 hands. Last couple of times I've been here I've been massacred at the tables
3)  Dealers have gotten very strange & talk about the weirdest subjects. Like why you should invest all your money in Silver for the doomsday and fallout of the American Dollar. I don't want to talk about this, it's just weird PLUS I came here to relax and have a good time not solve the world's problems
4) No sound during football games at the Sports Book, you can look/watch but you can't listen
5)  No good breakfast place, there's only 1 place here besides the buffet that has breakfast and it's not very good at all
6) Oyster bar used to be really good, but now it's not
7) steakhouse is slightly below average in my opinion {every big casino needs an awesome steakhouse]Buffalo Wild Wings is perhaps my favorite cookie cutter type restaurants The wings are always cooked perfectly and I have no complaints about the food here.
 
I do have to comment on poor service as the daughter and I who both ordered spicy food had empty drinks for at least five minutes. (Twice) I finally just waved down another server and begged for some liquid relief. 
 
Oh and cant forget the gang tags found in the bathroom. Just be careful not to wear the wrong color or sport team jersey as you may get shanked.

I won't be back as there are numerous places to get wings with great customer service that doesn't disappear when your drink gets low.Service was great!!! 

Food was good.  Now I understand the difference between normal mackarel and japanese mackarel.  Japanese one is better.

Portion sizes were very very very small.  We ordered the Omakase, and left hungry.  Had to stop at I *Heart* Burgers at the Palazzo shops to fill up.  So, go for a snack, not a meal.My first date with my husband was at a Ricardo's location that no longer exists so I have a certain fondness for this restaurant.  A good feature is they are open late so swing shift employees can get a bite to eat after work.  However, I find the food to be middle of the road Mexican.  Not disgusting but certainly not great.If you notice in previous reviews, most of the negatives are from people who aren't trying this place for what it is : a PIZZA joint. Sure the wings are a soggy mess (how can you butcher frank's hot sauce like that, lino?!) and the pasta can often times taste like sweat (probably due to the big guy who's cookin it or the metal container. ugh). But the pizza itself is nice, thick, and could quite possibly double for a pizza pie made from the hands of Jesus (If you believe in that kind of thing).

Before you visit Lino's, MAKE SURE THEY ARE OPEN. the first few times I went to Lino's before 4 pm on a weekday I was turned around pizza-less. Luckily for them the prices were good enough for me to try back (although they recently raised their prices around 10 percent on most items). What is the world coming to? Gas prices now LINO??!!

If you want good pizza, go to Lino's. If you want good pasta, go to Italy (or Olive Garden, you little tough guy you). Enough said.Balboa definitely fills my late night need for pizza.  Their pizza is good, but not great.  Sometimes the crust is overly soggy, making the toppings slide right off.  Some of the specialty pizzas are kind of icky.  However, I get their supreme pizza (or whatever they call it there) and sub jalapenos for the ham... and I'm pretty fond of it.  It's an ok place, but a bit overpriced for what you get.They have made great efforts to really clean this area up over the past few years.  They are now starting to install old Vegas Neon signs for display.  This is very cool! I can't say I would want to spend tons of time down here, but we always make a day for Fremont Street when we visit Vegas.  They now have zip lines, so every few minutes someone goes flying overhead screaming....I thought this was cool until my husband pointed out that airborne drunk people overhead might not end well...Ha, and I was worried about the pigeons...Anyway, i love a little old vegas!Always CLEAN and PLENTY of room to EAT-IN. PLUS they always remember your face even though they may not speak english they KNOW what you want. The murals all over are very soothing TOO
Consistent. Always the same thing. Burgers & Fries are REALLY good. Tacos are good, NOT very spicy though, red & green sauce are a little mild. They do not grill the tortillas. Which is good if you don't like the mess BUT if you like them flavorful you WANT grilled tortillas
A MEDIOCRE MEXICAN TACO STAND A real nice lunch spot. If you only have 30 minutes and you just wanna get full this is good for you. YOU need to special order here and tell them to add chileS to everything to spice it up but the MEATS are very tender & good NOT that OTHER stuff. If you want a GOOD fast food burger try one and the fries are ALWAYS fresh. EVERY thing is MADE TO ORDERThis place is pretty cool and all...$450 for an unfurnished studio,and $500 for a furnished utilities included..plus they have rent a cops..yaaaaa to the rescue right?...right?.....This place USED to be my go to for beef kabobs.  I didn't mind the wait since I know I'd be getting fresh and quality food. But not anymore. During our last two visits, their beef kabobs is not as fresh as it used to. Meat has a distinct off taste to it, texture wasn't right. Their rice is not the same either. Chicken is decent.Planned my sons 5th birthday party here. My fault for doing it on a Saturday. The place is packed. Total insanity. Very, very loud. Don't expect to be carrying on any conversations with the other parents. Kids running everywhere. Kids had fun. I mean it's Chuck E Cheese so I wasn't expecting perfection. My beef is with the pricing. Kids cost $12.99 each for the party package which is no biggie and you can order extra pizzas for parents at $16 a pop. BUT you also have to buy individual drinks for the adults too. I don't know about you but I had about 4 times the amount of adults to kids and at $2 a drink that was almost $100 more. They leave that part out until you get there. And no you can't bring in bottled water or anything. This place is expensive for a kids party but everyone has to do it at least once so save up!
Did like that they "number" you and your child with a stamp at the door so when you leave they make sure you have the right child. 
Selma, our party hostess, was great. Very helpful and one of the few teenagers working there that wasn't totally hating life.It reminds me of any mall. Nothing special. I guess the locals have to shop somewhere?The Fashion Show Mall is a place to see and be seen. The high class department stores and shops draws in a certain crowd and it feels like very little shopping gets done. 

I am a big fan of walking the malls. I love the outdoor ones, but when summer is in full effect, I engage in some A/C perusing. While I love some window shopping, sometimes you want to walk out with something to show for it and I consistently leave empty handed. There are rarely any deals worth taking advantage of. Although the Fashion Show is home of my favorite stores, I would rather go to Town Square or the outlets to get Banana Republic, GAP, or Express.

The plus side is that this mall often holds fashion shows or cool events on the rise up stage near the Apple Store.No different than a normal CPK.  Grabbed a later night pie and ate it in the room.  Went BBQ Chicken, their specialty.  Good as always.

Good service and food came out fast.  Another bonus for the Mirage.I am a Mediterranean food junkie!! Khoury's is really authentic Lebanese food which always satisfies my cravings. It is extremely delicious and addicting! I recommend the chicken kabob plate with hummus. The fatosh salad is amazing too! I've had problems in the past with slow service but they are very friendly which, for me, makes up for it. :)I ordered the Big Turkey and the boyfriend ordered the Meaty as these were recommended by the cashier. The Meaty was flavorful, but the bread was a bit hard to bite through. The Big Turkey lived up to its name as it had LOTS of turkey. We decided on the potato salad for the side. It was good, but would have been better if it was less salty. We also ordered a Rice Aracini ball and french fries. The french fries were crispy and not too greasy; however the Aracini Ball was a bit of a disappointment not enough cheese and  very bland. The biggest let down of all were the desserts, especially since they looked so tempting in the display case. We ordered a cannoli and the chocolate mousse creme brulee. The cannoli shell was not crispy and flaky and the marscapone was dry. The creme brulee was ok, nothing special about it at all. Overall, the sandwiches were decent and I would go back to get more sammwiches.The only reason I gave them 3 stars is because my 16 oz. lobster was more like 8 oz. Otherwise I have to say they are pretty damn good. I had a bowl of the crab bisque that was an utter amazement! It came with chunks of crab and tons of deliciousness! My husband had seared ahi that was great. 

Also, the stone crab is super buttery, no need for the mustard they give you or any other condiment. It's perfect just the way they serve it.

It's somewhat pricey but worth the experience.I love Joe's the food is amazing!!!! Lunch or dinner you can't go wrong. 
       That being said the valet out front is horrendous. I know its run by the forum shops and not Joe's;  but perception is everything.
         Went to Joe's back in September.  The gentleman that came to get our keys was so rude that my friend wouldn't let him park the car. She brought it further away to a different valet and had to walk back to Joe's. 
           Friday evening I went back to Joe's and went to valet. Well my sunglasses were stolen. This was there second strike. I know you might think of she probably lost them, but I assure you they were in the car.
            I am very well aware of the fact Joe's does not run valet but it is the only convenient way to together.  One shot in the door. No hassles of crowds.Hit or miss on the friendliness of staff. I've had really awesome people there, And I've had people who didnt look or speak to me the whole time they were taking my drink order. Otherwise, this location really needs a drive through. Not much parking for location being in busy area.Great view, awesome actually. After that it is a club/bar/joint. Drinks are stronger than average for FLV. On different nights a different vibe. You can certainly have some INTERESTING things happen there since THE Hotel is just below, get it?
Certainly worth the trip up stairs, get there earlier so at least you can meander outside.Food = mediocre
View = amazingIt has been a few years since I've been to a Mimi's, so when one of the other two couples we were going out with suggested it, we agreed.

I ordered the chicken breast from the 3-course seasonal menu.  It came with soup or salad, the main course, and a mini-dessert.  I decided that for once I'd say no to dessert, and the waitress let me have the soup and salad instead of dessert.  I had the French onion soup, which was very good.  Though I love it, I usually never order it anywhere because it's always way too salty.  Happy to say that it was much less salty here, and after that and the salad, I was finished.  

Knowing that I'd be eating at home solo the next night, I took the main course home.  It's a good thing I fill up easily; otherwise there would have been no leftovers.  The chicken breast was really, really small.  It was the smaller half of a chicken breast, covered with bacon and cheese.  It came with a creamy tomato sauce with diced artichoke hearts.  If it had been swimming in the sauce, I may not have noticed the size, but I asked for the sauce on the side.  It was dwarfed by a big mound of mashed potatoes, and a very tiny bit of fresh vegetables - two broccoli florets, and two slices each of green and yellow zucchini.  When I had the main course tonight, it was good, but nothing to rave about.

Service was efficient, but not overly friendly.

With so many great restaurants to choose from in Vegas, Mimi's will never be my first choice, but it's definitely an okay occasional alternative.TLDR: no car wash, general service, mostly prepackaged foods, connected to a McDonalds

This Terrible's reflects the par-standard experience you will receive at many Chevron locations. While the standard clerk attempts to provide expedient service, the lines for check-out May reflect the need for additional staffing. At this location, you can select your own fountain drink with their updated Coca-Cola Freestyle Drink Machine. But even with 100+ drink combinations to choose from, how can you compete with the $1 drink for any size at the adjoining McDonald's? Is the $0.49 worth your time? Only time will tell. I foresee all Terrible's locations to be updating to this dispenser-type system. 

Restrooms aren't that bad. For the afternoon, it looked pretty maintained. Needless to say, it's right near the freeway and connected a McDonald's; I wouldn't be dissuaded in stopping by soon.Not so great today. Do not go here early. I sat there for 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged me. I didn't think they were open yet. So, I sat there like an idiot. The waitress charged extra for things that we never were charged for before. Like cucumbers on my salad????? Normally we love it here. 

Usually love this place. They should make Sue work 24/7. The current waitstaff stinksEveryone needs a sandwich.

Infused into the gas station this business has a nice little thing going. I've had quite a few sandwich from here after filling up on gas. Each time the staff have been pleasant and respectful.

I will say that few times I've called ahead for sandwiches they have been dry or cold. But on the whole the Philly steak sandwiches are great. I'll always be repeat hereI hope this review makes sense. Sushi-Ko was good by American standards. It is the best Japanese food we've come across in the states. But if the place was actually in Japan it would be the worst Japanese food we've tried. Does that make any sense at all? 
We moved to Vegas last year after nine incredible years in Japan. We've had a heck of a time finding good, authentic Japanese food. We really want some good yakisoba. I was sure this was going to be the place because, as I understand it, it is owned by a Japanese man. I was wrong--this was not the place for good yakisoba.
The yakisoba was not good. The noodles were wrong. The dish was FULL of vegetables. In Japan they use mostly noodes, then some meat and then a bit of veggies. This dish from Sushi-Ko was more veggies than anything else. And the flavor was not there at all. Street vendors in Japan sell better yakisoba. Sadly, this was actually the best attempt we've seen in the states.
We also orderd the beef dunburi. The beef was actually very good. The terkiyaki was just right and the meat was tender. However, it was served on FLUFFY rice!! I was very disappointed in the rice and it ruined the entire dish for me. For some reason Americans like fluffly rice. I don't get it and I don't get what fluffly rice was doing in a place that supposedly serves Japanese cuisine. 
The gyoza were good but not at all like what you'd get in Japan. Sushi-Ko's gyoza was made in a like a crispy fried shell. In Japan they are served in what is more like a noodle. Think of it kind of like a ravioli. It wasn't what we were used to. I prefer the noodle version but the gyoza was still good. 
I ordered the smoked salmon sushi and was very disappointed. It was not like any smoked salmon I ever got in Japan. Not even close. Plus, it had a funny chemical taste to it. It did not taste fresh at all.
The California rolls with  crab were actually very good and worth the extra money for the real crab rather than immitation. But finding good California rolls in the states is not an oddity. 
Overall I was very disappointd with the place. If you've never tried authentic Japanese food then this place will probably be a treat.  However, if you've been exisiting on authentic Japanese food for the past nine years then you'll notice that this place is like all the Chinese places in the states--totally Americanized.This was the first time I've eaten pupusas.  And they were delicious!
     The dishes were great tasting and well portioned.  The prices are affordable and the service was prompt.
     What was the downer?  The bathroom wasn't clean...  :(
     I was planning to give this place solid four stars, but the trip to the bathroom made me reconsider.  
     Hopefully, the owner will read this entry and clean that restroom so the customer's last impression won't decrease.Eaten here twice, both times consistent and fresh. Good flavors and the vegetables are quality - no babycorn or water chestnut fillers in the noodle dishes. Very clean, spotless dishes. (sounds weird but it is notable)

Food: The Singapore Mei Fun was great, as were the Chicken w/Garlic Sauce and the wildcard: a 1/2 order Orange Chicken Combo Special (6.95 and the size of a full order at any other Chinese restaurant) which comes with broccoli, a spring roll and your choice of rice. Brown rice is available for an extra $1. 

Service: Absolutely everyone I've interacted with at this restaurant is really cheerful and helpful, the waitstaff filled our water glasses at least 5 times over the course of our last lunch there - not so much because we were parched, but because our glasses were 2/3rds full of ice. They could make their job easier by putting less ice in their water glasses but they choose not to cut that corner and for that reason I think service at Baidu China Bistro is exceptional. 5 stars for service. You can tell there is good management here - the morale seems to be very high. No grumpy chefs slamming their woks down on the burner here!

Nice to find another good Asian eatery in the SW corridor when we need to run to Party City or Best Buy down on Rainbow/215.Good food at a good price should work on customer service though.Friendly staff and easy to get in and out in a hurry.I stumbled upon this place one day when I was craving for real Chinese food, and because it was the only place close to my house. I am giving them three stars to start because I wasnt that impressed with their food, they were a little too salty for my taste buds and a bit greasy too. The staff were pretty nice and polite though, the service was fast too it was just the food can be improved more.I was walking by after leaving anoher bar and saw that this place had appetizers for half price.  We decided to check it out.  We sat upstairs and the place was empty with only two tables with a couple people.  It took a long time for our server to come around and take our order for it being not busy.

I ordered the margarita and hubby ordered the blue moon.  For food we got the hummus and chicken tenders with buffalo sauce and ranch.  The drinks came back pretty quick along with the food.  My margarita was good, but why not in a margarita glass?  It was in a regular glass, which I thought was wierd.

We then ordered the crab cake sliders, which were not good at all.  My hubby is not a picky eater and he didn't even like them...way too salty!  Don't order these! 

The decor is nice and the music was good.  I liked the live guitar player/singer.  He had a great voice and provided good entertainment for the night.

Oh yea, the server did come over to chat with us and was really nice.  It just took a while to come around when we first arrived, but the rest of the night service was good.Still a High rating because I will continue to stay here...!

PROS:
-Slightly off the strip (which means less chaos)
-Directly across the street from the mall :)
-Great customer service
-Valet is quick
-Nice pool (mellow and relaxing. Not ratchet and gross like rehab)
-Kitchens :D so if you're a health nut like me, you can make your oatmeal in the morning
-No loud casino to walk through when you just want to get to your room
-4pm check outs :)

CONS:
-train is loud 
-housekeeping never cleans your room (even if you leave the light on)
-only some rooms have dishes..etc
(So you must request)


Besides that... Really great place to stay.
Cosmo is my next favorite if I'm in the mood to be a Vegas vampire...but Trump takes the lead for a quiet, friendly stay without the craziness.

UPDATE:
Time to check out and guess what?? We all know there is no service in here right So I had no choice but to use the room phone!! and my phone bill was over $1000! I told my friends to call my room cause I couldn't get service and FML FML $9 a minute! Wow. Shouldn't incoming calls be free?This was my first visit for dinner with a $60 comp.  The restaurant was located in the Suncoast Casino in Las Vegas.  There was mainly a large bar seating area where you can watch your meal/sushi being prepared. 

The Roasted Corn Chowder with Crab ($5.50) was thick and creamy.  It was a rather small portion with about a tablespoon of crab on top.

My friend ordered the Fried Tilapia entree ($15.50).  It came with a salad, mixed vegetables, and a scoop of mashed potatoes all on the same plate.

My Rainbow Sashimi ($20) was fresh and melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  There were 9 thick slices of Salmon,Tuna, and Hamachi served on a bed of shredded cucumber.

We both ordered Tiramisu ($6.50) for dessert.  It came in a small parfait glass with just the right proportions of ladyfingers and marscapone cream.

Service was friendly and efficient.  We got refills of our beverages without having to ask.

I would come back just for the Roasted Corn Chowder with Crab.I had reserved a room at Planet Hollywood for my birthday and I was excited for the stay based on the pictures on Yelp.

But that wasn't what I got.

I walked into the room (which was the lowest price range) and was incredibly unhappy. The room was SMALL. The bathroom looked like a wreck and it just felt icky in there. So I called the front desk asking if I could upgrade to the next price range up (which was an extra $20/night, that sounded pretty reasonable).

Extra star for letting us check in 3 hours early and for being super super accommodating with letting us switch rooms.

I don't remember what the second one up is, I wish I did so it could probably help those of you looking at this review but the room was significantly bigger and the bathroom arrangement was MUCH better. It had the tub in the middle, the shower on the right and the toilet on the left as well as two bathroom sinks.

The second night in, I called housekeeping for more towels. After waiting about 45 minutes with nothing, my husband called again and someone was promptly at our door within 10 minutes with not only new towels, but WARM new towels! Not really sure what happened that first time around. 

The Mile Shops are okay. The fact that Earl of Sandwich is open 24 hours is a nice plus. My only other complaint is that it was hard to find the room elevators in the casino.

Judging by other reviews on here, it seems like your stay will be fantastic if you pick the right room price level. I'd probably give this resort another go. The stay wasn't awful and the beds were nice to sink into after a long day of walking.This is the old Alladin hotel. They've done some updating, but it could use more. I've given three stars primarily because our experience with the staff was subpar, but also the décor is so dated. We were treated rudely by bar staff, indifferently by staff at the spa, and ignored by the maid staff. 

We ordered two waters at the bar and the waitress barked back that we had to order drinks in order to sit down. Of course we were going to get drinks, we were just parched and wanted water first. 

The spa staff was not friendly, like we are used to at other resorts. I think it's because a 20% gratuity is already included. They took it for granted. 

On two occasions the maids promised to come clean our room, once at noon, and then at 5pm. They showed up at 11:30pm, and woke us up. Lame.

On the brighter side, the Diamond check in was great, the taxi lines in and out were short, the on-sight PF Changs was great fantastic, the dancing models in the casino were a big plus, the cabanas, pool scene, pool service were great.I gave this restaurant an extra star for the view of the canal. You do the math. I just find it overpriced. The ingredients were fresh and the food was good but even in Vegas I think this restaurant was too full of themselves. When the waiter talks about the restaurant's history more than the food you know you are in trouble.

I had a seafood pasta that was traditional and cooked perfectly, but I could've cooked it perfectly. There was nothing unique about it. The sauce could've been out of a can for all I know. Just didn't stand out. The Chicken parm was good but someone's arm hurts in the kitchen because the chicken was so flat that you almost couldn't tell if it was veal or chicken, I guess this isn't a terrible thing. Just not traditional in my opinion (I also think I make the best chicken parm in the world). Anyways, i give the desserts 5 stars. Their pastry chef is working hard back there and the chocolate and little fancy truffles and whatevers were melt in your mouth delicious. The desserts made the meal enjoyable.

What was not enjoyable, however, was the bill. Way over priced for regular old Italian food! Even for Vegas. The staff was great and they worked there ass off trying to make up for the high price tag.Mixed review: we came here for late night happy hour and the drinks were great for half price. Waitress was friendly.  Ordered a mini pizza from the happy hour appetizers and it was awful! Then the waiter said the crust was supposed to be soft (under cooked). Oh. Right. Yeah. I have eaten pizza in New York and New Haven and Paris. This was my first crust like that. I think I know raw dough when I see it.  He brought us slices instead, which was very nice.Stopped in for dinner before Love.

First off, the prices are pretty high. But it's in a row of "high class" dining (Samba, Stack, Japonais, etc.) so I can't really expect them not to keep in line with the local pricing.

The staff can be quite "hovery" one moment, and then "disappeary"

I ordered the "Dinner and a Show" package which is $49 dollars and you can pick from a soup (well your pick is always Egg Drop because that's the only soup), appetizer, entree, and dessert.  I had the Pot Stickers, which were really good (and probably the highlight of the meal).  The Sweet and Sour Pork was good, but nothing exceptional.  The Dessert was Vanilla Brulee which was quite good with the added fruit.

The Ambiance is nice, but a bit dark, and it IS hard to forget that there is a casino right outside.

Overall I would say the price really is the biggest drawback. Between myself and my wife I spent more than I would for a dinner at The Melting Pot (Granted, this is more food for sure).  Since it was planned as our "Expensive Dinner" before the show I knew what I was getting into, but I would never just "Stop in" here for a meal.The food was good, don't get me wrong. But the after affect is what turn me down. Tandoori Times 2 used oils with trans-fat to cook their foods. I would like to support the local business, but trans-fat should be banned in Arizona.Ming's Table isn't as bad as most people make it out to be.  But it isn't exactly a place you'd should have dinner at.  For lunch it's not too bad of a deal with their midweek special.  I only came here for the $19.99 all you can eat sushi and minced beef soup deal (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NFOj3uboFzeNF5X-dWUd_w?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw).  The sushi was pretty bland but I didn't care, I was hungry and wanted a quick lunch and that's exactly what I got, plain and simple.  Might come here for lunch again if I'm staying at Harrah's like last time.  It was a nice convenience.Love this place when I'm in the mood for some donuts. I'll be honest here, I'm not a big fan of sweets, but boy do I like me some fresh warm cooked donuts when I have a sweet tooth. I like the idea how they have a little observation area where you can watch the employees (or should I say machine) make the donuts and watch the employees pick out the fresh donuts.

I will never buy donuts anywhere else besides this place. Gotta have the known glaze donuts every time I come here. Not much of a chocolate or sprinkles fan, but my son sure loves all those different toppings on e'm.

NOTE: Don't for get the milk!The only thing that avoids the 4th star is the lack of veggies in their menu (aside from "just salads"). But if you are in the mood of a burger or ribs, and also a nice place outdoors this is the place. The taste of their products is fresh and they do feel recently harvested.

If you are not US born (like me) and used to have always veggies with your meet...you'll miss somehow here. Good for a meat craving day.Bertha's is yummy but is the slowest place I have ever been for lunch.  Even if you beat the crowd....and there is a huge crowd...you still seem to wait 30 minutes for your food.  The food is incredible.  Love the sandwiches and salads and love the place but I have decided only to go on off times.  Everyone I have taken there gripes about the wait but raves about the food.  C'mon Bertha...you're slammed at lunch b/c people love you, let's get some efficiency going in the kitchen.Three years ago, I would have given this place 5 stars. Today, three stars is a bit of stretch. In short.. great concept, poor execution.

Create your own cupcakes? Sounds great! Kids adore this place. They have several different flavors, toppings, fillings, and they can even sculpt Elmo. 

The issue with the cupcakes is the texture. It's hard to eat them without a utensil. They crumble when you bite into them. The cupcakes have great flavor. They just happen to be too moist.

If you have a kiddo with you, stop by. If not, head to Gigi's,  the Cupcakery or even Smith's.Just wanted something quick and gave this place a try.
It was ok because I was hungry and service was good.
Still cant beat the sushi at takamatsu which is only yards away down the street.04/06/10

Love the cupcakes!  I don't love the price :(  Of the dozen I chose, my faves were the Strawberry Creme, Coconut, Red Velvet, Dark Dark Chocolate (w/ and w/out sprinkles!), and the ultimate, Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chip!

The strawberry tasted like real strawberries!  Not just strawberry flavor.  I could taste strawberries in the icing AND the cake.  Amazing!  The Red Velvet was just the best version of this variety I've ever tried... So moist...  Same goes w/ the Dark Dark Chocolate... the ultimate devil's food cupcake!  Wish I could have a spoonful of that dark chocolate ganache frosting right now!  As for the Coconut and the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, I'd cry if I had to choose only one...  The Coconut had such rich flavor of coconut in the frosting, and I really enjoyed the fresh-tasting and non-greasy feel of the coconut flakes that topped the lemon-scented vanilla cake below.  Mmm!!  The best, for me, though were the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip cupcakes!  The bakers at Sprinkles got the essence of peanut butter here exquisitely.  Combined w/ high-quality chocolate chips, I could not NOT eat just half of a cupcake, or even just ONE cupcake!  I don't know where I found the restraint to do so, but I was able to save the second piece for a rehash of all that peanutty-chocolate greatness fifteen minutes later :)  [Fifteen minutes, fifteen seconds; half of one, two quarters of another... LOL]

Two stars docked for the high cost of each cupcake; how I was rushed to make my selections; and even with the specialized box packaging, some of the cakes jumbled around and their frostings' muddled and not picture-perfect.  A coworker had brought to work the day before what she claimed were homemade extra-large cupcakes in a box that was large and deep enough to securely house and present the cupcakes beautifully.  (I say "claimed" bec. I recognized the sugar dot candies that topped her XL cupcakes to be Sprinkles' logo. Now I know where she got them... they're leftovers from Sprinkles' cupcake mixes!  Now, I wonder where she procured that specially-designed box?  Maybe I should get her people and Sprinkles' to talk to each other...)  She even had silver and gold dusting on the frosting; None of the Sprinkles' selections I bought had glitter.  I feel that safe transport and great presentation from bakery to table should also be taken in account for what Sprinkles (and other gourmet bakeries) charge their customers to pay for their products.  Don't you?

Loved the sweets, but I won't be paying for any of them again :(2.5 stars for this diner? Lol. Awe you guys, be nice! At least make it a solid 3. 

It was late at night and my 15 year old little sister and I didn't want to wait 2 hours for Serendipity across the street. We didn't know where to go, and all the buffets were closed :( This was, sad to say, our last resort. 

Everyone who was was eating here was...old. Lol. Certainly no eye candy. Unless of course, that is your thing. It's not mine, so this was like a visit to the nursing home to me. 

The workers were unbelivably and undeniably sweet. Though they were of much help in the front, it lacked a bit of work back in the kitchen. Either they were just really slow already because they've been working all day or there are more senior citizens back there, working. I mean, I was SOO HUNGRY, and really wanted my (imitation) loco moco. 

In due time our food came. It was not bad. (Again, I was hungry.. and we all know what happens to food when consumed in a stomach of a famished monster..it becomes 10x better than it really is.)

I would probably not be back here. Not because it was horrible, which it wasn't.. But just because I'd rather pay double of what I did and get fat in one of the 69 buffets in Vegas.Be ready to eat! Huge portions on most plates.  Try the strawberry lemonade for sure! Service tends to be alright ..nothing to brag about. Its a place to feel comfortable at with a nice quiet atmosphere for being a big place.Went here with the family and really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food.  A few things were a bit off kilter, like the bus boy saying they don't accept credit cards when they do, and our waiter being a bit slow on water, but overall a good dining experience.  The food is what sold me.  Flavorful and delightful.  Interesting options given that its a cross between Italian and Mediterranean.  Also, the current owner's great grandfather first opened the restaurant so its been around while; kinda cool for those who care.We hiked Camelback in the morning, returned to our hotel to clean up, and headed back to check out Elements. Unfortunately we arrived as they were between lunch and dinner, so we had to settle for Jade Bar.  

The views from the restaurant were amazing, and the cozy fireplace was nice on the unusually chilly day. In the bar, the views are not as open, but you can still appreciate the beauty. We ordered a couple of non-alcoholic drinks, as we hadn't eaten much yet. They were refreshing and simple, nothing too exciting. I was starving so I ordered the Caesar salad. It came relatively quickly, and was a decent size, but didn't look like anything special, until I started digging in. That's where I found a "bonus" penne pasta at the bottom of the bowl, and later, the core of the romaine lettuce, and a stray little piece of tomato. You'd think that a place that is known for serving celebs and which has received such a high ratings from everyone would really have the details down, but I have to admit, we were disappointed. We peeked at Elements' menu on our way out, and nothing on there stood out as impressive or inventive, so we opted not to come back for dinner.

On a separate note, I realize this is a luxury spa/resort, but is valet parking really necessary when there are less than 5 cars in the lot, and the valet had to merely run less than 50 yards to retrieve my car? I felt obligated to tip him, but I was perfectly capable of walking to my car from there.  The overall experience here was an extravagance we didn't need to indulge in.So I might be a spoiled American but I have to say I was definitely disappointed at the portion size I recieved when I ordered my BBQ Pork appetizer. While the strips did taste good they were gone just a little to fast. The eggrolls are decent, not the best ive ever had but definitely edible. 

My entree was delicious. I ordered the braised bean curd (tofu), which came with some steamed rice and it was very good. The pork fried rice was pretty good too along with the chicken chow mein. Overall I think this place was definitely worth visiting and I'll probably be coming back but its not the kind of place you rave about to all your friends. If your looking for good food and a small businesses family atmosphere this place is for you. If you are looking for somewhere to impress a date with your excellent taste maybe think about going somewhere else.We were staying at Red Rock while visiting family in the western Vegas area. We went into Hachi for dinner on a Thursday night. The place looked great- I loved the dark ambiance and decor. We were seated right away, but then again, there were only about 5 other parties in the restaurant. 

We were served a soup, compliments of the chef (although, the server slipped them onto the table and I did not hear what he said it was). It was good in taste... but a cold soup, which I'm not a huge fan of. We then ordered Edamame, which was good... although I have yet to see a restaurant screw up Edamame. I mean, they're steamed and salted and then placed on the table. My boyfriend ordered a sampler plate of sushi and he seemed to really enjoy it. Since I'm not big on sushi, I ordered california rolls and chicken fried rice. They were both good, but I'd put them on the same level as eating at Ra... except double the price.I've only been here once however the time was enjoyable. The staff greeted my mom and I right away, asked if we had worked with someone prior which my mom had however the sales man was not in therefore, the door guy stuck with us. The guy was friendly and helpful, i mean he's a salesman right.. so really he should be. The only thing that was not great was the sales guy hitting on my moms "little cute butt". After that my mom became uncomfortable but because she had liked the couch I told her to just brush it off and avoid making the situation awkward.Sushi Brokers and I go a ways back.  Used to come here for reverse happy hour back in high school because it was the only "cool" bar we could go to after 10 on a weekend lol.  I have generally always gone for reverse happy hour, which in my opinion is the only thing Sushi Brokers has going for it.  Happy Hr prices are very reasonable, and they have all the standard types of sushi on the happy hour menu, as well as some creative rolls.  Happy hour aside though....it absolutely blows my mind how expensive their sushi is during normal pricing.  While the fish isn't bad per say....it is not high quality stuff.  It's edible, but nothing special to warranty the prices they charge.  Stick to the rolls here...most of them are covered in yummy sauces which help mask the lackluster fish.  Lots of their appetizers on the happy hr menu are pretty decent too...crab rangoons, calamari, and spring rolls are all regular items on my bill.

The service here can be hit or miss depending on whos working.  I know its really just a bar, so I feel bad complaining about service, but sometimes it really flat out sucks.  Pretty extensive bar selection, lots of good drinks, but I mainly just do beer/sake here.  Back in the day they used to have one of the largest selections of vodka's in the city....not sure if that still holds true.

I really want to give them 2 stars, but I can't.  The reverse happy hour really is a good deal, especially when I just want to go out and grab a few drinks and some food with friends and not deal with any Scottsdale BS like you would encounter at a place like Sapporo.

Take my advice folks ONLY come here during happy hour or reverse happy hour, its not worth it any other time.Bacon wrapped hot dog. Yup. Why you so expensive though? $4 for a drink? I'd rather compile, collect, and store my saliva in my left cheek and swallow every 10 minutes.OK place to go.  Good range of music.  Nice outdoor area where you can still feel the AC.  Prices really suck.Most of the food consumed at a 'bertos is like bad sex.  It's cheap, dirty, and leaves you with a burning sensation the next day.

But fear not, gentle readers, I come bearing a message of hope. Not all 'bertos are created equal.

I used to live down the street from Poliberto's when it was Happy China Buffet, but never ventured into the dingy beige joint.  Then they went and added some electric yellow paint and garish red trim and for some reason it drew me in like a skeeter to a bug zapper.

There wasn't a drive-up here, only take out or dine-in, and the place was packed with my people.  Us poor unfortunates that work outside all day, covered in sweat, dirt, and godknowswhat.  So I figured it was a sign of some sort.  And I was right.  The carnitas were tender and crispy, the guacamole was flavorful and chunky and there were about five different types of salsa for me to measure the mettle of my taste buds against.

It's cheap as sin but doesn't leave me with that seedy, slightly used feeling the next morning.  Give it a whirl if you feel like your lard quotient for the week needs to be met.  It's a step up from Fili-B's fare.(3 1/2 stars.) 

As previous posters have stated, Kobalt smells like a movie theater. The smell of popcorn is the first thing I noticed when I walked in the door. There are cute little bowls every few feet on the bar as well. You REALLY want me to have some popcorn with my gin and tonic, don't you, Kobalt? Well, alright. Don't mind if I do.

This place is alright. It's near the light rail, although it's still really hard to find if you're not sure where you're going. You'll have to walk across a parking lot and into a office (I think?) plaza to get to the bar. But hey, think of it as an adventure. 

The ambiance of the place is kind of goofy, in my opinion. Lots of neon blue lighting against steel surfacing. This mixed with the delectable aroma of Orville Redenbacher's Butter Lovers was sort of an odd overall vibe. But hey, I'm not complaining. The drinks were good, service was good, and the crowd was good. I may not go out of my way to hang out at Kobalt but I'd certainly go back if presented the opportunity.This place is so cool! The menus are on the walls in sharpie along with signatures from a lot of local athletes. They will not present a bill to you, but rather trust you to tell them what you ordered and pay the correct amount. The food is great, artery clogging, and comes in huge portions. I like the smothered chicken with yams and green beans, and order it every time. I always want to sleep off the rest of the day too. Saturday they do a great rib plate. Good spot for those working or living in the city.Visited again but seemed the menu is limited during the weekday.2 1/2 Stars.

After my Daughter's workday, she wanted some Latte at a place in Boca Park.... Wow! Was this place crowded at around 5pm. Stressful work days in Las Vegas, I guess. Didn't want to compete with the crowds during Happy Hour, so we went "off the mall"... Happened upon this "hole in the wall" Gelato place with no one parked in front. Let's try it out...

$4.55 for a SMALL Cup of Gelato about three inches in diameter, about two inches high... At least the owner didn't try to level off the scoops of Gelato.

Wow! Is this place pricey? (Yeoww! Hurts the wallet....)

As many reviewers have commented on, the Gelato at Vivido Gelato is more like Frozen Ice Cream rather than traditional Gelato.... and the main reason for that is the lack of customers here in this smallish strip mall. Most do not realize that (real) Gelato would have to be disposed of if not consumed in a couple, three days... that's the reason for the limited and small volume production of Gelato... the real kind that is. Looks like the Owner, though Italian, has to produce his Gelato this way to save on waste.

Unfortunately, until there is more customer traffic, his present clientele will not be the beneficiary of the "real stuff". Liked the "different" piped-in Italian popular music in the background... "real" Italian...I've been ordering from this restaurant off and on for about a year during my working hours. The delivery is normally in the 20-30 minute range which is good, and the food is good and reasonably priced. The reason I'm rating 3 stars and not 4 however, is because every time I order some  china a Gogo I have to a Gogo to the bathroom, ALOT.The sandwiches here are good, but they're not blow my mind "best  effing sandwich of my lifeeee" good.  

If you're looking for something unique to Vegas and you're on a budget then this is a good place to eat.  If money ain't a thing and you want some real quality food then I'd look elsewhere.  

I had the Montagu and the All American; between those 2 I preferred the All American.  It was moist and flavorful.  

FYI the sandwiches aren't very filling so if you're starving you may want to get 2A pandasal is a pandasal...But this bakery has the best Turon I have ever had...For you that don't know what it is...It's a banana and jack fruit eggroll fried with a glaze on it...Just YUMMY...This place to me was alright. The food LOOK so amazing & tasty, but when it comes to tasting it was alright FOR ME. I'm not a vegan/vegetarian, maybe that's why it wasn't the best to me. Their curry crackers almost made me puke. They tasted like dog treats and looked like dog treats. I ordered a sampler that had different varieties of food. Some of them had herbs, and after eating it a while it made me feel weird. My body is probably not used to it. Who knows! The place is pricy, and the outlook is decent. I love how they have books. I'm a book person. AND OH! Their customer sucks. The lady is just rude. You could tell she hates her job.Me and my husband went to the Montana Meat Co. and had a nice dinner. Our waitress  and the hostess were super nice and very attentive. After finishing our dinner we decided to go to the bar for some drinks and gambling.  This is when we started to wonder if we were invisible. The place wasn't busy yet the bartender completely ignored us. We didn't even get a "be right with you". He walked past us numerous times and finally asked us if we wanted a drink as we were getting up to leave.  My husband cashed out and we went elsewhere to play.  Won't be back.Tempe Markeyplace? Bah! I won't even spell it right it's not even worth the time! So hot in the summer let me tell you, only come here at night. We were wandering around not sure of what the heck to do because it is basically an outdoor mall with all of the same stores. True it is a great place to people watch but do I want to sweat like an animal especially when I'm trying to look hot in my new clothes? Billy is pretty right on the money about everything, but when is he not?Went for Cinco de Mayo drinks and was totally underwhelmed. It wasn't that busy, but the service was horrifically slow, the chips tasted stale, there was no music, and they overcharged us for happy hour drinks. 

They get an extra star since their salsa and margarita's were decent though. I'd agree with the other reviewers here that this place is just okay. There are certainly better restaurants out there.My husband and I saw George Wallace about 12 years ago and laughed our fannys off.  This past weekend we saw him again, expecting a great show.  It was so-so ~ we did LOL a few times but mostly we just smiled.  George admitted that he didn't have a set act and just came out and started talking, which is fine if it's one of those free comedy shows that you only have to buy a drink to see.  But when you lay out  $80.00 per seat + drinks I expect to be entertained and laughing out loud A LOT!   He is worth seeing ~ just don't buy the premium seats ~ and don't waste your money on the drinks!The first time I ever tried Italian ice cream, and at first it tastes weird but then your taste buds love it!  

The prices are horrible though! Small little cup for like eight bucks! I could have gotten a giant milkshake somewhere for that price.It's a nice store, very clean, but over priced.I am torn between a three and a four. She is probably one of a very few number of comedians who doesn't swear. I don't know ! I think just standing up and trying to get a few laughs without vulgar language would be a feat by itself. She is funny in sort of a pg13 kind of way. Probably good if you have teenagers that you want to take to the show with you.The sign says 24 hrs but only open til midnight; 2 am Fri-Sat. That being said they make a wonderful pizza and the $6.95 Xtra large Pepperoni is great. Good NY crust dough style. Perfect for picking up on the way home or out for a work lunch pickup. They do deliver. Only has a few tables for dine in. Great selection means everyone will find something to love. Also good for groups to call in office lunch orders. The only trick is the parking/ getting in there but that's no knock  'cause it's worth the effort.Growing up on New York style thin crust, I'm definitely not an expert on Chicago-style deep dish pizza... But this place just didn't do it for me. I think it was the dough. The flavors were ok, it was just a bit undercooked. It wouldn't stop me from coming back and trying it once more. I think I'll have to call and order ahead though... Ain't trying to wait like an hour again!Visited 5/25/13

We visited for the music event by Ron Matthews.

This is a quiet little wine location. Great for experience a quiet setting while having a bottle of wine.  They have a very limited food menu but do allow you to bring in your own food, which we did.  (See Number One Brothers Pizza Review - in same center.)

Their pricing for bottles of wine are very reasonable. They did not charge a corkage fee.

This is not in my area of travel so would only likely return for another special event.  But it is a nice location and opportunity to experience some nice priced wine and music.My husband saw this restaurant on a list of "burger joints you wish were national" so we gave it a try when we were on our way home from the M.  I guess we didn't realize that Tommy's "big thing" are chili burgers.

The restaurant was pretty empty so service was quick.  It was clean, although it seemed "bare".  The fries were nothing special, and I hoped they would be because I didn't really like the burgers.  

I guess you have to be a chili person... and I'm just not.Ok, it was just OK, our buffet was $22.95 or $23.95 during the week and it was more when I went on Sunday. Bothe days I ate there it was good, just good. Decent variety, but just not quite a 4 star. The Permill in Reno has a 4 star buffett.Mother, sister & I enjoyed this show. We laughed and sang along with the rest of the audience. Intimate theater. Loved the musical parody!Friday night, last minute texts... Let's hit Pin Kaow since we've never been. 8:30, see you there.

We opted to sit on the patio and take advantage of the breezy, cooler summer night and, because of that choice, were seated right away. Bonus!

Water was brought out immediately and our table was dressed for three. The waitress and busser were friendly and helpful, asking if it was our first visit and making recommendations based on what we liked from other places/cuisines.

- Curry puffs
- Edamame
- Thom Ka Koong
- Panang curry (shrimp)
- Pad thai (chicken)
- Garlic (pork)

The puffs were good and reminded me of an Indian samosa (unsurprising, as I believe it's a regional thing). The one part I would have liked to be different was that it have more of a thai flair to it... a twist on the spice, or a sauce? Really tasty, but I wanted something with more curry and more puff.

The edamame was, well, edamame. Needed salt. Still, it was fresh and hot (temperature) and good.

The Thom Ka Koong (galangal, shrimp) soup was tasty. The downside was that I asked for a 7 out of 10 on the spice request (never having been there, I didn't want to go too far without knowing how heavy handed they were)... and what I got was more like a 4-ish. Good soup, bummer on the spice factor. I really think it would have made it pop that much more for me.

The pad thai was about what I expected, plentiful, and the protein was super tender. Not very spicy, but it wasn't mine to order. For the 3 or 4 she requested, it was done right. Decent dish.

The panang was very good. I could have used more spice (again I asked for a 7, got a 4ish), and I would have liked more of the curry sauce for the amount of shrimp and veggies I was given. Don't take away anything, but definitely give more of what I am ordering. Flavors were spot on, texture was perfect, and it was well put together overall.

The garlic pork was beyond tender, heavy on the garlic (yay!) and about the 4-5 spice level he ordered. The veggies were crisp or tender as appropriate and the whole dish was executed well. Definitely some "gotta try this" moments as we passed around forks and shared.

We opted out of dessert and they brought us some really fresh (and creatively presented) cut oranges and other fruit as a refresher. Juicy, fresh, cooling. Perfect.

All that food, and a bottle of wine, and I think it was maybe $100 for the three of us? We were quite happy with what we ate, the service, and the price tag. Not the best in town, but for what it is? Totally A-OK and definitely worth repeating. (And, they deliver? Hmmmm...)As much as i kind of wanted to hate the Sundance cinema, I didn't.  But I didn't love it either.

The weird service fee was kind of ridiculous.  Also weird was that some dude introduced the movie, like we didn't already know what we had paid $13 to go see.   He also got the lead actress wrong (Kate Winslet instead of Cate Blanchett) But, it's kind of awesome that you can booze it up in the theater.  If you can afford it anyway.

When I was there, someone had brought their child in the theater that obviously had Tourette's, and I literally couldn't concentrate at all on the movie, so I left after 15 minutes.  The Sundance people refunded my money and were very nice about it.

All in all, I might go back.  But it wouldn't be my first choice.Nothing strikingly good or bad about this Tex-Mex place

Service is very slow - took us 1.5 hours to get our meal

We had the house pasta - "Was OK, not outstanding, not as good as an Italian restaurant"
Trout salad "tasty"
Stuffed pork loin "average, not alot of flavor and a small expensive meal"
Corn bread was great although not alot was brought out for us to try - but comes with the meal.

Mixed drinks were good

Overall and OK place and might be worth trying again, but only after trying some of the other places around

Expensive for what you get

Nice surroundingsIsland Sushi has a lot of potential to it, but unfortunately to me it seemed like just another ordinary sushi bar. The service here is nice, but it's more of the dishes that are bland. Nothing over the top or colorful. This is more of a neighborhood sushi bar to get your fix with sushi if you're not looking for anything over the top.

Came here twice with a group of friends who sat in the dining area and with a friend who sat at the bar. Both times seating was ready and available. Waitresses were nice and so were the chefs at the bar. The only dispute I have is with the miso soup. Way, *way* too salty for its own good. Everything else tasted great, though. Even though Island Sushi is A-OK, I wouldn't mind stopping by here again if I'm in the neighborhood.My wife and I had breakfast twice at the Miracle Mile location in Las Vegas.
We both ordered the $3.95 breakfast and were happy to find one of the few places that is open for breakfast in the Miracle Mile before 8 AM - it is Vegas Baby.
My wife  ordered the eggs with sausage and I had the ham variation. The sausage was a patty rather than links, which my wife prefers. Included were southwestern style potatoes and choice of corn or flour tortillas. Both breakfasts were adequate and a deal in Vegas. Service was friendly and prompt - at 7:15AM :)they have great drinks and great service... but eat at filibertos before if you want mexican... the food is less than impressive.I went here tonight with a few friends to celebrate our finishing a final. We went for the reverse happy hour and it was alright... not the best, but ok. I got a couple creamy peach saketini that were on 'special' for 6.25. Still pretty steep for the drink. It was tasty, I just thought it was overpriced. I also got the gyoza (on special for 5$) and a house salad. The gyoza were pretty good, I liked the sauce that was on them. The salad was fine... It was just a romaine mix, probably from a bag, with a ginger dressing. I liked the ginger dressing, but it was kind of only on the top of the salad. Overall, it was just ok. The service was also alright, some people didn't get their food when they should have (they forgot someone's dish AND brought out the wrong rice, she ordered chicken teriyaki and said it tasted like the sauce was out of a bottle AND I thought it was ridiculous that they charged like 12$ and gave you dark meat... really? That is insanity. +2$ for white meat.) The prices here were just laughable, if I had gotten a real meal it would have cost at least 10$ but i'd say the average for non sushi was 15$....not worth it.  I would definitely not come back here if it weren't happy hour.Use to love going to happy hour for sushi, but the last time the service was horrible and the sushi didn't taste good AT ALL! Drove me to go somewhere else, so I now go to California Pizza Kitches for food in that area!This is a classic, hole in the wall, average Thai restaurant.  The decor isn't anything too fancy, and the radio blares bad club music.  The walls are decorated with Thai tapestries.  The service isn't especially friendly.  Yep, my kind of Thai restaurant!  Today I ordered the Thai iced tea (which was quite nice, and served in a large glass), the pad see ew with pork, and the spicy fried rice with chicken.  

The pad see ew pork was average, but good.  It might have been a little bit on the greasy side, but not too much.  The only real complaint I had here was that they don't serve Chinese broccoli.  It could have had a bit more flavor to it.  With some chili powder though, that problem was mostly solved.  

The spicy fried rice was different.  It had more of a peppery flavor to the spice, and it was a flavor that I haven't had before in Thai food.  The rice was slightly greasy, but at least the peppery taste provided an interesting flavor.  Other than the unique flavor, there wasn't anything to rave about.  If the overall quality of the food was a little higher, I might have changed my mind on this one.

Overall, I would say Thai Place is a descent enough Thai restaurant, but not somewhere I would go out of my way to get to.  The service was a little bit annoying, and the food was average.Have been to Bourbon Steak a couple of times - first during a stay at the princess - Had an awesome evening, not cheap but worth the money given the company of my wonderful wife. 

The staff are typical zealous to please.

The second occasion was recent during restaurant week. We chose the fixed price menu and a great bottle of wine. - It was too bad that the wine was not left at our table and it seemed to finish up way too soon - I had  the Carpaccio for the first course  which was generous but personally would have preferred a little more seasoning. 

For the second course I chose the steak and short rib combo. Both were very tender, but I liked the steak better than the ribs (which was OK since my date preferred the reverse and we traded). Desert was awesome butterscotch with burnt caramel and an icing dusted donut like cake on the side.

Not bad all in all but comparatively I did not enjoy it as much this time around :-(Food okay, wait staff okay.

Rolls were delish as always. I had the Chili before my meal and that was pretty good. For my main course I had a Steak (strip) and Sweet Potato. That was fine not great as ordered the Steak Med-Rare and it came Med-Well so that kind of ruined that for me. 

Waitress was nice, talked about her kids and the recent snow day they just had from a blizzard that hit them not long before we visited. Can't remember her name but I would give her props if I could, sorry hun!! 

Overall, Texas Roadhouse is Texas Roadhouse, its a chain and if its your kind of thing you will like it. Just not particularly my cup of tea, but good for a change up every once and a while.

Food was not bad and wait staff was friendly, if you just want something different but does not really stand out this could be a place to try. 

Cheer folks!!!Other than the dress code, good drinks and casual atmosphere. Nothing really different here compared to other Blue Martinis. So about the dress code: I know you have an image to keep, but it's Vegas. People go there on vacation. If they wanted to dress up to dance or pay $20 for a drink, they can go to the Mirage.The martinis are slightly better than average; the service is slighlty below average, so it evens out.  Go during happy hour; otherwise, it's not really worth it.  Typically, it's lots of locals, and it's not the Strip, so you definitely could do A LOT worse.Breadfruit is in a small, non-descript building a block from ASU downtown.  If you weren't heading in that direction with the specific intention of going to Breadfruit, you'd never know it existed.  

It's a tiny place, probably seating 15-20 at the absolute max, so i see how it could get packed with a quick influx of people.  On this particular lunch outing around the noon hour, I was one of five diners.  And still it took nearly 45 minutes to get my food.  So don't expect a quick lunch in between business meetings, this place is too laid back for that.  But the service was tremendously friendly.

I got the jerk chicken and it was very well spiced.  Thankfully not overpowering like I've had elsewhere.  it was a nice, hefty sized chicken breast and was very succulent, not dry at all like others have suggested (perhaps other reviewers aren't familiar with traditional dry-rub jerk).  I do wish there was more chutney though, as it was delicious.  The corn, pineapple, and slaw were all a bit flavorless.

The highlight of the meal by far was the carrot juice, which was like drinking a big slice of frosted carrot cake and offset the spicy jerk chicken nicely.

I'm sure I'll go again at some point to try some of the other items, but I'm not into it as a lunch place even though it's close to where I work.  I can get a quicker and just as filling lunch elsewhere for cheaper.(not that a $14 jerk chicken entree and carrot juice is that expensive. . .){Actual Date of Visit: 11/22/11}

I went here with some friends at the suggestion of a classmate who is native to New Mexico.  I had tex-mex food when I was last in N.Mexico and loved it.  I had the Garden Enchilada which was tasty.  I appreciated the fact that they had some nice veggie options and in different sizes.  The Daiquiri was outstanding!  My friend loved her Chorizo Stuffed Chicken but the chili pepper mashed potato was dry.  The waiter was cute and very personable.  He traded out our traditional salsa for the bean dip which was yummy!  Overall it was a good experience, but I would have to go back and try more things to see their range.Aloha upstairs only take cash and they had a line so we decided to go downstairs to eat at the Cal Club.  Not bad but not great either.  Their food is only mediocre and not memorable.  We had their Hamburger Steak and Gravy (no eggs so it's not a loco moco) and that's not bad.  We also had the Chicken Katsu, which was ok.  It was crispy but the chicken breast was a little on the thin and dry side.  Overall it's just ok.  Not great but not bad either.  If you are drunk ,hungry and don't want to wait, then come here.I like the ambiance of this place.....the servers are friendly....The drinks are good too :).....though the sushi is not that great.... I would come back here only for the Drinks :):)Not a bad park at all. The canal path is great to run along and is usually pretty open during the early mornings on weekends. As it gets nice out, it can be filled with bikers, runners and walkers alike.

One downfall, the few times I've tried to stretch on some patches of grass, I've had some unexpected and unpleasant encounters with ants. Stretch on the sidewalk please!!Prices seemed high on the meat and cheese, but I LOVE the pre-made Thai meals.I had the rice bowl with pork during a quick one hour layover. The pork was lean and had decent spice, the onions and peppers were fresh, and the rice was spicy and fresh. The meal came with hot thin tortillas and was a better meal than I expected from a food court stand in an airport. If you eat here though eat this in the airport not on the plane, your seatmates really don't want to smell a Mexican lunch on a cross country flight!The good thing about this restaurant is the food is all local. But unfortunately nothing to write home about. I got the sausage, spinach, aged cheddar scramble. The spinach wasn't"fresh" cut but was long and stringy like a frozen whole leaf spinach would be. Not much cheese noticed. Bread was blah and you had to ask for jam from behind the counter. They took a small container of cold jam out of the refrigerator. Small side of greens was fantastic. It was an expensive breakfast. They should have two $$ under their listing, not one. To top things off they had one unisex bathroom.I don't know if I have to run back here again anytime soon.  Guy behind the cash register was very friendly and very accommodating. Place was very clean & decorated nicely.

Hummus for me was way over processed.  It was as smooth as silk, almost like water.  I think it needed more flavor it was super duper bland. Definitely needed to be thicker and have much more garlic [I didn't even get a hint of garlic].  Pita was nice and warm. Side of Hummus sets you back $3.95 Now that I look at the pix the soupie hummus have been posted so you can see what I mean.

Ordered the chicken Pita with cucumber, tomato, feta salad. My GF ordered the same. Total Bill [with a coupon] was still over $23.00.  Chicken was really flavorful everything else that was in the Pita was pretty bland [once again] we ordered sides of tzatziki to add some flavor. Also, I did not spy any hot sauce anywhere to put on my pita. This is definitely not like the street meat one finds in NYC.  It was average at best.

2 other weird things to note 1) they do have TV's and we got the pleasure of watching ESPN Duck Hunting {WTF?} while we ate...BORING.  2) they had the front doors wide open even though it's still 90 degrees outside which zapped up all the cold AC so it was a little warm in there for our tastes.I enjoyed this hike, and it was fine. I recommend it for younger children, or those with lower levels of mobility, or fitness. The trail was pretty crowded though, loud, with lots of dogs. Because of that, there was very little wild life of any sort. There were also  assorted bags of dog crap lying about here and there on the trail.

Personally I enjoyed the hike to Sunrise Peak much more, it was less crowded and I saw more wildlife.I've been here over 6 times and the food is about the same as the Cheesecake factory. Lunch time is a good time to come because the salads are cheap and the carpaccio is a good portion.

Fish dishes for dinner are quite good. I've tried several and none have been overcooked. That's good for consistency.

There's nothing special about the wine list but the choices are alright. The great thing about this place is the outside seating.Likes: omelette with spinach sausage and mushrooms, hash browns, sourdough bread, orange juice, good service, hot tea with lemon and honey

Dislikes: omelette a bit bland, nothing really wow about this place to me but a good place for a quick breakfastI personally love boba, but I'm very picky when it comes to the perfect consistency. I've been to places that serve boba that's too hard, other places serve boba that's too soft. Haha. Now I sound like Goldilocks. I guess I just didn't realize how difficult it is to cook boba. Apparently, it isn't as easy as I thought. Lollicup is one of the few places that serves perfectly cooked boba and the drink flavors are good as well. My favorite flavor is the Taro milk tea. I wouldn't say theirs is the best I've had, but their Passion iced tea with mango jelly is pretty darn amazing. That drink will keep me coming back for more.Its pricey, your up high and my kid is a thrill seeker.i couldnt go on it but everyone who got off the ride loved it! im scared!!This is probably one of the nicest restaurants at Lake Las Vegas and I ate here many times when I was in the area over a month.  Hummm it has to be described as an Asian fusion restaurant with sushi options.  The food was interesting and sometimes creative.  There were some good flavors in some of the dishes but much of the sushi seemed to be very Americanized.  The prices seemed high for what you got and I found I usually liked the steaks and cooked fish better than the sushi and other Asain "fusion" dishes.  The omakase tasting options were generally good but sometimes a bit too progressive for my tastes.  The best thing about this place is that there never seemed to be a wait and a reservation was never needed.The food is just eh, but it's fun to go here for some Jewish food. Everybody loves their sliders too!Good cocktails, above average sushi and a seductive elegant atmosphere will all be found at this location. Pricey, but what do you expect you're at the Bellagio!Don't let the online menu prices fool you, its definitely very small portions, so you have to order 3x as much to get full. Our bill, with just 2 beers and 2 plum wines, came out to $460 for 4 of us.  The food was ok, we stuck to rolls and appetizers, and the service left a lot to be desired.  The kobe beef appetizer is at least worth trying.Before going to the Coyotes game on Saturday night, my husband and I met fellow Yelper Melissa H and her husband for dinner at Bar Louie. My husband and I have been to Bar Louie in Ohio before, so when we heard there was one at Westgate, we thought it would be fun to eat there. We arrived at 5 pm (game was at 7 pm) and we got there at the perfect time; there were only a few tables already seated, but within 30  minutes of our arrival, the restaurant was getting more crowded and within 45 minutes of our arrival, every table inside was full and there was a growing wait.

Our waitress was nice, but she seriously kept asking us if we wanted to order every three minutes. It got to the point where we had to tell her we would just eat our appetizers and then place an order. Drinks were a little slow coming to the table as well. We had the soft pretzels and chips and dip for appetizers. Both were good; I love how the pretzels are served with a trio of dipping sauces - honey mustard, queso, and yellow mustard - and how they are not too salty, but have just enough salt on them to avoid being bland. The chips also came with queso (seriously can you go wrong with queso??) and two other dips, but our group would have been content with three bowls of queso and not the other two dips. I had the chicken caesar sandwich for dinner, and while the chicken cooked perfectly, there was practically no caesar dressing on the sandwich at all. Like none - the sandwich was almost bone dry. 

Our group of 4's bill came to $135 (before tip) which included 9 beers, 2 appetizers, and 4 sandwiches. For the amount we drank, I didn't think the bill was terrible. The menu isn't going to blow your socks off, but for a casual meal before a game or event at Westgate, Bar Louie is not a bad choice.Finally tried this place today after having it bookmarked for a while. I was pretty spoiled by having my Chinese friends taking me to the best places in Toronto and doing all the ordering...hence avoiding any kind of communication difficulty. We ended up ordering the juicy pork buns, green onion pancake, hot & sour soup (miscommunication on this one--the bf ordered a small for himself because he was the only one who wanted soup, but they brought out a giant bowl enough for 5-6 people. Oh well), fried rice cake with spicy chilis, crispy stir fried beef, boiled shrimp dumplings and an orange sizzling chicken. Yeah, we ordered waaaay too much for the 4 of us. We have a habit of doing that. Guess I know what I'm having for lunch tomorrow! Anyway, the dumplings were pretty good--ive definitely had better, but these did the job. The pancake was yummy and I like the shrimp dumplings. The fried rice cake dish was different than we've had before---the rice cakes were more tubular as opposed to the flatter oval bias cut type I'm used to. It was pretty tasty, but nothing I'm going to crave. The sizzling chicken was a bit too fatty for my taste, but everyone else loved it. I didn't have the beef dish either (which the waitress had recommended), but my parents really enjoyed it. Aside from the soup size miscommunication we didn't have any problems and the waitress was really good about refilling the waters...which is usually not the case at Chinese places for some reason. The service was very good and they were more than happy to package up the leftovers for us. Would definitely come back again when I need my green onion pancake and soup dumplings fix! Plus, the bf really wants to order the squirrel shaped fish dish just to see what the heck that means....Come on, it's chocolate. Everybody loves chocolate. Errrrrrbody. 

So, why no love for Ethel M Chocolate Factory? On the drive there, you're excited like a little Violet Beauregarde and the suspense is terrible... you hope it'll last. It doesn't ... cause this chocolate factory is hardly worth the drive nor the most wonderful place in the whole world! 

It's a short self-paced walk through a hallway with a view of a factory without any oompa loompas or rivers of chocolate. It's some people running machines. We went in the afternoon and there was one person cleaning a machine. The "tour" is guiding you to a gift store with overpriced yet average chocolates. 

If my local supermarket or Costco sells Hersheys, Ghiradelli, Lindt, Cadbury, Ferrero Rocher, Guylian, Godiva, or even generic chocolate then do I really need to go here?

The small Cactus Garden is cool for a couple minutes. Of course, you just drove past a lot of cacti to see it. Of all the sites and attractions in and around Las Vegas, is this really how you want to spend your time? If so, pack up the Wagon Queen Family Truckster and head over.

The most impressive thing about the Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden are the tour buses and cars in the parking lot. They prove that everybody loves chocolate. Ethel doesn't need to be like Willy Wonka and promise a free lifetime supply ... because a small free sample seems to be doing a sweet job.What a pretentious scene!! 

But drinks are decently priced at $6 or $7 for a mixed drink. One bar inside and one bar outside.

They have round beds on their patio that no one seems to sit/lay on...I wonder why. There is a semi-good view of downtown Tempe and the patio is awesome on a warm Arizona night.This place has moved and is not at the address above anymore.  I always enjoyed going there prior for the excellent work, especially considering the price.  The new digs are nicer and the prices are a little higher.  I have always gotten good facials here.  I will return as needed for facials.
However, I didn't have a good experience for scheduling for laser treatments, so I cannot give the place and overall great rating.  In addition, once, my daughter came and had her brows waxed and the job was horrible, with an uneven result, as the instructor did one eye brow and the studen the other.  The student butchered my poor daugher's brow.  I called to complain and got a complimentary facial, but it didn't make up for my daughter's experience.
That said, they are great 99% of the time on the facials.They have good food, it's more ethnic than American, and I like that. 

 The last time I went the waiter gave me my food and disappeared and when I cut into it,  and realized it was the wrong order, he reappeared and before I said anything picked it up and said "that doesn't look like the right enchilada, Sorry about that, I'll go have them make another one correctly." I didn't even open my mouth! So I was touched that he was aware and noticed, at the same time I think it's creepy that he just knew it was wrong. 



Anyways I'm not too fond of this place to be honest, I can't really give you a reason why.We came here for lunch. The place is cutely decorated though a bit faded around the edges. And the seats are hard on the tush!

Three of us all got the same salad so it wasn't a wide sampling of food. But what we got was good, nicely dressed, with a generous portion of chicken.

The waitress seemed a little flighty. She originally brought out soup, realized her mistake, mumbled and walked away. Meanwhile due to that mistake, from the time we ordered until the time we got our food took awhile. It would have been better if she had explained. Or maybe even comped us the soup.

But the menu was inviting enough that I'd go try it a second time.Take a drive down Flamingo Road in Las Vegas and you pass by...Mortons, Ruth Chris, Flemings, Roy's Hawaiian...and SEXXPRESSO?!  We hit the brakes, literally, to do a double take.  So in lieu of Starbucks, we head here out of curiosity more than anything.

Sexxpresso boasts "The Hottest Coffee in Vegas" and is a free-standing structure that is drive-thru only.  We drive up to the window and are immediately greeted by a female barista in a sexy referree costume who was comfortable with our surprised, wide-eyed looks.  I ordered a soy cappuccino which was pretty good.  Less sweet than Starbucks. Their menu has good a variety of smoothies, coffee drinks, and blended ices.  

They aren't open on Sundays. Probably because the female baristas were out dancing the night before at their "other" jobs.  Only in Vegas would this place work.  Worth a pit stop just for kicks!we went here on a monday so it wasn't as crazy as i was expecting. there weren't a ton of people there and barely anyone was dancing, my guess is because it was a monday. we drank a lot before we went because we were expecting it to be like any other day club but when we got there it was the opposite of that. it was nice that there weren't any kids in the pool and everyone there was good looking. i will definitely come here again on a weekend! we also got in for free because we were staying at the mgm grand which was nice because it was $11 for a beer! but hey, what can you expect, drinks are expensive everywhere in vegas.Tshirts and happy hours together!!!

Located in Town Square, this Business is one of those two tone or two ideas rolled into one. Retail and Restaurant rolled into one symbiotic relationship.

I'll start by saying Australia does have Tommy Bahamas, but to tell the truth you would never really know they were there. Most are located in very high volume tourist areas that locals never swing by. So my general experiences have been from this location.

Strolling through the retail section I would say that maybe some of the gear isn't in my age bracket just yet. That's not to say older fashion beach and boating wear isn't cool. "Bow ties are cool" so who am I to judge.

Now for the few happy hours that I been to here. Id like to say I was impressed with the menu and range they had. Sitting out on the patio we grabbed the sliders, seafood tacos
And a Mai Tai.

All were great, the sliders had a great tasting  bun which I was informed was Hawaiian bread. The tacos had a slight spice kick to them with half decent Mai tai that to be honest didn't really hit the mark.

The service wasn't too bad, seating and the server both were prompt delivering dishes and clearing tables with smile. High chairs and a kids menu are also provided but the menu is full of deep fried stuff which I'm not a huge fan of..

Overall
Drinks: 2-5
Food: 3-5
Service: 4-5
Back again: yeah maybe I'll stop by, but there is a few other places Id go to first in town squareI was here on Friday August 21,2009

I was starving as I arrived to Palms Place Hotel, straight from my early morning flight.

My first time @ Palms Place, (pretty snazzy place) 

Simon has a really nice chic appeal I LOVED it!

met my girlfriends @ Simon for a bite. Got there just in time to order......45 minutes later! Party of 4 got served ;-/ 

we had the roasted chicken salad sandwich, black angus burger with tuscan fries, margherita pizza & classic caesar salad 

food had really nice presentation but was cold by the time it reached our table. (an apologetic waiter) i may add. 

don't know what the hold up was all about. it wasn't busy at all.

the yogurt parfait looked SOO good but didn't feel like waiting 45 minutes.

I would return and edit my review :)If you're from a Tier1 city on the East or West coast, this city is a major fail.  If you come from, say, Chattanooga, TN, or anywhere equally as appalling such as anywhere in-between Philly and Los Angeles, this city will probably be a step up for you.

PROS:
----------
Friendly people.  Beautiful sunsets.  Beautiful desert scenery.  Cheap rent.  Beautiful weather 6mos out of the year.  Pretty decent Magic the Gathering scene.  Wonderful family.  

CONS:
-----------
A big percentage of people here are radical Christians and loony Mormons waiting for their spaceship to the planet Kolob (look it up).

There are a lot of chain restaurants and you've really got to search high and low for decent eats.  Unfortunately, most Phonecians enjoy Applebees over, say, a great Cajun eatery. 

The music scene is laughable, at best.  When the weekend's headline event is "Hardcore is a Girl's Best Friend", and when you go to a desert party with 2 stages of Hardcore, you know you're in trouble.  The city's DnB weekly draws crowds in the single-digits, and most events, sound-wise, are utter failures.  For instance, bringing out a huge UK DnB DJ then having the sound cutting out and clipping all night, awesome!  Want to hear Glitch?  bawahaha, good luck.  How about DubStep?  woooo!  If you're lucky you can catch the DubStep _monthly_... yes folks, 1x's a month.  Awesome.  There is literally only one weekly that's worth anything and it's the Pound which has been going strong for 1yr.  Sadly, you see the same 100 people at every event worth anything.  So in a city of 5million or whatever, 100 people know and support good music.  *sigh*  Want to hear a sick DJ like DJ Dan, Donald Gladue, DJ Icey, etc....?  Well you have 1 option:  wade through the sea of douchebaggery at Myst filled with the worst of Scottsdale and the Scottsdale wanna-be's with their $200 jeans and $150 bling t-shirts with no clue that a world-class DJ is on the decks.... THEN, you will be sadly disappointed as you watch your favorite DJ spin a watered-down set on a shitty sound system.  Sweet.

Art?  "Hellz yeah we have First Friday".  Yeah, 1x's a month, there's something artsy to do.  Tits.

Public transportation?  Yeah, the people of The Valley voted for the Light Rail project... a BILLION dollar debacle which provides Phonecians a single route from Mesa up to Phoenix, at a cost of $2.50 for a r/t.  Is it cheaper than driving?  No.  Faster than driving?  Nah.  More convenient?  Nope.  Does it go anywhere useful?  Naw.  It serves only a tiny fraction of our population, mainly those that find it "hip" to live in Downtown Phoenix.  How about the bus?  Don't know, I've never seen a bus in Gilbert.

Weather?  Miserable... you are forced to live in an artificial environment 6months out of the year because it's too hot to have a window open, too hot to even go outside.  Sure there's a lot of nice outdoors activities, but you can only participate 1/2 the year.   Don't let people fool you and tell you "it's a dry heat".  I don't care if it's dry or not, 117 degrees is 117 degrees.  OH, and don't expect it to cool down at night.... 100 degrees at MIDNIGHT is actually common.  And btw, it's not always a "dry heat"... most of the summer is Monsoon season.  You actually begin to look forward to the monsoons.

How does Phoenix's weather effect your body?  Well, if you enjoy not being able to breathe, sneezing, watery eyes, bloody noses, burning your flesh on your leather seats, Valley Fever, and respiratory issues, Phoenix is the place for you!

Job market?  Awesome, if you enjoy working for a call center.

Cops?  Super!  We've got the anti-Constitution, racial profiling, show-boating, murdering Joe Arpaio.  If you are caught with even a roach or a stem of weed, you're looking at a trip to Tent City where you can enjoy our 117 degree weather from the comfort of an outside bunk bed under a canvas tent.  If you're brown and working hard to support your family, expect for your place of business to be raided, and for you to be arrested and detained, probably even deported.

Drivers?  The drivers in Phoenix are fascinating to watch and observe.  They paint the perfect picture of mental retardation.  Everyone tailgates here, going 70mph.  I defy anyone to drive 20miles on our freeway systems and not see a rear-end accident.  Multiple rear-end accidents happen daily.  Why?  Because people drive at 70mph literally inches from the car in front of them.  Now any person with an IQ over 70 would be able to understand that if the car in front of them has to stop suddenly, you are guaranteed to get into an accident.  GUARANTEED.  I am baffled and literally astounded at the fact that no one seems to understand that out here.We tried to stay away from chain restaurants on our recent trip to the Phoenix area, but relented when we saw Cracker Barrel. There are times when I really can't turn down a chicken fried steak and this was one of them.

Service was good here. My drink never went dry. The other customers were what I always expect from a Cracker Barrel, no matter what part of the country I go to.

Food was good. Nothing wowed me, but everything had good flavor and I ate it all, so I guess that says something. 

They were really close to the new Cubs Park, so it was a good place to go after the game.This location is really nice. Spacious, clean, friendly, etc. 

The donuts are just like any other kripsy kreme. They are small, dense, doused in glaze. A guilty treat but honestly not the best donuts. If you haven't had them before, you might try it just to see the hype but fresh hand made donuts from mom and pop shops are waaaaaaay better.The food is great but how come you don't fill my bowl.  In fact, at my most recent visit, I asked for them to fill my bowl.  The response wasn't a polite and curteous one, it was an informative and rude to me as a customer.  They did proceed to fill my bowl but the proportions were way off.  The guy behind the counter said that I received the correct amount but my buddy got a different amount than me, so which is right?

When it comes down to this place, I love the food but I need a full bowl.  I ordered a burrito bowl, not a burrito half bowl.I was kinda disappointed with the food. I understand $1.89 breakfast can't sustain paying the bills if business is down. We arrived looking forward to our favorite Deuces Wild breakfast but found a fifties themed diner with a whole new menu. We're happy to try something new.  The restaurant is called Mary's Diner. It's cute and thankfully the old servers are still there. Lupe is a doll, has been here for 22 years! 

So the prices went up, my Skillet was $6.99,which is not a bad price, but I was hoping it would taste good too but it was really bland instead. There is less of a breakfast selection, gone are the old favorites. No substitutions either. Talk about corporate menu unfriendliness. 

I do hope corporate makes a few tweaks to improve the food. I like the service and the servers here. They've all been here a long time and we would have fun razzing them when they wore a football jersey from an opposing team. That's gone too. :-(I thought the selection here was above and beyond my expectations, albeit priced according to resort standards. The breakfast buffet was breathtaking and even offered gluten-free donuts and several other delicacies. The space is large and serving staff are helpful and don't hover uncomfortably. 

Dining on the patio was also great - drinks were replenished constantly and everything tasted great. The bathrooms nearby are always clean and well-stocked.

Watch out at the egg station - the cook is a bit too easy pouring on the oil. That's the only thing I didn't finish.

I came here during the "off" season so the place was nearly empty. Definitely wouldn't come here if it was busy as I imagine it would be too loud.I have been here a few times and it has been really great. The food is always really great and it's a nice place to enjoy a beer. It is very loud in there when busy with the open layout they have it gets very volumized like a cafeteria. Also, my server was rude the last time I was there, she looked like she hated life and her job. Otherwise it is a great place and I like to come here."I'm here to pump u up!" My favorite la fitness, maybe bc its close to home or maybe bc there's lots of fat chicks!!Shane's Rib Shack has been a longtime tenet of Westgate, but despite all the events I've been to at Jobing.com Arena and University of Phoenix Stadium in the last several years, I actually have not eaten there.  That finally changed before yesterday's Coyotes game.

Shane's is what it is.  Fast food Barbecue.  Not the best food I've ever had, but certainly not something that would regret.  The "Big Dad" is a nice big pile of barbecue pork between two big slices ofTexas Toast.  I really didn't care for the buttery taste of the toast, but the pork itself was very flavorful, and shane's "secret" sauce is wonderful.  It has a sweet flavor with a slight kick.  As a regular combo, it's about $8 for the sandwich plus a side and a drink.  I had the potato salad which was just okay, and decided to try their sweet tea.  If you love sweet tea, you'll probably really love Shane's.  If you're like me who poured my drink "half and half" (with a ratio closer to 60% unsweetened and 40% sweetened) and still felt that it was way too sweet, I'd recommend you steer clear.

Shane's is good stop before heading to an event at the stadium or arena.  Or somewhere to eat before or after hitting up a movie at the AMC.  But like everything else in Westgate, I wouldn't recommend it as something to go out of your way to try.Update. The Manager, Eric gave me a call after my posting and said they were still investigating.  He thought that I was contesting the charge, ie. that I was saying I didn't use my my card. He stated he had me on video during the transaction.   I clarified that I wasn't contesting the transaction.  I was complaining about the attempted use of my card immediately after the transaction by persons unknown in China and Las Vegas.  I told him I would return to 99 Ranch to try to clarify my position.  

In the meantime I had to cancel my card and have a new one sent at my cost because I wanted it ASAP.  Xmas shopping!

I returned the store on Monday, a week after the incident and met Eric's assistant Simon, a courteous young man.  He showed me the video of my transaction which I acknowledged and confirmed that the complaint was not about the transaction but of the attempted fraud that took place.  He told me that the cashier only had my card and ID for a brief moment and it would not be possible to record the information in such a short time.  Whatever the case, the fact is that my card was used in several attempts within a couple of hours after having paid for my goods at 99 Ranch.  That was the only time I had used the card in weeks as I had just returned from a trip overseas and had driven directly to the store from the airport. I did not use the card before or after that transaction. The perpetrators obviously had access to my information some way.  

I am not saying that 99 Ranch was involved in the fraud attempt.  I am saying that people should be careful when using their cards in all establishments as the identity thieves are very sophisticated in their techniques.

I still shop at 99 Ranch as they have a great selection of produce and sea food and it's one of the few places one can buy thinly sliced rib eye for hot pot or sukiyaki.  It's also the only place I know that will steam your crabs (they have a great selection).We went to celebrate a classmate's birthday and had a really good time.  I adored the tableware: it was heavy and had a "medieval" feel.   The lunch special is a really good deal.  I'm not a fan of paneer and that was the day's veggie lunch special, so  I got the veggie wrap instead.  It was excellent!  So were the fries (more fries please!).  The waitresses weren't that personable and although the lunch special includes dessert, they asked my friends if they still wanted it.  Huh? I didn't have a lunch special, so I used my handy dandy Yelp check in offer for a free dessert, so I could get some rice pudding.  I've been eating rice pudding all my life and have had many different versions.  Liquidy rice pudding? No thanks.  Thank God we had a terrific birthday cake.Good....not great. 

Overall OK food but rather average for the price. Buffalo chicken burger was good, but not $12 good when it doesn't come with anything on the side. Also, my chicken burger was skimpy on the toppings. Sweet potato fries on the other hand were quite delish! They were enough to share between two people. I didn't get a chance to try the milkshakes but they looked amazing. 

The service was slow. The place crowded consistently. I'd come back but would probably be inclined to try something different.Their staff isnt the nicest.

Good taps, good shepherds pie, bad fish and chips.

A great place to go on St Paddys though.Don't  let the strip mall location and tacky interior stand in your way of getting some good value Indian food.  The lunch specials are hearty, tasty, and reasonably priced....the bollywood on TV is a freebie.  The service is great and the new ownership go out their way to make your stay efficient and pleasant.  A great lunch spot to mix up the day to day melange of sandwiches and burgers.The rating on this particular experience has me questioning my previous reviews because how can i give Geno's Chowder & Sandwich Shop a 3 star rating and J.R. a 3 star rating.  I had the Sixteen Course Degustation Menu.

If this restaurant was called Geno's Chowder & Sandwich Shop it would have been a 5.Nothing to rave about, it was good. My first time here.They open at 10:30 but like to let the line build up lto look ike its actually busy til almost 11.  Their promoters SUCK!!! If you ever get approached by a short girl named Sara do NOT believe a word she says.  We were told that we would get in 4 free which was a given and she would give us a wristband that would get us free drinks until midnight.  Sounds great right?  Total lie.  They just say that so you can go and b like f* it we're already here.  Little snake! 

Music was GREAT though. DJ did an awesome job. Boo 4 no Lil Wayne beeing played.  Our whole group had a really good time.  The place itself was pretty big. 2 rooms.  The go go girls sucked though.  They had no rhythm and were wearing fake blond wigs that kept fallin out and just looked horrible. 

Overall they get the 3 stars bc our group had a great time. The music was good and 1 for the club size itself.Lately, I've been occasionally hitting the LVAC on Sahara.  Several times, I see the Johnny Fontane's Beach House sign and resist the urge to give it a try since i'm still on my work out high.  yesterday I gave into the temptation since I was starving during my entire work out.  As soon as I got into my car, I pull up the Yelp app, find JFBH and call in an order.

Ordered a small sausage pizza and a meatball sub - cost together - $16.50, very reasonable.  Told food will be ready in 20 minutes.

After calling in order, I continued sitting in car returning a few calls and texted the gf. 

After 20 minutes, I drove all of 50 yards parked in front of JFBH and went in with the drool starting to build up.

A few guys playing pool, creating a smoke cloud and drinking a few beers.  One other barfly at the end of the bar shooting the bull with the bartender.  I look around the bar and try to figure out why the place is called a "beach house " - oh well.  The bartender comes up, tell her I called in an order.  She leaves bar to check my order - she comes back to tell me a few more minutes and asks if I want a drink - I politely decline.  The bartender was pleasant.  I sit down - a few more texts, check a few websites on my phone, about 10 minutes go by.  The bartender comes over and says she'll check on my order.  She comes back and says a few more minutes.  She gives me the check and I pay.  Another five minutes goes by and she comes back with my order.

First thing I notice is how heavy the bag is on top of the pizza - geez, what is this sammie made of - lead ??

Get home with the food.  I like that they provide ranch dressing presumably for dipping the fries in.  The fries have that slight coating that provides greater crunch.  Decent sized sammie.  The meatballs ?  Very dense, juicy but I'm curious if the meatballs are actually "homemade" ( not that anyone represented to me that they were ) - overall, ok.

The pizza - good sized for a small - light on sausage. Sauce is good, crust, decent.  Overall, an ok pizza especially for the price.

I have a feeling i'll return ( post work out )

pics attachedI loved how classy the place was, the ceasar salad could have been much better, but the pesto pizza was delicious. The service was a little slow, we waited around a bit for our waters and our check. Overall it was great for a late night dinner!place was packed.  we were told 20 minute wait but ended up being an hour.  the manager bought us a drink in the meantime, though, which was nice, especially with their prices.  almost impossible to get a drink at the bar.  loud and annoying house music blasting and douchebags and douchebaguettes abound, but the food was good and the menu interesting.

worth a try when you've got $300 free to blow on dinner for two, which i always do...I couldnt hold out any longer and finally came out to a nightclub for the 1st time since being a new Las Vegas resident. I had heard about Lavo before (I always thought it was a pool... kinda like Wet Republic) but never went. Also, the thing about Vegas is, if youre a dude and you wanna go out to these popular nightspots with your boys (and plan to get in in a decent amount of time) you either gotta 1. spend $$$ like theres no tommorro 2. get lucky (walk in with some girls you just met, come up with some bs story about how you know someone there, etc) 3. come in late (past 130 or so) 4. or have a hookup.... Fortunately we had a hookup so off we went.

The downstairs (restaurant) part of lavo is nice. They were giving us appetizers and drinks (on the house) all night, so no complaints there. A sizeable group of saints fan (congratulations!) were at the bar partying up. At about 11:30 we walked out and walked right past the line to the club (thats were the hookup comes in handy). Lavo reminds me alot of The Bank Nightclub at the Venetian. SMALL. We had bottle service, but there was no rope to keep away the straglers, so everyone was just mixed in (just like at The Bank nightclub). I thought the whole point of bottle service was to have your own space? The DJ was beyond terrible. I kid you not he did not play one song that was made after 2004 until right before I left. Just all Lil' Jon songs. Im not a DJ, never have been, and probably never will be, but I could have came up with a better list. The chick who won the first season of "For The Love of Ray J" (I think her name was cocktail?) is a gogo dancer there. I mean I had fun I guess, but there are definitely better places.Looking for some huge croissants?  This place has it.  Big desserts and coffee with an even bigger price tag at this joint.  But hey, we're at the Bellagio where prices are expected to be high.  Palio is located across from the Gallery of Fine Arts.  Inside, you'll find a well decorated, spacious, and even a semi-quiet cafe.  Palio has your coffee's, latte's, iced coffee's, desserts, bagels, muffins, cookies, sandwiches, croissants, and even some pre-made sushi.  All are priced to profit and people buy it. 

I admit, I am not the biggest fan of Palio with the main reason being price.  The cheapest item on their menu is their basic Americano for $4.50.  Think about it.  Starbucks carries this for $2 and we all know they are priced high too.  But when you have that 2:30 feeling, you do what you got to do.  

Service is just okay and if they were above and beyond, I'd probably up the stars to 4.  As of now, just 3 stars meaning Palio is just okay.Your basic, friendly hole-in-the-wall gay bar, with good, cheap drinks. My friends call it "Cheers for Queers", and if you're a regular, everybody knows your name.  A bit more macho than most; catering to the traditionally masculine guy, you see lots of blue collar types; but everyone is made welcome by the friendly bartenders. As mentioned in other reviews; it can be very smokey if it is crowded.As far as Targets go this one is okay. Sometimes I walk in here and it's a mess, other times everything is perfect and in place. The flip of the coin is what stops me from giving it anything other than an "okay". 

The one thing I like about this Target is that it does have Starbucks inside it. It's nice to go for a Target shopping trip and be able to get a nice beverage on the way out. 

I don't know if this happens to anyone else, but it seems to always happen to me and it ticks me off all the time. I'll be standing in a checkout line and a Target employee will tell me to go to the customer service counter to check out. As I'm walking over there someone zips in from the front door and has a lengthy exchange process to be taken care of and  I have to huff and puff myself back to the regular checkout aisles pissed off. 

Let's leave the normal customers in the checkout lines okay Target?As I rushed through the depths of Mandalay Bay, late for one of my closest friend's wedding I started to get out of breath - where was THE chapel??? These 3-inch heels aren't going to make it much further.

After what was a good ten minute sprint we arrived, heaving oxygen into our lungs to a lobby decorated in dark wood and creamy colors.  The smiling receptionist told us our wedding party was located in the "gold" room.  Seems as if this facility has two or so rooms on each side so they can accommodate many ceremonies. 

The rooms are pleasant enough - the theme of dark wood/creams follows through and behind the pulpit there is a big window that can look out to some tropical foliage.  Our particular room looked like it could've held about 35-50 people. Honestly it occurred to me at one point they looked a little funereal (which I guess some people think when they are getting married, death of being single and all)  There is a piano in the back where my friend had a player come in to play the bridal entrance as well as provide some background music during the vows.

What I did like was the bride and groom rooms. Now of course when you think Vegas you think Elvises and drunken "I dos" and "did I just do that?" the next morning, but this was straight out elegant.  My friend had a nice, quiet place to dress, do her make-up and try to calm those pre-wedding nerves.

The ceremony itself of course was beautiful and I would put some photos up --oh wait, we weren't allowed to film video or take stills during the vows because of course on top of the package they had already sold the couple, they wanted to be able to get plenty of add-ons out of them. Fine, dandy, I guess you can make your money but if we want to take shots from our point of view I don't know why that's a big deal. (Although my view was marred by tears the whole time)    The officiator was very nice and ran the vows perfectly, stopping to give my girl time to wipe her tears and compose a little so she could say her personal vows.

All in all definitely my friend's sleek style and the package deals seemed pretty good - you know, if you are the 1% who comes to Vegas sober and planning to wed.....Not bad at all. Its a bar so expect under trained employees and staff. Foods good when it comes out and beers cold. Good for kids and families before 9pm. Come check it out. Better than native new Yorker.Pretty good, except for the black hair in my rice and the sole waitress/cashier  on the dinner shift who looked like she was annoyed that we were ordering something. It was about 7 p.m. Too bad.This is a solid joint for mexican food. It's not gourmet, but it's not a total dive either.

I stopped in for dinner last week with my Dad, and we sat down in the dining area (non-smoking). Very quickly, the room started to smell like someone was smoking weed. Of course, I pretended to not know what the smell was, but my Dad caught my lie. That turned into an awkward dinner conversation. Oh well.

The server was very kind and offered to move us to the bar area, without us asking.

In any case....when you are seated, you get a nice plate of chips, salsa, and bean dip.

The food is quite good. Lots of options. There is a "healthy" menu, as well as a "seniors" menu. 

I opted for the Chicken Sarandeado. A grilled chicken breast that was nicely seasoned, served with tortillas, rice, beans and pico. 

Nothing about this place stands out as life-changing, but this place is A-Ok and I would come back because the service was good, the food was good, and atmosphere was fun.

Salud!I stayed mid-week.  The hotel lobby is very chic.  I had a standard King room.  When I opened the door, I was practically on my bed.  The rooms are very small however, they make use of every inch.  The decor very contemporary and Asian influenced.  Found it interesting that there is no coffee maker in the room but several bottles of liquor and a 'kit' for intimacy along with prepackaged snacks.  

One of my bath towels was stained with some caked on green stuff like wax.  The bed was really comfortable.

The pool is for watching young people getting tipsy and doing canon balls (the pool is only 3 1/2 feet deep).  But the service is good.

Upon check out, I called for a bellman and after 25 minutes of no-show, I had to call again and wait another 5.  Disappointing.

I wouldn't stay there again unless it was free.High blood pressure folks, watch your sodium in-take at the District.

I had high hopes coming here.  Nice looking place, friendly staff, impressive menu.  I gave it a shot... because, really, there's no way I'm stepping foot in the Hooters across the street.

I have this thing with scallops, so when I saw it listed on the menu it was no contest.  However, listed underneath was "mushrooms, peppers, grilled Italian sausage."  Sausage?  Oh dear, but I don't eat pork.  I asked  the waitress if there was anyway I could substitute the sausage for the grilled asparagus listed under the sides portion of the menu.  She explained that the scallops were served on top of a mixture of the three items, but I could choose to have it served on top of the asparagus instead.  Sure, why not.  That sounds good.  I also ordered the baked tomato soup because of all the great Yelp reviews and good lookin' pictures.

While I was waiting for my food, the bread and butter came out.  The bread was sprinkled with what I think was fancy sea salt.  Neat... but was this possibly an indicator of the meal to come?  Soon thereafter, my soup came out.  I didn't even get tomato soup when I was a kid, but I feel like this soup brought me back to childhood.  It was creamy, not over-seasoned at all, and the cheese on top was just right.  I suggest saving one of your dinner rolls to dip in it and you, my friend, have quite the meal.  

The soup was pretty hot, so it took me some time to finish it and by then, my scallops were ready.  My bowl was taken away and in it's place were my scallops... in the oddest shaped bowl/dish I've seen.  It was like a huge bowl with an asymmetrical curve so that it's like your food is performing for you in a mini-amphitheater.  It's great for presentation, but a pain to actually eat off of.  I had a hard time resting my utensils on it and it left no room to use a knife and fork.  Made me long for the days of plates and flat surfaces.  The scallops themselves-- 3 huge ones-- were seared to perfection on top of a bunch of supposedly grilled asparagus.  However, EVERYTHING on the plate was overly salty.  I thought maybe my switching of the other ingredients had somehow upset the balance of the poor scallop.  Was this sodium fiasco my fault?  I asked for more bread to counteract the over-seasoned saltiness of it all.  Alas, my efforts were in vain.  It was just too salty.  I went through 2 glasses of water and 2 dinner rolls.  My server apologized and asked if there was something else I would like instead, but by then I was too full from the water and bread that I just asked for dessert.

My server came back with the menu and as an apology, she said dessert was on the house.  Horray!  I wanted something nice, so I asked her what the prettiest dessert was (I'm a sucker for plating).  She suggested the apple pie, whoopie pies, and since she was a chocolate lover, the chocolate cake called "Heaven Can Wait."  Wow, really?  I'll have that. 

The chocolate cake was simple but decadent, drenched a rich ganache and.. a sea salt chocolate stick? C'mon, what's with the salt?!  Nonetheless, I still throughly enjoyed the chocolate... it was the perfect amount of sweetness to balance the salt.

All in all, I expected more than what I got.  One pleasant at the end of my meal was the free cotton candy with my check... one not so pleasant surprise was the $1 charge for the distilled water I was served.  Great staff, very friendly, but I'll come back just for the soup.This one is hard. The whole place is conflicted between excellence and douchetasticness.

THE GOOD (aka: the food)
If you've been to another Roku, or even a Nobu, the menu will look familiar, as will the prices.

The sushi selection was pretty deep, with a good specials list, and lots of options. All the fish was very fresh, and as good as you can get in Phoenix, unless you're a regular somewhere else and get the special stuff. My benchmark for this is 'saba'. Usually, if you're not a regular somewhere, you get the dried out, pickled-herring tasting stuff. But Roku sent out the good stuff. Moist and delicious.

The sushi rice was excellent. Some of the portions were a bit awkward, with the rice ball minimized maybe to make the top portion seem larger...? But very good. I would sit at the bar next time.

The hot and cold plates were of the standard "inventive new japanese" type, but very well executed.


THE OKAY (aka: the bar)
Decent selection of beers and sake. Some frou frou specialty cocktails. But if you can't make a Vodka Tonic, you're fired. That wasn't tonic. Sent it back, came back again. Not tonic. 1 of 3 things going on here:

1) waitress screwed up twice (doubtful, she seemed competent and sober)
2) bartender screwed up twice
3) tonic is on tap, and tap was screwed up and only delivering carbonation and no syrup. if so, the bartender isn't checking the taps - see #2 above.

I like a Vodka Soda too, so I let it slide and didn't send it back again.


THE UGLY (aka: the overal l experience)
Normally, a W hotel is a chill spot in every city. You can count on upscale and relatively low key business/pleasure travelers, great service. Cool vibe. But I'm afraid this W will be plagued by the same velvet rope bullshit that haunted the James and Mondrian when they first opened. 

We scurried through the lobby and were greeted by a nicely scripted hostess (who knew how to work the reservations system), and an Atlantic City magician in a Sushi Roku host's suit (who didn't know how to work the reservations system). Guido act in full effect. At least he didn't punch us in the face or anything. Probably not fair to judge him. I'm sorry. He's probably a nice guy, but the demeanor doesn't fit the place. I would be floored if he could point to Japan on a map. Or if he punched me in the face.

The decor is very upscale, modern and generally over-the-top, but well done.

Then as we get escorted in...
Host bellows a Jersey Shore approximation of "Irrasshai!", to which all 3000 or so staff bellow back "IRRASSHAI!!!" This happens EVERY FUCKING TIME a new party is seated. The only thing louder was the table of seemingly underage rich kids getting hammered for someone's 19th birthday. "We're bombin, dude!" I think "bombin" means ruining both your sake and beer by mixing them in the same glass. The table was out of control and acted like they were at a Super Sweet 16, but were not approached by mgmt, as far as we could see. 

Elsewhere, cougars on the prowl. Some horrified rich people. And some troubled foodies.


OVERALL
The food was very good . The experience was pretty cheesy. Some of the staff must find it hard not to chuckle when they're trying to prepare and serve A+ dishes. They need to tone it down to keep a return business. The sake bomber crowd isn't gonna keep coming back at $100/head, and fine diners don't want their conversations (and even thoughts) drowned out by Vegas theatrics, unnecessary "security" and obnoxious guests. The servers are very young and inexperienced, and still in script mode. They need to be able to read when a table doesn't need to be taught about a menu. But I imagine the ones who make it will relax and hit a groove if management lets them.

We'll head back to the bar on a week night, as far away from the "show" as possible, and enjoy some sushi.It was Ok.  Was too hungry to wait at the Bellagio 1 hour buffet line so came over to Aria and had no wait.  They served Lobster which was cold by the time we got it and the food was just ok.  Some hit and misses.  Shrimp/Dessert/some chinese food were delicious.  Other things were just ok or bad like the overcooked fish.

I expected better from a $40 buffet and explains why the place had no wait and plenty of openings during dinner.First off, I feel bad giving this place just three stars. After reading all the reviews, I was really hoping to like it a lot more than I did. I've heard for months from friends and fellow yelpers about how awesome this place is, so we decided to give it a try for early Vday dinner. 

The atmosphere is very very nice. Nice little cottage with a kitchen (where they have a few tables next to the chef), a dining area, and an outside patio area. There are lots of candles and can be romantic place. The waiters were all nice, but we had some issues with the service. A group of 4 that came 20mins later than us(just 2) sat next to our table and kept getting food quicker than us. The most annoying part was that the waiters kept telling us our food would come, but the speed and service was definitely lacking. 

As for the food, it was definitely worth 3+ stars except for the main chicken pesto dish. It was just two butterflied chicken pieces with pesto sauce, no vegetables, no special sauce, nothing special. I did love the appetizer 1 (white bean soup with side of bread with asiago cheese), appetizer 2 (barley and poached shrimp w/ sweet asian chili sauce), and one of the main dishes (pork tenderloin with a sweet chutney/hint of curry sauce and asparagus). The dessert was just some strawberries and fudge brownie. Again, nothing special.

All in all, I did like the experience, but the food left me thinking there could have been more or that it could have been better. Maybe I went in thinking too highly of this place. I am willing to give it another try, but it's not #1 that I would recommend to a friend.

** I wanted to add something. Chris, the owner of the restaurant sent me an apology via email and phone call. This says a lot considering chefs will get very offended if you talk remotely bad about their food/creations. I have to admit. I feel bad if I seem very cruel in my review, but I feel that I was not over-exaggerating anything. I like to think that I speak the truth and hopefully readers can appreciate that. One last thing.. Chris pointed out to me that the chicken pesto had provolone cheese and spinach. I am sorry Chris, I have a dull palate. 

Again, i would like to try cafe monarch again and will update on my next visit!Very tasty I had the house chicken and my wife had the kung pao chicken.  For desert we ordered shaved ice and the pineapple topping was sour from being too old or left at room temperature too long.   So it was good, but the desert was a disappointment.5/29/10
Came in after a failed attempt to dine at Zin Burger next door (I ended up ordering only the sweet potato fries there- not good.  Very soggy.).  Nice friendly greeting at the door, and I was seated right away.  (Sad to see TFK's business was much slower than that of ZB's.)

Ordered my favorite, the onion tart, but I also wanted to try something new- the Columbia River steelhead salmon, which the menu promised it comes with shiso (red or green leafy greens), lime, avocado (hold the avo, please!), and cilanto aioli.  It is served on the bread made in-house.  For dessert, I tried the chocolate muffin/cake w/ organic butter ice cream, organic chocolate sauce, and cocoa nibs (!).

The salmon sandwich was excellent!!  Everything that comprised this sandwich was fabulous, from the whole-grain and veggie bread and the lime and cilantro aioli slathered on it, to the oh-so-moist medium-rare salmon, tomato, and the not-so-usual leafy topping, shiso.  It took all my willpower to not eat the entire thing!  I wish I could say the same about the kale salad and sweet potato hash...  The kale was so tough to chew.  However, chewing wouldn't have been such a task if the kale wasn't also very dry!  My salad was pretty rough, so I abandoned it right away.  [I know that kale is SO VERY good for me, but sometimes what's good for my health isn't so great for my digestive system :( ]  I wasn't a fan of their hash in the past, and tonight's side dish didn't win me over, either.  I won't give it another chance.  Another disappointment was the onion tart.  First, the presentation left me wondering who took a chunk off my plate and ate it?  No, this was just how it was assembled and baked, I was told.  Variances, he said.  The exquisite crunch I so loved in this pizza was gone, and so was the flavor.  Very bland.  Another menu item I must cross of my list :( 

Oh, but the dessert!!  Very moist cake, which sat on silky, rich organic dark chocolate sauce, with lovely (!) crushed cocoa nibs- loved that crunch!  I think I surprised my server by guessing correctly what those nibs were!  (I've had them before in trail snack bags from Whole Foods.)  The best part?  Why, the homemade butter ice cream!  I need to go back and have another scoop (or two!) very soon...

Excellent service- very informative.  Kudos to my server who never showed impatience after having to answer all of my questions- some of which he had to go back to the kitchen a few times, too!  Thank you very much!Was taken by friends after we got a $5 off coupon at 13th floor. it was not as scary but had it's moments. very dirty and the crawl spaces were a bit much! you need to have an alternate route for people to take, do not like crawling in dirt on my hands and knees! If you have asthma, STAY AWAY! Not for you! Dirt and dust everywhere!Ohana's is walking distance from my house.  If I were to rate this place relative to other Hawaiian spots in Las Vegas I would say it's better than L&L bbq and doesn't quite reach the standards of Aloha kitchen.  I'll review a couple dishes that I get on the regular:

BBQ Beef Bowl:  Awesome bang for your buck.  At $4.95 you get a fist full portion of teriyaki beef on top of steamed veggies and rice.  I have a pretty big appetite and this dish always leaves me satisfied.

Chicken Katsu:  The chicken katsu is right on par.  They use all white chicken.  If you like a little dark meat in your katsu you may get sick off all the white meat.  The katsu sauce is just right.  Not to different than most places which I like.  Really can't go wrong.

BBQ Beef Plate:  The bbq beef plate was just okay.  BBQ Chicken....good, BBQ Beef....good, Kalbi Beef...not so good.  I think what really killed this plate was the Kalbi.  How do you make Kalbi wrong?!  Well, if you don't marinade it long enough and the Kalbi doesn't taste like, well...Kalib!

So, anyhow, Hawaiian food is like a staple to my diet as well as a great way to maintain my high cholesterol.  If you are in the area it's a great place to stop by and pick up food or have dinner with the family.  However, It's not really a place you would go out of your way for.

I'm really glad that they are in business serving some go ol Hawaiian food.It's central, and it's cheap. You can't really ask for much more in a pub.

It's right on the corner of the Royal Mile and North Bridge, so it does get it's fair share of tourists in, but as it's part of the Student Recommended chain it also gets its fair share of the younger crowd in too.

The décor is surprisingly elegant and classy, it's all dark oak and polished metal, but my one criticism of this place is it's size. I've never been a big believer in the whole 'good things come in small packages' thing, and this bar isn't exactly huge. In fact, the freestanding bar in the middle of the lower section takes up more room than anything else, but at the same time it makes it almost impossible to try and catch the bar staff's eye to get served. There are more tables upstairs which are great for people-watching, but the stairs are really steep which isn't a great combination when you're trying to get down them in 5 inch heels to buy the next round!

Still worth a visit though.short review for a short visit!  the boyfriend and i stopped in here briefly while waiting to hear where to meet up with his friends later.  i did notice that the place seems to be have revamped since my last visit a few years ago and the bar area is definitely much better with booth seating along one side and proper high chairs at the bar.

we ordered two drinks, mine was an amaretto sour and the waitress brought them over to the table.  the amaretto sour was a perfectly nice drink and my boyfriend enjoyed his drink as well, but overall i'm not super excited about tgi fridays.  while i do crave that sort of american type food every now and then tgi fridays seems almost a little bit dated and under par compared to the rest of the edinburgh dining scene.  there are definitely worse places, but so many more places that are better for drinks or dinner!Seemed a withering pub for diehard locals.I originally gave this place 5 stars, but last time they sent out 2 people who didn't understand english to my table, but they were pretending as if they did understand me. I don't mind if their english is poor, but I'd prefer the honesty of their staff. My mango lasse was messed up because of the communication problem, even though I was told that they did understand what I wanted, as I had very specific questions about it. They also were late giving me my drink as it came after the main cource, and not even before or during the appetizer. Also, the samosas I got were black and crunchy in the middle, almost as if they were exposed to a freezer, then dry rotted, or the inside was burned somehow as the outside seemed fine. The second order of samosas came back o me frozen, so that's 2 times they messed that up. I do like the fact that their portions are decent, and the main courses were great, and I do remember really good experiences with this restaurant about a year prior to my bad experiences. I am giving them 3 stars because a long time ago they were great, but sems like they are going downhill a bit. I'm just being homest.The Southern had been on my "places to go and eat list" for a while now. So I mustered up the family for a wee cheeky dinner out. I had been craving burgers so I thought this place would be perfect. I only gave the place three stars cause the food didn't blow me away. It was A-OK. 

I ordered the onion rings, which I thought could be easily confused with some frozen rings. Not beautifully fried fresh onion rings, which make all the difference! The fries/chips were good, we got the stringy ones. Good stuff. The burger was A-OK. It did the job but I wasn't in love. The pickles on the burger were a bit of a disappointment (they were vinegary, not good ole bread n butter pickles).

The service left much to be desired as well. First the waitress forgot my drink. Then after taking our order she never came back! We got our order from another waitress and no one ever came back to ask us if we needed anything. We never saw our primary waitress again until I went to the bar to pay. I guess if you don't care about your tip then thats cool. I can dig it. 

Standard fare, standard service. Nothing spectacular: A-OK.I love this place, I really do so it pains me to say anything negative about it, but I must admit: the service is below par. They're just .. really, really slow. You can easily stand beside the counter for a couple of minutes waiting for a table, and then have someone pop over to you asking if they can help you with anything (in a slightly puzzled look). Well, since there's a sign asking me to wait to be seated, yes you can!

But the thing that really bothered me the last few times I was here was the lack of hygiene, spotty subject, I know. But when I find dust in my teacup, we've got an issue, and I don't just mean a cleaning issue. We've got a caring issue.
I love this place, but in order for it to be great, the staff must love it as well and take care of it as if it's their own.

Now, this might just have been the winter blues for the past 2 months but come on people, step up your game! I'm rooting for you here!I ended up taking a wee visit to Amicus Apple after having a leisurely stroll round the German Christmas Market. Main reason being my friend had seen the £5 cocktail menu outside - Hollaback Girl, I want one of those. Think that about covers her response, and I was not going to say no to a lovely wee cocktail after the eventful ferris wheel experience.

When we arrived I did feel a little under-dressed, I don't like walking in somewhere and immediately feeling like all the women there are judging me based on what I am wearing, I mean really, get over it. Yeah what I am wearing may not cost me an arm and a leg, and may not necessarily match to perfection, but all I want is a darned cocktail. 

Ignoring this we perched ourselves at the bar, then perused the cocktail menu. There is certainly enough choice here! But we ended up ordering a Hollaback Girl, which my friend quite enjoyed, and I had some Raspberry-ish lovely thing, the name escapes me. It was scrummy though, and disappeared very quickly! There were people around us having little plates of food, which smelled very tempting, and looked just as tasty!

Service was good, very friendly and not too bad on the eye either. My friend particularly liked one she nicknamed 'tasty', and I liked the one she accurately named 'hairy'.  All the things you would look for in a good barman, I would go back for that alone!Amicus Apple offers a lunchtime menu offering a range of dishes for £5. I chose the steak and ale stew, which proved to be really quite tasty. As a no-nonsense plate of sustenance, it was a winner. The place is quite smart, plays its music just a notch too loud, and is a good stop-off on an evening out. The cocktail menu is very decent, too.

Overall, we said: "though I have severe reservations about the term "gastrolunch", I was quite impressed with what the folks at Amicus Apple delivered. I like the notion of being able to pop in to somewhere like this, get a dish that's high on flavour and low on complications, to fuel you for the afternoon ahead. In that regard, it's much like the lunchtime offering at The Rosehip. I'd happily pop back, and would be entirely comfortable with suggesting that you do likewise."This is a solid bar. 

They have a good selection of beers and other stuff. The area downstairs can get a touch crowded but all in all is actualyl pretty comfortable and nice place to while away some time. 

Would recommend not sitting near the door in winter as it gets a touch breezy. 

It has started doing food. I had nachos. They were positive. I shall go back.I want to give this place more than just three stars because I actually had an incredibly lovely evening here last night.  However, the loveliness of my evening was due almost entirely to the company I was with, as well as the friendliness of the wait staff.  
The food was what really fell short here...and the chairs, the incredibly uncomfortable chairs.  
It was by no means bad, but it just didn't WORK very well. 

For starters I had- pumpkin gnocchi with shredded ham hock, slow roasted cherry tomatoes & bocconcini.  It was nice, and definitely my favorite dish of the evening.  The texture of the gnocchi was a bit unusual but ultimately the flavors of the dish went together nicely.  
Also, considering the size of the dish, it was a bargain at £5.95.  However, as it was a starter, I didn't want it to be that large.  It filled me up to the point I where I didn't need anything else to eat, and I hadn't even finished it!
My friend had the smoked halibut, baby spinach & goats cheese roulade with radish & watercress salad, roast yellow pepper & Arran mustard vinaigrette.  She asked if the yellow pepper could be left off, and they kindly replaced it with a reduced balsalmic (though, to be honest, I never noticed balsalmic anything).  We swapped starters so I had the chance to try this one as well.  The goats cheese roulade completely overwhelmed the halibut in both size and flavor.  The proportion of cheese to fish seemed to indicate that one was expected to take large mouthfuls of cheese with a tiny sliver of fish as an accompaniment.  I like cheese as much as the next person, but it was simply too much.  Even tiny accents of the cheese taken with the fish overwhelmed the flavor and ultimately I managed only a few bites before I gave up, uninterested.    

After our massive starters, even stretched out over about an hour and a half, we weren't hungry in the least.  Feeling too guilty to spend so much time at the table and have only wine and starters, we ordered a main to share.  We chose the braised Portobello mushrooms stuffed with black crowdie on a borlotti bean, white cabbage, plum tomato & basil stew, confit garlic coulis.  The mushrooms were nice, but the black crowdie had the texture of hard styrofoam and the beans were undercooked to the point of being hard.  The flavors and presentation were all quite nice but the individual elements were extremely lacking.  This dish was also immense and there is NO way I could have finished it alone.

We also noticed that all mains are served with a small side of steamed vegetables - new potatoes, carrots, broccoli and snow peas.  I'm not sure why they do this because while we all love veggies, they didn't compliment the dish (and it doesn't seem they would compiment anything on the menu), I certainly didn't need any more food, and really just think that the restaurant is wasting money on a completely unnecessary extra.  

The icing on the cake was when I was sitting in bed later that evening and my stomach was rumbling unhappily.  Not with hunger and certainly not as a result of over-eating, but clearly unimpressed by the sub-par meal.Student focused pub...
Beer garden for the summer...
Lots of drink specials.I love seafood, so it was always unlikely that I wasn't going to like this place (it's not the only thing they serve, but it's certainly takes up a fair chunk of the menu).

I have to say though, and this is why I'm not giving it 4 stars, it was way more expensive than it should have been. Monkfish wrapped in some form of pancetta or parma ham-esque meat isn't exactly hard to come across in restaurants at the minute, which does make you wonder why they can justify charging just under £19 for it.

Don't get me wrong, the food was nice and the service wasn't bad, but if I were paying the bill I'd have enjoyed it a lot less. Especially when Le Sept next door offers equally nice food for much better value for money.I really liked the vibe here but was disappointed with the food. It nicely decorated and the lighting is perfect, verging on dark which is quite relaxing for some reason. I had the pan fried halloumi salad but was not impressed. the cheese was cold and it shouldn't have been. maybe it had been sitting in the kitchen for a while before it came out, which is a shame because this place is fairly elegant and I reckon their other food is good. I'd go back as like I say, its a nice place to hang out. I sat and head the Hunger Games for over an hour and couldn't believe a whole hour had passed...The admission includes two drinks, which means that the price isn't all THAT unreasonable - 

Having been to other ice bars though (london and Hong Kong) I felt that this one fell short in comparison. The space wasn't that big and there just wasn't that much to see really..remember being slightly confused since the ice sculpture and some of the other decorations didn't really match, wasn't very cohesive overall. 

Ice bars, to me, are a little old. And this one certainly didn't wow me in any way. Go, if you've never been to one and enjoy the experience, but save yourself time and money if you've already been to another awesome ice bar.

OH. just a note, they don't allow you to take your camera inside...............HMClassic traditional old man pub, I really don't know what else to say apart from that.Stayed at the hotel for a conference and it's beautiful.  They've preserved some of its charm as a former castle - it has a beautiful dining room and lounge room, the outside grounds were beautiful.  But it's as if a Marriott hotel was the square peg - it just didn't fit, and I think much of the charm was lost...Almost every time I'm in Vegas, I come here. Their flautas are an appetizer big enough for a meal. That's all I ever really order and they are delicious. Unfortunately, I sat at the bar on a Sunday afternoon and the guy was quite inattentive. I had to ask for chips and salsa, refill on my water, and the check. Not the best service guys! But the waitress who was behind the bar really stepped it up.Half of my graduating class were self-proclaimed photographers, angstfully capturing the "essence that is life" with ridiculously expensive cameras, so you can't blame me for being a tad sceptical about photography.

I finally made it in to the gallery after walking past it quite a few times, and I wasn't disappointed at all. There's a pretty cool exhibition on show at the moment, which should last throughout the whole festival, called the Pursuit of Fidelity (very deep name ofcourse....). I won't say I'm a convert, but it was definitely a good way to pass time! What's even more interesting about Stills is the opportunity to get quite involved if this is your sort of thing; they have impressive darkrooms we were lucky enough to check out, and actually offer professional training for would-be photographers! I fleetingly considered it... as it would probably be a nice break from university for a while.So yes Starbuck more or less, for sure in large scale, introduced well done coffee to Edinburgh [surely more but hey no assumptions] but I have to say that their coffee isn't that great anymore, for the pure reason that there are so much better coffee to be found in Edinburgh's large amount of cafe's. One thing though, you won't find as creative coffees as 'pumpkin coffee' amongst their selection. They truly are the masters of cake coffee. 

Free wi-fi is always good, and location is great summer time being next to meadow. They do have rush hours with massive queues and lack of space for the demand but once you get your coffee and find a seat you'll never feel lonely here. 

To the guy next to me; this isn't a place to be mean to your girlfriend/friend - you made a fool of your self.Take a cardigan, this place is always cold! I really only go in summer, and even on a sunny day like today it was chilly. 

And yet, I still go, because the food's tasty and it's in a handy location for me. 

Metropole is lovely to look at - high ceilings, big windows, and booths round the edge to sit in. 

The food's delicious - I usually have a sandwich and chips, but there's always a couple of specials, and some delicious-sounding mains. And the staff are great and ... I feel bad for giving it three stars, but it's no fun eating with your coat on!Like Gavin, I got the impression Ragamuffin was left behind by the 1990s. I distinctly remember the stereotype portrayed in British comedies of feminist, Pagan improv poets doing small gigs in hippy bars wearing stuff like this. That's not meant to be offensive, but the tie dyed, long skirts and massive knitted jumpers take me back to that era.

I think most of the garments here are made in Skye, and their cosy functionality would be fitting of the brisk weather you often get up north. It looks durable and is locally sourced, and although I wouldn't wear stuff like this there is still a market for people who do. If you're looking for something that will keep you warm and last longer than most of the other flimsy high street offerings, you can't beat Ragamuffin's high quality knits. Some may mock their style but no one would turn down these jumpers when out camping or at a festival. They are the kind of garments you could huddle yourself in, a bit like swaddling clothing, to try and keep the bitter winds aff yer back.I have to say that I was quite disappointed after reading such stellar reviews on the site first.  If this is the best Sushi in Madison, then Madison is sorely lacking in good Sushi.  I've had much better in several cities across the country.

MISO SOUP - OK, but nothing special, and what's with the cheap metal western spoon?  When I order Miso soup in a Sushi restaurant, I want an Asian spoon to go with it.

POKE- very good!  This one thing alone kept me from dropping this restaurant down to two stars.  If you go here get the Poke (big eye tuna, sesame seaweed, yuzu-miso).

DUCK ROLL - uneventful.  Nothing wrong with it, but nothing that would make me order it again.

VIPER ROLL  - this one was good.  Not spectacular, but the best one of the three that were ordered tonight.

SOFT SHELL CRAB - not good at all.,  The crab tasted like it was a bit old - not fresh.

GENERAL SUSHI COMMENT - they need to wrap the sushi tighter.  The rolls fall apart way too easily while you're trying to pick them up.  There also just seems to be a general bland flavor to their sushi rolls -nothing exciting whatsoever.

SERVICE: no issues with service except that we did have to ask for drink refills instead of them being automatic.  No big deal here because they were easy to flag down, but you shouldn't have to flag them down at all.

OVERALL, I am not inclined to return as I know where to get much better sushi in other cities that I frequent.  If this is the best that Madison has, then, well, I'm sorry.BBQ is BBQ- This is a chain and that is what you get. It is always good and never have to wait for a seat. Great place to go with  family and the servers are all awesome!I went to Frankie's on my birthday. Their drinks are no joke. Lightweights, beware! Reasonable prices for drinks. I will probably check it out again since I did go there on a first friday and it was pretty packed...We went on the opening weekend.  Atmosphere is nice.  It is nice to have a place like this in downtown Chandler.  It looks like this will become a spot to visit frequently.  Food was good.  Service was a bit slow.  Hopefully, they were just working out all the kinks.Came here for a Saturday dinner, the place was pretty big and pretty busy. Contemporary decor and very nice staff! Here's a bit of recap of what we had:

~Chips & Salsa - 3 stars - decent and limitless!
~Crab & Shrimp Ceviche - 5 stars! I absolutely loved this! Very refreshing!!
~Grilled Fish Taco - 3 stars - nice presentation and good.
~Beef 'House Specialty' Enchilada - 1 star... the meat was way too salty, and I guess it was so special that just don't expect this to be your normal enchilada from anywhere...quite disappointed on this house special
~Tres Leche Cake - 3.5 stars - it was decent with some whipped cream and strawberries on top, but the cake wasn't so soaked and the cinnamon taste was too strong....

I'd visit again just for some chips and ceviche!!What a nice day, today! 
I had a business associate in from San Francisco ( I always laugh when I write that because it makes me sound like Tony Soprano..."business associate", but we aren't in "waste management" so I guess we're OK).
We went to lunch at the Daily Dose, when he replied "burger" to my query "Mexican or Burger?"
The DD is OK. Just that...OK.
Daily Dose the little brother of Fusion and in something close to the standard definition of insanity, I always get a DD burger there and expect it to be as good as the burger at Fusion...it never is, and yet, I try it again! It's the old software dog in me...I am well aware that I can run the exact same program 10 times and the 11th time it will perform differently (often better!!!).
The service was good today, the weather was terrific, and the food was OK, not great but certainly not bad (the alternative would have been a burger at Fudd's, and I always try to support my local folks, if I can).
So, go on a nice day, sit outside and watch the world go by, and don't be like me...order something other than DD burger, and together, we can break this cycle of mine!I don't really care for this buffet.  There isn't really anything special about it.  The service is slow and the food is cold and never looks fresh.  It does seem to be one of the cleaner "local" buffets.  I can't complain about the price either, definitely worth getting the player's card.  Everytime you use your card, they give you a little survey and you get money off your next visit.Great Health Food option after gorging yourself on the excess of Las Vegas. 

Located right outside the gym/spa in the Palazzo this restaurant offers healthy spins on breakfast options so you don't need to feel guilty in the city of sin!

I ordered the Sonoran Scramble (Scrambled Eggs with tomato, corn, chili chorizo, onion, garlic, avocado, cilantro, tortilla strips and cheddar. 

The portion was very controlled but super filling and kept me running through the beginning of my day. 

One disappointment was when we ordered the Pomgranate juice - we expected everything to be "fresh" and they brought out glasses with ice and a store purchased bottle of juice. This took a little of the "fresh" angle from our view...but overall a great healthy option.Had breakfast this morning while waiting on getting my windows on my car tinted. I had the build your own omelete. I got it with chorizo bell peppers and cheddar cheese. It was pretty good and the portion size was big for the price. They had fresh squeezed orange juice too. Not the best breakfast I've had but it was good.I'm not a huge club person but I can definitely appreciate a fine venue when I go to one.  The club is so damn big it is really hard to put into words.  Lol, I've seriously been in smaller towns and cities!  

Well as expected, the line was freaking long... at least an hour or so... Thankfully, we knew someone so we were able to walk right up!  As expected, the place was packed and the music jamming.  We made our rounds inside and eventually made our way to the outside pool area.  The lines for drinks didn't seem too long but I had to wait almost 45 minutes!!!  

In general, the place was fun but didn't really excite me more than all of the other clubs.  I'm sure we'll be back until something new and trendy opens up.The guy and I stopped by Botero for lunch last Saturday. Since it was lunch time, we got to sit outside, near the Encore pool. 

The covered patio is nice: I liked being able to eat outdoors in Las Vegas without sweating my buns off. 

The guy ordered the Kobe burger, which I thought was absolutely delicious. My turkey panini, on the other hand, was lacking in flavor and in texture. The bread was a bit to chewy and dry, so it was hard to swallow without gagging a little bit. I think the sandwich could have used the help of some cheese or something saucier than their aioli. 

Maybe their dinner is better than their lunch, but I don't think I would go out of my way to come back to Botero... okay, maybe for their burger.The thing with Vegas is if you are feeling lazy and not wanting to venture outside the little town known as your Hotel, you're kinda stuck with the dining options in the hotel.  Enter Society.

There was a 15-20 minute wait for 2 people on a Saturday morning.  That's expected.  I figured the food would be jaw dropping or at least saliva inducing.  How I came to this conclusion was the lovely decor, but don't judge a book by its cover.

Food was just okay.  I had the egg white and goat cheese fritatta.  I imagined a nice juicy fritatta with goat cheese interspersed throughout.  NOPE!! There was just a little dollop of whipped goat cheese sitting a top of my fritatta.  Coffee was delicious, but it's kinda hard to screw up coffee.To be honest I was disappointed with TPC the course was not in great shape and the layout was ok I might might have set my sights a little high before I got there. If you want to play here because you want to say you played the TPC then fine but there are other courses around that are better and for much better deal. I don't see myself going back.Perfect for people watching, not crowded. Fondue tree is beautiful, but somewhat disappointing as we were expecting a traditional fondue service - the fondue is served as a trio of chocolate dipping sauces. Convenient location right next to the front desk.C Bar at the Stratosphere. I know.. "Why would you be at the Stratosphere?" Well, the Friday night event for Birthdaycon was at C Bar this year, and I gotta tell ya - it's not that bad! It's the semi-standard circular "center" bar setup you'll find around Vegas (even though it doesn't seem to be in the center of anything). Booth seating around the outer circumference, video poker bar around the inner and tables with comfortable-enough chairs in the middle. Drinks were standard casino fare...$5-10 each. The waitress was nice enough. Bartenders were a little douche-y. But seriously, it really wasn't that bad!! I don't know about you, but when I heard "bar at the Stratosphere" I cringed.  It seems I may have over-reacted a little. There are definitely worse places on the Strip to sit and drink. C Bar wasn't really packed on a Friday CES night, and it's even pretty close to the so-so valet. I don't know why I'd ever go back here, but if I had to, I wouldn't be that upset about it!I really can't complain since we got an excellent bargain off of hotwire ($31/night), but if I had to pay the original prices based off of the hotels website, I think my review would be much more critical. The hotel lobby and casino are nicely kept, a bit smokey but what Las Vegas hotel isn't. The room size itself was adequate and the bed was comfy.  Very simple, no coffeemaker or refrigerator in the room.  The walls needed a bit of repair, some faded wall spots were very apparent and our bathroom door would not close.  Called maintanence but they did not show up the whole weekend we were there to fix it.  I would rate this hotel a 3/5 and would say it's more of a 3 star than 4 star.  Would stay again if I receieved the same deal.  I would also ask to stay in the Paradise Tower because it's closer to main entrance.  The Club Tower is quite a walk. Lastly, this hotel is one of the south end hotels and adjacent from the MGM.  It is a bit far from the middle of Las Vegas BLVD where all the action is.At $.39 an ounce this is another pay as you go self serve yogurt shop to hit the valley. They have the usual suspects, tart, vanilla and also several different "skinny" versions which are "no sugar, which means they don't add any but does contain sugar, so beware. On my visit they were out of 'skinny blueberry.. rats!

Had a cup of the skinny yogurt.. again the cups are huge much like Yogurtology so you can over indulged quite easily. I was ready this time and only took just a little bit. The topping bar look great though nothing to really set it apart from the other place with the exception of the fruit looking and tasting fresher. 

While there is no "skinny" tart version, the vanilla was decent enough with only a slight weird chemical after taste.Very stylish restaurant and bar. I prefer to have drinks here or lunch, dinner can be a little disappointing. Overall a good place to drink but would suggest eating elsewhere.I was happy when I came across this little spot not too far from my gate. I ordered a killer breakfast sandwich... when I say killer I mean it. This thing was HUGE. It was on a pretzel bun which was tasty but there was honestly about 8 eggs worth of egg... I mean I guess that is good value. Who complains about too much food right? Well I had to toss a bunch of egg in order to fit this bad boy in my mouth but it was delicious.Campy, old-timey saloon. Just as cheesy as you'd imagine, but isn't that the point? Live band on Thursday nights (sang Ghost Riders in the Sky with bullwhip, natch). Bring your favorite senior citizen.Food was good. Flavorful sauces, spices, and rice. Staff is arrogant. For example, we have been to the restaurant a couple times so they know us, last time I had a cast on leg, my friend and I were the only ones in there, we asked if he would bring the food tray over to us, he would not. That was both rude and odd. I guess its a cultural thing.This place is cheap and I was able to find enough food to satisfy myself but there's some weirdness to it as well. For example, the server set a tray full of dirty dishes on my table while I was eating, walked away, and left it there for about 5 minutes. I don't want to eat while looking at dirty dishes and chewed up watermelon rinds. 

The custom omelette station made me add a star. Very delicious omelettes are made to order and served piping hot. I don't know if this is available for Sunday brunch only so be sure to check. 

This place is conveniently located in the Gold Coast casino.Scramble has a really cute layout and color scheme like all the other breakfast joints: 
Very clean and hip
I had the impression that it was a sit down restaurant but it's an order and seat yourself sort of deal... It got a little bit packed and was kinda hard to find a seat but we managed to find one... 
I got a coffee, the breakfast blend...
And the Costa breakfast burrito which came with potatoes
The burrito itself was really good and flavorful
I didn't like the potatoes, so I just let them sit there 
The service was a little slow but not a big deal at all, I'm very patient and I saw how busy it was
All of the girls working were very friendly and cute
It was a good first experience and maybe next time I will try the breakfast pizzaThe girlfriend and I chose to stay and play at Aria Resort & Casino on our recent trip to Vegas.  We had been to Aria on a previous Vegas trip to eat at Sage and do a little gambling, but had not stayed there.  Our flight got into Vegas at 11pm on a Sunday night, so we didn't get to Aria until after midnight.  At least 6 stations at the check-in counter were manned and line to check-in was over twenty deep with guests waiting to get into their rooms.  Despite a little wait, check-in went smoothly and we got into our room by 1am.  

Hands down, Aria has the most high-tech rooms that I've stayed in Vegas.  Upon opening the door, the room lights came on and the curtains over the floor to ceiling windows opened.  Most, if not all, essential room functions to include turning on/off lights, opening/closing the curtains, setting a wake-up alarm, and controlling the HD flat panel were controlled by a master control next to the bed.  Speaking of which, the bed and linens were among the most comfortable I've experienced in any hotel affording a very good night's sleep...what little sleep I got while in Vegas.  

The one glaring negative about our stay at Aria was the gaming.  I play blackjack and craps; however, I wasn't feeling very excited about the blackjack and crap options at Aria.  Throughout our entire stay, the table minimums for blackjack and craps remained at $50 and $15, respectively.  Really?  Even mid-week, mid-day?  I'd hate to see what the minimums are on the weekend!  Aria did have some $25 blackjack tables, but they used the continuous shuffle machines rather than a multi-deck shoe.  I don't play that way.  Aria had the highest table minimums of any of the casinos we visited on the Strip to include the Bellagio, Venetian, Palazzo, and the Cosmopolitan.  No wonder the tables were always empty! 

So, upon final review, Aria Resort & Casino is a fine place to stay especially if you can get a discounted room rate, and a good place to dine, but for your recreational, regular joe gambler, play somewhere else.First impressions..Looks:massive and stylish ...service: 4004 rooms and 7 check-in attendants waiting in line like a Disney e ticket back in the old days some of the glitter removed...I now understand why Vegas went to the more Family way of Fun because slots are not any Fun Anymore.

Money in paper voucher out..There was nothing like the sound of alarms and Sirens going off when someone won $50 in penny's, Nickles, Quarters or whatever, the sounds made Vegas, now it is little more than a Dumb Game to throw money away.

Like me putting $40 dollars into my X-Box and 20 mins later money is gone and fun was done.

Not a big fan of Vegas as gambling will check out the sights next time.

If you are hooked on gambling it won't matter to you, for me it WAS entertainment.

The Housekeeping staff here is the friendliest and most professional and consistently so,

The room was nice but the Computer Controlled items through the TV was torturous and clunky, too many buttons to push to do what needed to be done, I guess if  I were living there for a month or 2 I would get used to is but....

Front Desk staff has the warmth and personality of robotic Clones....No Warm Smile, they look like they despise their jobs although there was one young lady (Heavy set) at the head of the check in line who stood out, She smiled personally directed you to the front desk attendants, pleasant and tried to make pleasantries as you waited. The young lady with the accent not so much.

The view was nice from our Room.Yes, I am rating this lower than Imperial Palace. A few gripes:

1) It is impossible to figure out how to get to this hotel by car. There is only one ramp entrance, and it so well-hidden it would win in hide-and-seek.

2) We paid for the Vdara Suite, but due to the high occupancy on Memorial Day Weekend, we were downgraded to a tiny room WITHOUT being told so!!! Imagine downgrading from a suite that is supposed to have two rooms, a full-sized fridge, and TWICE the square footage of the tiny single room you're "mistakenly" assigned to. Thankfully, some angry ranting fixed the problem for the following night, which included an upgrade to the Executive Suite, $100 in room service credit, and complimentary champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries.

3) Free wifi is unreliable on the iPhone.

4) The shower walls are transparent, so if you're taking a dump, you'll get a show. And vice versa, except not so pleasant for the person showering.

But I guess it has some perks:

1) It is ridiculously close to Marquee Dayclub and Nightclub at the Cosmopolitan, so you don't have to taxi back. Just make sure you're sober enough to take advantage of the short distance.

2) Parking is mandatory valet, which is convenient.

3) It doesn't have a casino since it's the sister of Aria, so it's slightly cheaper.

4) The interior is beautiful, hip, and modern.

5) The downstairs cafe has bomb iced coffee, apparently.

I'm still miffed about the room mixup though. Not cool.Oh, Vdara. I wish I could like you more, but you're not as wonderful as you look on the outside.

Check-in was at 3 p.m., but since me and my friends arrived around 11 a.m., we wanted to see if they could check us in early. The front desk said they'd have the room ready in the next two hours. 1 p.m. arrived and there was no phone call about being able to check-in yet. It was almost 3 p.m. and by then, we went back to the front desk and they said it was still not ready. What?! At first, they said it would take another half hour or so before we'd be able to go up and I'm not sure what happened, but after a couple of minutes, they said it was ready and we were on our way up.

Although we got a nice, panoramic view of Vegas, we were a bit disappointed to find trash still underneath the sink, sticky table tops, traces of dry vomit on the sheets, and empty bottles left in the refrigerator. While they were very professional about taking care of the situation, it was still frustrating having to call the manager and explain the situation when all this could have been avoided if it was cleaned properly the first time.

Not sure if I'd consider checking-in here again, but the hotel did do its job for the weekend. I'm just glad to be back home now - sans vomit-stained bed.We saw this place on Restaurant Stakeout, so when a Groupon came up we bought one. Overall for the price I think we would go somewhere on the strip instead. It was odd to me that they had everyone crammed in one section of the restaurant instead of opening the other side. The salads we had were fresh and good nd I also liked that we could get a half order of any salad. I had the crab cakes for an appetizer. They were okay, pretty salty though. We both had the rib eye Oscar style. It was okay, not the best steak and I didn't realize their Oscar style wasn't with lump crab meat but instead another crab cake...so I was way over the crab cakes by then!
Overall it was good but again for the price (without a groupon) I know there are much better restaurants in this town.Driving through the sweltering heat I occasionally see a set of billboards for the M Resort stating "BEST---RATED---BUFFET---IN VEGAS". One could not help but contain themselves after trekking so far off the strip.
 We got there around just around 1pm, just barely beating the lunch rush. Despite that. our wait in line was still 45 minutes, and a that point I didn't know if I was hungry any more (pretty sure it was the result of standing next a guy who's B.O. nearly caved me and my friends in).
We finally get our table and was waited on by one of the cheeriest fellows I've ever met, if you've met him make sure to tip well. I grab a couple plates and check out there "foods of the word" themed lay out and honestly not to much looked enticing. Non the less I grab a little of everything and come to like the "southern" portion of the buffet. I loved  there fried mushrooms, uber-sweet mashed yams and the fat hunks of ribs they had on display. I swelled in content as I able get my guilty pleasure off their fast-food style "Asian" section, chow-mein I have missed you. Their dessert section was a bit lackluster save for the Gelato portion, Pistachio is a must try. 
Side note: be aware of their Rum Raisin, it literally taste like there's a shot of rum it! Not something you want to be reminded of after a night of partying, but if you want to get a cheap buzz then by all means get gelato-wasted!
Overall the buffet is so-so, the price was right (lunch $15.99) so I''m not complaining. I guess the let down came from all the hype from the banners I saw along the way to Vegas and I guess I missed their popular Seafood Section, a result of coming on a Friday.  In the end it's too much of a drive if your staying on the strip.Service was ok, the cashiers and the beer lady were the best... The food was ok, large selection which was nice however i think they should spend more time making each item taste better then having hundreds of items. The food was.... free beer awesome... we watied an hour to get in. was not to bad we kept saying we were going to try it for the last 3 months. was ok... maybe just a bad day...We have been here a few times and I have not yet been that impressed! Friends continue to tell me how great this place is? I don't get it!!! Pizza is pretty much plain. Nothing special about sauce, dough, or anything! Maybe we should dine in and see how it is right out of the oven? I'll let you know how that goes? In the mean time, place is just OK!Several of our friends had advised us the food was great, so we decided to check it out for ourselves. We had friends over and especially one from France for a special occasion.

Location - Where is the signage at?  Took us a bit to find it as there is very little signage for this restaurant at the M Resort, but we did eventually stumble upon it.

Reservations - Very nice, accommodating and easy to make changes. 
My party changed from 6 to 7 and they had no issues, especially as it was a holiday weekend and a Saturday as well (Thanksgiving.

Bar Service - Very attentive and relaxing. I enjoyed it.

Food Service - Not bad, but not great either. Wine knowledge seems a bit mundane, especially if you are a novice like me, but at the end, the waiter did finally suggest a nice wine and a reasonable price and it was very enjoyable.  

Menu -  Bread selection is fine, but a bit sparse in quantity. I think that this should be fine though , as you do not want to load up on this stuff.  They also serve some antipasto at the table as a courtesy with the bread and that is good, especially the Gran Padano cheese, which is a hard Parmesan type of cheese in larger chunks. This is great tasting.  Overall selection of food on the menu was extensive.

Menu Quality - Whenever I am at an Italian restaurant, I test it by the quality of the Osso Buco which is a veal shank and with bone marrow.  I finished about 30% of it, as it was okay, but a bit overcooked. The risotto it was on was great, but oddly, they do not provide you with the small spoon to scoop out the bone marrow from the shank, which is an essential part of the meal as far as I am concerned.  The Chop salad was great.

Dessert - Surprisingly good, but very small in quantity.  Perhaps exactly what we all need, especially after the Thanksgiving weekend.  Just don't expect large portions. 

I will go back for sure as the ambiance is quite nice.  The food is fine and I would like to try it again as so many friends have raved about this place, and maybe I was just a bit off that night.......This restaurant has a casual yet sophisticated vibe to it. If you are lucky enough to get a seat near the windows you will have an amazing view of the Edinburgh castle. 

Hubby and I went for an early dinner and were able to take advantage of a special for Duck confit with squash puree as well as a prawn and salmon salad. We also ordered a side of garlic fries which were really yummy. I found the rest of the menu a bit limited and would have probably rather tried the lunch offerings but we missed the service time for that.

Tip: if the pudding menu doesn't tickle your fancy head down the road to the Vittoria* Gelato/Ice cream window
*Thanks to Jenny L. for the reminder on name of the place =)Pretty big menu, and overall pretty decent breakfast...nothing crazy good here though, everything I have had is just ok. Egg works got them beat for sure! Or if you want some real solid breakfast go to the coffee cup!I recently went to the Buffet again for Breakfast and haha my inlaws got us the buffet breakfast here for can you believe it $2.99 because they used points and got it half off. Now for even the regular price it was a good deal for the items you get. Granted it isn't the full line up like lunch or dinner but freshly carved Turkey and Ham and Omelets made to order just those two things make it worthwhile. Then you can get your Bacon, Waffles, chicken, fruits and many other things to make you happy. I think I love Vegas more for the Cheap Food than anything else (cause I never win big)I've been the one in New York and it is a lot better.  The menu here is different than the one in New York, they don't have the shepards pie....., but anyway people only go for the frozen hot chocolate.  The food here was good, the service was bad.

Our waitress was a compete idiot, she was rude, and the food took a long time to come to our table.I only came here for the frozen hot chocolate...just to see what it was about.  Honestly, it was quite disappointing.  I was hoping for a stronger chocolate flavor.  I was okay with it mainly because I was sitting outside on the patio in the scorching heat.  The service was great, but I won't be coming back here.Its an expensive burger/pasta place. Probably wont go there again. The food we ordered was good but just way to expensive for my taste. I only got a salad and soup and it was WAY over priced. Its a good date place if you are trying to impress but not really a place you would visit regularly.Was planning to go to the location in New York later this year when I visit but given it happened to be here in Vegas; we gave it a try. Frozen hot chocolate was good but  definitely overrated at $10 a pop.  However, for brunch, my boyfriend had some dish with gravy and biscuits on it and those were definitely the best biscuits I had.Wow, this place was way overrated. I'd heard so many good things about SERENDIPITY that it almost became impossible to keep up with the hype. I was in LV for work for over a week, and hit up Serendipity after several folks recommended it.

We waited about 30 minutes on a Friday night, which isn't that bad. We got a seat on the patio, facing the strip. I had the Meatball Pizza on the waiters recommendation, and quite frankly - I didn't like it. The ricotta was overpowering and made it hella soggy. He noticed I didn't really go in for the kill and asked if I liked it. I told him not really, and when the bill arrived, he scratched it from the total. I thought that was cool.

I also tried their famous Frozen Hot Chocolate. While it was certainly delish, I thought it was just a milkshake with more ice? 

I'd definitely go back, but this place is basically Fenton's.

3.5 starsI was a little disappointed in the frrrozen hot chocolates...definitely overpriced. $11 for a regular sized cup? Not worth it in my opinion.

I ordered a strawberry one, expecting it to be strawberry chocolate, but it basically turned out to be a creamy strawberry smoothie. What a misleading name....only the original frrrozen hot chocolate is actually really good. 

Their pizza was good though! We got the BBQ chicken. Quite filling and it had a lot of toppings!I remembered Famous Dave's as being better than it was here. Although the service was very good, the food left me hanging. The burnt brisket tub sandwich was super tough and chewy and my side of Mac and cheese was bland and tasteless. Hubby's ribs were tough and disappointing. The only thing that they seemed to get fit were the fries. Which isn't reason enough for me to return.Pretty good but not the best.  Our server tried hard to be helpful but they appeared to be understaffed.  The "manager" came by and apologized without our complaining, it was a bit odd.Not exactly what I expected- small dining room, very un-pretentious, odd mix of turkish and italian. Somehow it works though. I had to stop myself from licking the plate my baked eggplant came on, and I swear my husband finished his whole plate of baked ziti in under 5 minutes. The service was quick and friendly. I'd come back here but probably more for a week night I don't want to cook and not for a special night out.Kind of boring I wish there more Qdobas in VegasVery friendly service and above average food. Not a bad spot for downtown Fremont Street.This place was dead compared to Bellagio last night.

It has a lot of the basic shops, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Dior, Tiffany, along with some others that Bellagio does not have, like Harry Winston (drools) and kiki de montparnasse... which is a fun, lingerie shop that you don't want your children, or those faint of heart.... going into. 

In the back, they have a bed with a model in it.... they have pillows with pillow covers... that tell what kind of mood you are in... the "sleep" mood, or the "F^ck" mood. No joke. It also has a camcorder set up "to film the fun", with $250 whips. I had fun in there.

The girl working at kiki de montparnasse had a sweet and charming personality.....Unlike the staff at the bellagio. 

The thing that separates the two casinos is Bellagio has more artsy things, while Crystals has the better shops, and it seems the better personalities. If I'm going to spend that kind of money, I'll at least be treated like a decent human being.

The bellagio has all the flowers,
Crystals has big ice towers, cyclones of water, and a little turtle statue in front of Dolce and Gabbana.I thought The Parlor was okay. From the outside, you can't really tell what kind of place you're going into. I liked that. They also have an herb garden outside. 

My co-worker and I split the small caesar salad, glad the dressing wasn't overly fishy. I went basic, and ordered the pepperoni & basil pizza. It was good, and the mozzarella was homemade. My co-worker ordered the fungi pizza and raved about it.A hidden gem in the heart of Phoenix. I pass The Parlor almost daily and never realized it was there. Glad we found it. Great city-urban atmosphere. Pizza was good (3 outta 5) but the environment saved it. Fab bar and drinks. Take friends and relax. Fun, nice city eating.I've had several meals here and just wanted to post a comment after my most recent visit this week.  The steak itself is okay, but I would agree with other posters that are better options nearby.  My gripe involves the soda policy and the mashed potatoes.

They charge $4.50 per soda, and push refills agressively without telling you it is not free refills.  Even after finishing my entire meal, the waitress asked again and luckily I said no.  My advice is order a coke, but ask for just two ice cubes, they fill a glass with ice and you get almost no soda.

The mashed potatoes taste fine, but they are runny and should not be if they are to be good mashed potatoes.ARIA please DO NOT Advertise King Crab Legs on Taxis and Magazines if you are not going to carry it anymore!!!

Some things actually improved this visit and some things were a total disappointment. 

Cons
-They only offered snow crab legs - which were fine, but I was anticipating Alaskan. 
-Long lines (like any buffet). Thank God I had a line pass. 

Pros
-Hash brown balls were actually pretty good (when they brought out a fresh batch)
-Just realized they offered Truffle Oil w/ their Omelet. Delicious!
-Cookies were good. I only tried the Macadamia & White Chocolate. 
-$23.99The selection here is solid. Not too much variety compared to the other ones. However, this place has one thing that I love to eat..... King Crab legs. I swore that was all I ate here. The tri tip was pretty good as well. However, asides from those two selection, everything else is pretty mediocre. If you want King Crab legs come here, if not then I recommend somewhere else.Well, I've tried to eat lunch here several times since my last review, but they've been closed every time.

DarenC and I tried to meet once, and he found out they only open for dinner most days, with Saturday being the only real lunchtime hours available.

This, despite the fact that the nearby shopping center entrances are graced with half a dozen peices of large, colourful signage advertising their lunch specials!

The food was good, but I can't get at it.Cute little space in Scottsdale101, with nice staff. Red Mango may be the original tart yogurt place (as they claim), but they've been far outdone by newcomers. Their new tangomonium flavor and the pomegranate flavor are both good, but personally, I find their yogurt too creamy for tart flavors. I prefer the slightly more icy Pinkberry yogurt (Ice Tango, here in AZ, is more similar to Pinkberry). But the ultimate fro-yo place, IMO, is Yogurtland, and they spank Red Mango silly on variety and cost. For about $10 at Red Mango, you get two smalls with two toppings each. For roughly the same price at Yogurtland, you can get two huge cups with as many flavors and toppings as you'd like (it's done by weight). Red Mango may be the first but Yogurtland is the champ!Madcap is ok. Yes, it is cool to have a theatre where you can see old cult classics and new b-movies, and I'm really glad it's available, but the place is just ok.
   I have only been in one of the theatres so far, and it is clean and all but the chairs were beat up. The cushions sank pretty far down and the chairs squeeked and groaned everytime someone moved around. And in my experience so far the staff has seemed less than excited that I was there. I have had no problem with movie quality or sound which is most important to me.
   Look, I will come back to Madcap, and I encourage everyone to check listings and see what movies are coming up there, I hope it does well, but it just isn't a nice place.Quirky drink and food names. Cool vibes at First Food & Bar.

The drinks at this place are amazing. I was with all of my colleagues and ended up somehow with a Margarita the size of my head. Neat drink names like "Tigers Blood" and Candy Kiss something or other....all looked and sounded amazing. Lots of beer on tap to choose from, very cool looking atmosphere. The staff was very accomodating and attentive to our large group and overall we had a great time!

Only thing really lacking was the flavor of food. Dorritos Mac N Cheese was flavorless....could have done better with Kraft. The chopped wedge salad was OK, but the only flavor seemed to be coming from the large chunks of blue cheese. Even the chicken on it wasn't seasoned very well. The tots were good...but who can go wrong with those. The pretzels with homemade mustard was great. Cheesesteak won tons/potstickers with siracha ketchup were very tasty. Certainly not all worth the price however. Perhaps would have been better off ordering main meals but still was not impressed.My wife wanted to go to downtown Glendale because it had cute shops and such.

It got more exciting when she mentioned Mexican food.  This place is what I expected from the reviews.  The food was traditionally made and the tomale was real fresh and delish.  The Salsa was really really stand-out good which improved the quality of all the items.  

Unlike other reviews, we had really really attentive service including fast seating, waters filled, asked if we were ready to order when we looked up from menus, etc... 

This place was a standard, good, sit-down mexican tucked in a cozy little historic downtown.  No complaints.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend the place solely on the food or atmosphere, but it was a nice spot overall.Was going to get something, but I went during lunch time on a Saturday afternoon.  Decided to go somewhere else and buy it.  Huge parking lot, but not a safe neighborhood.  Before you buy anything you are going to consume, make sure you check for mold and expiration dates.  I only go for non-food items.Being an IHG platinum level member means I've stayed at a variety of properties. This would be my first at a villa. It was not at the caliber I expected. First off, it was disappointing to be set-up at the one compound with the pool under renovation. The slippers that were provided were not one size fits all. The air conditioning did not circulate well and we had a gas issue with our oven.

I did not find it impressive for the purposes of trying to convince me to join Club vacations. Service wise the staff was outstanding, especially the shuttle drivers picking folks up around the property or taking folks to the strip. The bell hops were exceptional as well.

I did enjoy being away from the strip and having a sense of retreat from all the action, but the price would determine if I would return because I expected more from a villa experience.Their meat is good and nicely marinated just wish they had more variety of panchan.  It's decent for Vegas... I guess.  *dreaming about k-town....There are a few things on the menu at BWR that pop out, which is why I decided that I needed to go here. On the top of the list of menu stand outs are the buffalo chicken nachos. Just thinking about the potential in that title makes me want them. They are exactly what one would expect that they are - nachos blanketed with cheese and the regular nacho supreme goodness, topped off with a generous helping of diced chicken tenders and buffalo sauce. It's a wonderfully sinful idea, but I felt like it could have been a bit better. I also got to try the gyro quesadilla. Again, this is one crazy sounding concoction that just seemed to fall a little bit short for me. Think of a cheese quesadilla with gyro meat in it served with a side of tzatziki, and there you have it. I will say that their beer selection is pretty fantastic. If I do ever go back here, it'll probably be for a happy hour.Revisited Macayo's for a family birthday -- based on my past experiences and subsequent one-star review, I was wincing at what we might get.

The food is still blah. As I mentioned in my previous review, it's cafeteria-like and nothing worth writing about (ah, the irony). It was properly temp'ed, so there is that.

However, we seemed to hit a bit of a jackpot, server-wise, which can make up quite a bit of ground. Our server was a very nice person -- very attentive, nice to the kids, and hooked the birthday-person up with the free sweets and singing. I did see the manager wandering around and then sitting at a booth chatting with someone -- she did not acknowledge us even though I made eye contact with her a couple times as she walked by. I've always sorta liked the whole wandering manager asking if everything is okay bit, even if it's a gimmick.

A solid three stars this time.The Hotel du Vin is such a cooooooooool place.  The setting is gorgeous, they have a really swish smoking shelter with a fire which makes me want to take up smoking (joking!), an amazingly fabulous whisky snug, and a cool wine glass chandelier.  

I booked in here for afternoon tea with my mom, attracted by the interesting G&T(ea) option.  We actually decided on the bubbly accompaniment, but the cocktail did sound tasty.  

We arrived to a lovely little setup.  There were two parties who had booked in for afternoon tea and we each got our own little tucked away corner to enjoy ourselves.  This was great because it allowed us to chat and stay for ages.  

The downside started when we waited quite a while for the very rushed/harassed bartender (on a Monday afternoon) to come and ask how we would like to receive our tea (we asked for the bubbly last, but got it first).  We then waited for what felt like too long again before actually receiving our tea and nibbles.  

The nibbles were... meh.  The sandwiches were fine though pretty uninspired.  Ham, cheese, and salmon.  That's it.  We then each had two scones (one fruit and one plain).  I never understand when they give you two full-sized scones and often wonder if it's a cheap way to fill someone up?  The dessert tier was pretty lacking.  I tried everything and while half of the desserts didn't seem terribly fresh, the other half were just relatively tasteless.  

So, the setting was fantastic but the actual afternoon tea itself left me feeling pretty "meh" about the whole experience.  

I would come here for a drink but would look elsewhere next time I feel like afternoon tea,You know....This palce is pretty nice and the food is great, but I wasnt very full after ordering my meal and sharing an appetizer. I would say three stars for the cost to food. I mean, yes the food is good but if it doesnt fill me up and you charge so much, FORGET IT. Its a neat place but I wouldnt recommend it.So if you're looking for a decent vegas buffet with an ok price and without long lines you found it here.  But there's a reason for that. They don't have much selections and often are inconsistent with the quality.

Example, the last time I was there, my first serving of brisket was excellent, juicy, tender, could cut with a fork but it was only enough to just get started.  I knew I wanted more brisket so when it was time for my 2nd serving of brisket I asked for 2 big pieces. Big mistake because they were both extremely dry and salty, and these were not end cuts. I couldn't even make them better by dunking them into bbq sauce or au jus.

Soups and salads are ok, you cant really mess that up. Desserts are also ok.  Avoid most of the food on the left side of the buffet, it's the sides and misc stuff, they don't always look fresh.  The sandwiches are ok though.  

Like most buffets they have a different theme each night, though most of the selections are the same every night.  Turkey, brisket, and roast beef seems to be there every night.  I didn't care for their Monday Italian night nothing Italian stood out differently. Friday Pacific Rim and Sunday Prime Rib and Shrimp nights are the only nights with enough difference to notice are a little better.

The food are still good and worth eating since your not paying an arm or leg for, around $10. The service is usually good and usually a quiet place to eat, minus the slot machine sounds you might hear.I come to this park every Tuesday because my usual park is closed and for the most part people are very friendly and dogs are as well but all heck breaks loose when the old man with the 2 dogs that aren't friendly gets there.... He believes that since he has been coming there for 9 years that he OWNS it and treats people with such dissrespect as well as their dogs.... This past Tuesday my dog was playing with his (my dogs) ball when another dog took it (no problem there because my dog will just follow the other dog around until it gets dropped and he can retreive it) the dog finally dropped it at the mans feet so he promptly picked up the ball when this man grabbed my dog by the ear and started twisting it to get the ball from him; my dog yelped and I asked him to "NOT touch my dog like that!"... The man then proceeded to pull at my dog until he put both of his hands in my dogs mouth and told me that "if my dog bit him he would sue me".... I don't take kindly to people harming animals especially when they are mine.... My dog let the ball go and waited for the man to throw it but he put the ball in his bag instead... I went out to check the sign to see if it said toys were allowed when someone else went over and asked for the ball back for me.... He then claimed my dog bit him and called the police... Long story short the officers gave him a warning and told him to NEVER touch my dog again... Watch out for him!!!They have no idea what color a medium steak should look like. My mother in law sent a filet back twice. Asked twice for bread. Had water refilled twice but not during the meal. Asked for it specially. Luckily the waiter Ryan discounted the bill 75%. That's the only reason it gets 3 stars.  And please leave screaming tired children with a babysitter. My parents and grandparents did not tolerate running through restaurants or screaming at the table.Why not?  Chicken Waffles and Honey on top...  What a place to step out of the normal eating patterns and try this Lolo's Chicken & Waffles if you have never had it.  I consider this a breakfast spot. But when I drive by it at night it does make me hungry.  Whats up with the hundreds of reviews I don't know but a lot people have something to say and I think that's attractive.

I can't say I'm not a fan i have brought people here some like it some don't the price is a little high priced but expected, someone has to pay for their new high end location.  

Don't forget to take a trip to the South Side of Phoenix to the original lolo's.Warning: 1)don't offer full price for a detail, expect $150-$165 for the works (they will start you around $185 offer and come down).  2)don't take the "free windshield". It's a poor job, prob will need resealed, they overcharge your insurance and you'll see it in premiums.  Not to mention, a repairable chip doesn't always warrant total replacement.  3) watch them detail your vehicle - make it obvious you are watching - otherwise steps (like buffing) will likely be skipped. Just remember, Danny's out to make a buck, car wash sales people make a commision and the team of workers doing the wash/detail are probably underpaid - not a great combo.Vietnamese food had never even crossed my mind before, so after someone mentioned Pho Thanh I was interested in trying it. I've been there six times as of now. 

The first time I went to the Pho I didn't have time to eat my meal there so I got take out. I got the number 133, which is a charbroiled slab of beef with steamed rice and veggies (posted a pic of this). Although for me it was more like charbroiled fat and bone; it hardly had any beef at all. My friend ordered the same thing, but he actually got a slab of beef. Maybe I was just unlucky and got the bad part of the "beef". 

On my second trip I got the number 42, which is vermicelli (cold noodles) that come with a pork shrimp sliced egg roll, sliced grilled pork patty, and veggies all in the same big bowl. The pork patty was very good; juicy and tender, the egg roll was good too, and the vermicelli was kind of bland by itself until I mixed it with the veggies which where hidden underneath it, and added a little salt. 

On my third time there I got the number 12 beef noodle soup / pho tai. To me, the broth was just OK but nothing special. Thinking that the broth was just a fluke that day, I got the shrimp pho at a later visit and again I wasn't too crazy for the broth. But I've been to the nearby Da Vang and I loved the pho there. I've ordered it twice and both times it has been great...a little on the salty side, but still better than Pho Thanh's for my personal taste. 

I've also ordered the number 123, which is beef and a salad, with either rice or bread. I chose mine with rice; it goes great with the beef. The salad was OK. The beef was very juicy and tender. I put some beef in the rice a little at a time. They bring out the beef cut in small cube bite size pieces on a metal plate still sizzling loud enough to get the attention of the other diners. 

Also, I've ordered pork shrimp egg rolls as an appetizer, and a banh mi sandwich for take out my four times there. The egg rolls are great; they also come with a plate of veggies and fish sauce to dip the rolls in. I've tried all four sandwiches and my favorite is the number 75 grilled pork sandwich; the patty in this sandwich and the patty that comes with the number 42 are just so juicy and tender! (posted pics of the egg rolls and a sandwich, tho it's the cold cut sandwich) 

Inspired by Da Vang's delicious beef stew / bo kho, I decided to try the beef stew with rice noodles here at Pho Thanh. It was a disappointment. The portion is only half of what Da Vang gives you, and the pieces of beef are not tender and are studded with chunks of fat, and there weren't many noddles to speak of, the opposite of Da Vang's. I ended up leaving all the pieces of beef because they had so much fat on them it was impossible to eat around it. It wasn't very filling In the end it wasn't a very good meal. If you want a generous amount of good beef stew I recommend trying it at Da Vang. 

Da Vang may have the better beef stew, but Pho Thanh has the better bahn xeo crepe. At Da Vang it's really greasy, rock hard, burnt, and very little filling. Here at Pho Thanh it's perfect; not much grease, pliable, and a generous amount of bean sprout, shrimp, and pork filling. 

Having been to both Pho Thanh and Da Vang, I personally prefer Da Vang. Like most Vietnamese places, the prices are great; about less than $10 for a meal, and you will get more than enough food. (Unless you order the beef stew at Pho Thanh lol)I have been coming here for years now. I keep coming back because I love Vietnamese food.  The prices here are super reasonable. I mean how can you beat $4.50 for a bowl of pho?  There tons of items on the menu for less than $6.00. Everything on the menu is pretty solid. Is it the best Vietnamese food ever, not even close. But I compare everything here to the wonderful Vietnamese food I had in California. I'm a bit of a pho snob too. Sadly I will be back when I need a pho fix since my options are pretty limited in Phoenix.

The service here leaves much to be desired. Come here for some solid Vietnamese place and don't expect a fancy place with great service and you'll be ok.This place is ok. The portions are good but the food is merely passable. Might be a good place to have a couple of beers. Would come back for a quick between flight beer but would look somewhere else to eat.Located on 67th avenue, east side of the road, just north of the 101 in a little strip mall.  Weekdays outside of prime breakfast hours are great at this place - no long lines, pleasant employees, etc.  Rush hour and weekend mornings can bring the longer lines, especially for those people who order the egg sandwiches and such.  

Much nicer after the remodeling.A lot of effort clearly goes into many areas of the business here but the end result falls somewhat short of what one imagines the desired goal of the place to be.


 I can't comment on the wine-list as I went with the herd and just ordered Peroni by the bottle (there is nothing on draught) but none of my companions that did have wine voiced any complaints. Cider however is not stocked which strikes me as an oversight. Food-wise the pizzas were large, rustic and well topped. The antipasti starter looked a bit basic (two types of meat and salad greens) but without being able to compare it against the main course version it's hard to know if other places do it better.


 Atmosphere was rather lacking but the rain may have kept folk away + it was also a Wednesday evening. Price-wise two courses for £10.95 was very good value but a new set of business cards are clearly in order as the current ones show 3 courses at that price.


 Not exactly a hidden gem then but one that deserves to be popular with the local students and more long-term residents of its immediate neighbourhood.This is a review of their lunch menu.

The Skinny: food is nothing awe inspiring however the quality of the ingredients is very good (3.5) service: was okay... but I expected something better from a place in the Mandarin Oriental (3) value: appears expensive but portion sizes are commensurate with location and service unless you're talking about the sushi. (3.5)

After going to the Spa at the Mandarin Oriental with my sister, we opted to head here for lunch. (I wasn't looking forward to having my spa smell obliterated by the smell of cigarette smoke, thank you very much.)

I had seen the menus at Mozen Bistro before so I was anticipated my wallet to be raped royally. What I found surprised me.

The lunch menu had several items on it below $20 with very healthy portion sizes. Opting for my standard favourite, I opted for the Smoked Turkey Club ($16; comes with fries and salad). The hubs ordered a kobe beef burger with pretty much unlimited toppings ($28; includes fries and salad).  My sister chose the Thai Beef Salad.

We were started with a lovely basket of various rolls with three dipping sauces. Although the sauces (a tzatztki, a sundried tomato anti-pasti, an olive oil) did not appear to suit the bread that was served (baguette really needs butter), it was definitely nice to have to start the meal. 

For the sandwiches, it came with a rather large portion of fries and salad. The dressing wa a nice light dressing with just the right amount of acidity while the fries were nice and crisp. The generous serving sizes really surprised us given our location (on the Strip) and the cost of the meals.

I really enjoyed my turkey club sandwich. Although I would have preferred real fresh turkey, the amount of quality deli turkey was really good. Add to that a nice assortment of cheese (smoked gouda!), bacon and avocado, it made for a pretty nice big sandwich (I could barely finish half of it... even when I took out 60% of the bread). I do wish that the sandwich was heated to allow the cheese to melt a bit and the meat to be warm but that is personal taste.

Next, the Kobe burger. It's kind of a unlimited toppings deal so my hubby ordered it with bibb lettuce, cheddar, grilled onions, and wild mushrooms. For a fancy place, the burger was a definite two-handed affair.  He could barely get his mouth around that bad boy! It was also prepared perfectly medium rare. I asked him how it tasted. He replied, "Not the best burger I've ever had, but given the quality and quantity - very decent on both accounts".

My sister's Thai beef salad was also quite tasty. Loaded with a ton of ribeye ("there's half a cow in here!"), it was decently priced given the amount of protein. She also indulged in 3 warm rolls to fill in the carb gap.

By now we felt very close to Mr.Creosote (from The Meaning of LIfe), so of course the waiter comes by with three still warm lemon madelines. Not being able to pass these up, we gobbled those beautiful buttery beauties up. I literally did not need to eat until the next morning.

Overall, the service was only okay in my books. Given the caliber of this establishment, there were numerous times we had to signal our slightly vacant waiter to refill water, to get a box for our leftovers, to get our cheque.  Despite this, the staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our meal which is a plus.

Given the quality of the food and portion sizes, this place gets a 3.5 stars. I am definitely interested to try this place again although I will pass on the sushi (I checked an adjacent table's maki which appeared to have way too much rice to filling ratio... that's no good in my  books!).I was staying at the Mandarin, and so I ate breakfast here everyday. For the most part, my breakfasts were quite good, and I really liked the selection of egg dishes. Everything was fresh and very tasty. Service....again quite lacking. I say again, because Twist in the same hotel has issues with service as well. Two out of three mornings, we waited a good 10 minutes at our table before coffee arrived. Understaffed? Learning. training? Perhaps. Second morning, our order was completely messed up to the point where I cannot even explain it. We got up and left, notifying the hostess, our breakfast is included with our room and we are tired of waiting for MORE coffee and the bill...we are going. OF course, they credited our breakfast, and we used the credit at the pool. I hope they can get their act together, it is a really nice place and has so much potential.I don't know what it is about Eteaket that didn't WOW me.  I mean, it's clean and has a great list of teas but, I don't know, something was missing.  Maybe it had to do with feeling like I was in a chain.  Something about the colouring ... I don't know, in my head tea rooms should be a bit like pubs - warm, inviting, kind of funky.  Eteaket didn't really tick any of those boxes for me.

My tea (green Earl Gray) was quite nice, as was the box of creme caramel rooibos that I bought on the rave recommendation of Cressida F.  A bit pricey though - over a tenner for two pots of tea and a box to take away?  That's not too bank account friendly.

All in all it's nice, but doesn't quite give me the tingling feeling that I was hoping for.  Maybe next time I'll just opt to buy a box for home.Before now I would've given this gym 5 stars. I'm a regular there and literally get excited to work out at this 24 hour location. I came in for a tour and I converted over from LVAC (still kept their cheap membership because sometimes I like working out with the bf who refuses to leave them). I am paying over twice the amount for this gym, but for me it was worth it. Not overly huge, not crowded (at least at night when I go), clean facility, bball court, great locker room, and right down the street from my house:) So what's not to love ?

Ummmm how about finding out that your 24hour gym REALLY isn't quite a 24 hour full service gym?! My sister has a membership at LVAC and I've been trying to convert her over the 24 so we can workout together. We both work swing shifts and workout at night. I put her on my list for a week pass (in hopes that I'll obtain a new workout buddy and earn THEM more business). So I kid you not we both get off work at 11pm and our text goes like this:

Sister: meet me at LVAC we can workout together!
me: I can't go to LVAC I'm sorry lol... I'm so unproductive there in fact I'm canceling tomorrow
Sister: one last day. I need you.
Me: dude I can't work out there.
Come to 24(:

She agrees we get to 24 and they're like "oh yeah come back during normal business hours or pay $25" ARE YOU SERIOUS?!? She was on my list they made me create when I signed up -____________-

So this really irritated me because I've never ever been to a gym where they turned away the buddy pass because it wasn't "normal business hours" I can name 2 other chains of gyms around the valley that have a night manager ... In a 24 hour city..... Makes sense to me. And I'm a regular there I'm
Not trying to screw them over I'm trying to bring them business! They couldn't make an exception and note my account for an extra body in their gym? A one-time gesture ? Nothing? Okay. So that pissed me off and my sister wasn't going to pay $25 for a DAY pass. Not a week pass. A DAY pass. So she went home and I felt bad and worked out but couldn't even get a full workout in because I was just unimpressed with the lack of customer service. If I would've just accepted her invitation to the other gym....

Needless to say, I won't be canceling my other gym membership (because miraculously they can make simple things happen) and I'm going to consider canceling this membership. I'm not on a contract with either gym so I'm not losing money either way. You'd just think for a nearly $50 a month membership, you could bring your buddy in for the night and try to get them to switch gyms. 


Yes I love this gym, the location, the machines, etc. But sometimes poor customer service puts a bad taste in your mouth and things aren't ever really the same. 

By the way, I'm not blaming the guy at the desk who "helped" me. I'm sure he was just doing his job, but these policies should really be reconsidered. And the hunt for the perfect gym continues .....It's kinda cool, but a little anti-CLIMBactic (ha..ha..). I would go just to check it out though.  It's a lack-luster "hike" to the top (takes you 2-5 min, depending on how fast you walk). 

We were up there for maybe 4 minutes and then went back down. I suppose it's worth it to see and snap a few shots, just nothing too extraordinary.Went here with friends to use a groupon for Sunday brunch. The wait staff left something to be desired, but the food was decent. I had the french toast which was really sweet and I don't find too many things that I think are too sweet, but I couldn't finish it no matter how much I wanted to. My friends had the massive breakfast sandwich which I sampled and thought it was really good and my other friend had the breakfast hash and said it was only 'ok' not great. The bacon is the best I've had in a long time; really thick and cooked to perfection! The waitress didn't notice that the glass of water she served my friend was majorly cracked and we had to ask about the specials after she took her time coming over to take our drink and food order. The atmosphere and decor was fun. Not sure if we'll go back when I'm in town next, but I'm open to giving this place a second chance.I was recommended here by a friend and was unimpressed considering the price and location. The food was tasty, but not the best Italian I've eaten. The service was a disappointment, the staff seemed frazzled and overwhelmed, even though it wasn't super busy as they were able to seat a party of 8 with no reservation right away. 

The prices were on the high side, but it's Scottsdale so what can you expect. The location was great and the parking was easy. If it were busier, which right now Scottsdale is pretty low in visitation this year then in most, I can see parking being a problem, but fortunately it wasn't.

The ambiance was not comfortable at all. Really noisy, and I can't remember if they played music or not, as you can barely hear the waiter. The staff wasn't as knowledgable or provided any wine recommendations either. You would expect that from a fine dining establishment. 

Definitely not dining here again, but it was worth a try.The process for getting a marriage license couldn't be any easier. We showed up around 8:30am.  There was a short line to get through security and the office to get a license (and passport) is easy to find.  The employees were quite pleasant and efficient.  We were in and out in less than 20 minutes.

The process is simple.  Fill out a form.  Give the clerk your driver's license with the form.  Sign an affidavit and swear everything you filled out is true.  Pay the fee ($76 plus $27.50 for certified copies).  Take license.  It just needs to be signed by the bride, groom, witnesses and an officiant, and mailed back.Similar to Chipotle or Pancheros. I'm sure devotees of those two places can tell the difference if they ate here, but I can't. Overall, it was good food that filled me up at a reasonable price. Definitely good for a quick lunch or dinner. A good substitute for Chipotle or similar if you're in Sun Prairie.ROFLMAO...Seriously???  Seriously???  Ok...food was good...not great!  Long wait with reservations and the service was just ok...!  For the price I'm paying..I don;t want to have to wonder if they are coming to the table to remove used dishes...frankly, for $150 a person...I am expecting them to magically disappeart!!!  

I practically live in high end steakhouses...SORRY Modern...You need to spend more money on product or lower those prices!  I'll pay BUCKS for good food and good service...but, this restaurant need to step up or step out!Gorgeous decor. Handsome staff. Mediocre food. Looks good on the menu.. comes out slowly... and only meh.Ok, if you are going to elect to do this, you have to go in with an open mind and view this as pure entertainment.  I guess my husband and I had too high of expectations.  We really thought we had to crack a serious case or something.  

We paid $30/ each person to do this. While there are 3 cases, the $30 only allows you to pick ONE out of the 3.  If you want to solve the next one, it's another $15, the last one is $10.  Anyway, we picked a case where an actress is found dead with tire tracks on her dress and then saw a small video clip about the experience.  

Ok, before I go any further, keep in mind that this experience is set up so that kids can solve the cases as well.  We walked in thinking we were really crime scene investigators sent to solve a really hard case. :)

After the video, we went to the crime scene where we're supposed look for clues.  We had a pen and paper and my husband and I spent a good amount of time trying to jot down ANYTHING and EVERYTHING that we saw.  We then went to another area where clues from another or the other 2 cases are posted on the walls and you have to look for the color-coding to figure out it's your case.  There's about 5-6 sections to go through to gather clues from forensics to chemical analysis, fingerprinting, analysis of tire tracks to xrays of the rib cage.  Then you're suppose to logon a computer and click on the correct answers and guess who the murderer is. 

It was a fun experience but in all honesty we really thought it would be a more challenging case.  The murderer was pretty easy to figure out and we felt like geeks for overanalyzing every little thing.  Regardless, it was fun to experience this.  Hey, $30 for an hour of entertainment sure beats losing the money in 5 minutes on the slot machine.  :)If you're a fan of the show this is a fun interactive hour. Glad I got my tix from goldstar.com though, the original price is a little steep for what you get. 
You get to play investigator and choose from three different cases. Solve the crime by collecting evidence and screening it in the lab. We all had a good time. But again if you're not a big fan, skip it.I recently spent 4 nights at the TownePlace Suites by Marriott with my husband and our two dogs. Finding a pet friendly hotel that does not have strict weight and/or breed restrictions can be tough, and when your furbabies are pit bulls it's extra challenging. Thankfully Marriott is very accommodating to furry family members. (There is a non-refundable $100 fee for pets, regardless of how long or short your stay is.)

We stayed in a king studio suite which had a small but complete kitchen in it, with a two-burner stove, a dishwasher and a full-sized refridgerator. While the room we stayed in did have everything we needed to get by for few days, it was a rather cramped room for two adults and two large dogs. The property has a rather small area for dogs to do their business, and at night this area is pretty dark.  The walls are also pretty thin. While we didn't have many issues with hearing the people in the rooms next to us, we were on the first floor and we could regularly hear the person in the room above us stomping, I mean walking around. 

The facility has free wifi as well as a business center where guests can go online and print documents at no cost. There is a small workout room, and Marriott guests get free access to the Gold's Gym that is across the street.There is also a laundry room ($1 per load), outdoor pool with gas powered bbqs and a free continental breakfast. All of the employees I interacted with during our staff were very friendly and eager to help with whatever we needed. 

For travelers looking for an extended-stay hotel with all of the basic amenities at a decent price, TownePlace Suites by Marriott is a no frills spot that gets the job done.I really wanted to like this place.  The Fox group does a great job of creating a great dining experience with the theme, decor and menus at their restaurants.  However, the sliders and ice cream sandwiches at Modern Burger were not winners.  The fries were fantastic, the service was great and I really like the idea.  Maybe the food is better at Modern Steak?  I hope so!Stopped in here just for some drinks and apps as we'd already had dinner.  I had the Cabo Flight (3 sample tequila shots) and the Ahi Tuna Ceviche.  Service was prompt, good rock music (lotta Hagar of course).  No complaints.Second time here. First in 2012. Food not impressive. Fish tacos are much better elsewhere. Pork tacos were crazy plain.We were here for NYE this past New Years for the grand opening of the club.

Tiesto was spinning, it was New Years Eve, and my baby's birthday, so I splurged for a VIP table.  Was it worth it?

Well, the club was a bit small, the lighting, video, and sound systems were amazing however.  
There were some problems with service though:
The VIP bottle service client's list got screwed up somehow, so when we arrived that night, they took us to someone else's table, then found out that it belonged to someone else, so we had to be moved.  That kinda sucked, but it may have been attributed to that night being the public grand opening.

Our table hostess Angela was awesome and she totally helped us have an awesome time.  

Overall, I'd probably come back and give it another shot to see if the service issues were an anomaly.  But I'd probably consider Pure or XS before this club.It was too small for the amount of people in there, and I have to say that the talent that came out to the club was eh....

The sound system and lighting is alright, but the bottle service area was too close to the floor there wasn't enough space to relax.had a sicilian pizza that was good....but they put it on foil and it stuck on the foil and that was incredibly annoying....almost had foil for dinner....NO BUENO, MAN.There wasn't the best selection of yogurt flavors and their toppings were far from fresh. It was ok and I'll go back but only because it's close to me and not for the freshness or flavor selection!I had been dying to try Lola's and my friend's birthday was the perfect opportunity! Since there were 4 of us, we decided to go all-out and try a ton of menu items. We made a reservation for Saturday night and were greeted by Lola, herself, at the door. The place is tiny, cozy, and adorable; a true hole in the wall. Here is the low-down on the meal:

Crab cake - I am VERY picky about my crab cakes and these were delicious! Lots of crab and not a lot of filler. A beautiful sear on both sides and the lemon aioli was fantastic. The crab cakes were second only to my own.

Craw-puppies - hush-puppies with Crawfish mixed in the batter, very inventive! These were crispy and delicious, but maybe a touch too soft/undercooked in the middle.

Gumbo - The gumbo looked good and started off great on my palate, but lacked seasoning, mainly salt, and spice.

Catfish and grits - OMG the cheesy grits were unbelievable, I literally did not want to eat the last bite. The catfish was cooked perfectly, but not exactly what I expected. They even gave me some crispy bread to soak everything up. 

My dining companions had Po-boys and raved about the bread. I was able to steal some french fries and was so glad I did, they were fantastic. My husband had the trout, it wasn't bad but it was a little on the fishy side for me. 

Sweet Potato Pecan Pie - I wish there was more sweet potato and less pecan, but paired with the chantilly cream it was delicious and I found myself constantly going back for just one more bite.

Lola's Famous Bread Pudding - I am not a fan of bread pudding, but my friends forced me to take a bite and it really wasn't bad.

Banana's Foster - The highlight of dessert, we were literally watching each spoonful and silently hating each other for having good taste! It was the best banana's foster I have ever had. A delicious sweet brown sugar coating with the warm bananas and cold vanilla ice cream...yes please!

Overall, Lola's is a great Cajun alternative to the real deal. There were definitely some high points to the meal, but there were a few mediocre points as well. I wish they had live jazz, that would really create some true NOLA ambiance. I will definitely be back to check out more of the menu and I am so glad we have a great Cajun restaurant in Las Vegas!Bad news here. My husband and I went to OYSY tonight but only found a shocking news: the store is closed and there was even a sign on the door says "everything must go by Apr. 30" ....

We were so shocked and confused.. we always thought that OYSY's running a pretty good biz coz when we visited it on weekends there were always many ppl..

I'm already missing its king crab.. sorry to see you go, OYSY! :(Came here for a Happy Hour after some work meetings in town. This place is nice, but I will say my time was ruined..as there were about 4 families, all with loud kids screaming.

Not to be rude, but I do to happy hour to unwind..and I am not sure this place did the trick. It is nice atmosphere  and very fancy, which drives the price, but  hard to enjoy fancy with babies around.Came here to avoid traffic before heading back to Cali. My cousin suggested it because with a players card dinner is only $15. One card is good for 4 people. It was worth $15 for sure! It reminded me of a fancier Hometown Buffet. The food wasn't gourmet like buffets in Vegas, but it was fancier than other "normal" buffets with normal buffet food. They had prime rib station which is always a plus. They also had a taco making station. Also, you could make your own pasta. The salad was delish too. My sweet tooth was satisfied because they had a little dessert buffet. We were there at closing so most of the good dessert was gone, but they still had some of their good bread pudding and of course ice cream! I got vanilla and ordered a root beer and made a root beer float. =D This ended the night for me. I was stuffed! Definitely got my $15 worth! Would consider coming here again if I needed to kill time before heading home.The road to get here has ALOT of curves.  If you have motion sickness like I do, you will definitely want Dramamine or sleep through it.

The restaurant decor itself is fun to look at. There are dollar bills all along the walls.  The bar has saddles for seats.  I definitely would like to see someone who has had a few too many try to get off. My friend and I happened to sit at the bar.  We were given menus and told "we are known for our burgers and chili".  My friend ordered a bowl of chili that was served with cheese and sour cream.  I had the chili dog with tortilla chips.  The chili was decent.  It has a very slight kick to it.  Nothing to brag about.  

They also have Mule Oil and Rattlesnake Venom beer on tap which is unique to this establishment.  I was told the Mule Oil is a lighter beer.  It is similar to Bud Light, and I wasn't that impressed.  I inquired about the Rattlesnake Venom in the hopes of trying a better beer. (By the way, they do not give samples).  I asked the bartender if the Rattlesnake Venom beer was like an IPA.  He looked at me and said "I don't understand what you mean.  I don't drink."  This statement baffled me.  I respect his decision not to drink, but if you are a bartender you should be knowledgeable about the drinks that you serve.  Just saying.  I decided not to try the Rattlesnake Venom.This was my second time here, the first time I had it, the cheeseburger was sooooo good, but this time it wasn't so great.Cheap prime rib. I wasn't expecting much, but it was not bad at all. The Rolls were decent but the mashed potatoes were pretty bad. I like garlic probably a little more than the next guy but wow were these potatoes garlicy. So much so that I couldnt eat them. My wife had the ribs, which had leftovers of :) Again not bad at all. Service was fine. No complaints. It wasnt busy att all while we were there. Oh, and for those of you that are on the shorter side: sit at a table with chairs, not a booth.The chicken was fresh and very tasty first time there but greasy cant make it a habitReally not bad. Kind of reminds me of Karben4 (and they serve their beer!), but with a much more inviting ambience. Good beer selection. My hair wasn't blown back or anything, but I wouldn't mind going back.Nice contemporary setting that is classy but also casual feeling since it's very open and there's a lot of foot traffic passing by.  

Items I enjoyed in no particular order: codfish fritters, scallop ceviche, and huevas estrellados (greasy goodness, perfect hangover food!). 

A few I did not: wrinkled potatoes (various pieces were undercooked), stuffed dates, and sangria that was severely watered down and therefore seemed like a poor value.

Also had the pata negra.  At $30 for a serving size less than a ghetto Carl Buddig pack (mmm Carl Buddig), I expected to have some sort of culinary revelation.  Instead it was tasty but I have to say I was underwhelmed.  But maybe I just don't know how to enjoy pata negra. I'm not going to pass judgment though on this particular pata negra until I have the chance to try it elswhere.  

Overall, a good meal with some highs and lows. Reasonably priced by vegas standards.  They haven't even been open a month and it's likely they will improve.  I'd consider it a 3.5* with potential.  I'm eager  to come back and give it another shot down the road.The food was good.  Nothing fancy, but certainly of quality.  They have a simple menu, we ordered a variety of items, all of which were prepared well and tasted good.

We did share a pancake.   It was a memorable pancake.  Light and tasty!  

I ordered ham and eggs.  Ham was less salty, which I prefer.  The 9 grain toast was delicious.

My sig-o ordred the egg white vege omelet with fruit.   Fresh, good quality and the sun-dried tomatoes were "yummy."

Good service. 

If there weren't as many flies, there'd be 4 stars.Root beer is delicious.  Service is very good.  It's hidden waay in the back of a strip of stores so you won't see it driving by.  Enjoyed or meals.Ok, this just wasn't my cup of tea. I tried many of the flavors in the store and really struggled to find some I liked. I wound up buying 10 mini bags of various flavors for my coworkers just to make sure I got some variety. 

The sweet flavors of popcorn were crazily coated in a hard sugar shell and quickly became overwhelming sweet. 

The savory flavors were thickly coated in flavored powder. My fingers looked like after they do when you eat Cheetos, all powdery and coated, after a few handfuls. The flavors just didn't taste all that great to me. 

I also just got the low salt variety which didn't really taste like anything. I actually have made more flavorful popcorn at home. When I just pop the corn and put a tiny pinch of sea salt on it.  

Maybe its the smell I was missing. The store didn't smell like wonderful popcorn.  It didn't smell like anything at all. Also there was no hot popcorn available. 

I did enjoy the almond toffee flavor and the Chicago mix (sweet and savory mixed together). 

I'm not against trying more flavors but it is not a place I would go out of my way for again.

The counter help was very patient and helpful.Very busy during lunch and dinner rushes, with lines that stretch out the door. 

I've been to Chipotles where the servings are nice and ample, where the servers frequently pile on two scoops of tender meat into a burrito stuffed with calorically-dense goodness. This is not one of those Chipotles. I expect that the hiring process includes harvesting new employee souls and grinding into their tortilla mix. The employees here have never smiled.Great price for Happy Hour, food is good, but the service needs working on.They did a decent job. I've had my eyebrows threaded for years in California by the same girl and she was the best.  I came here and they didn't quite give me the shape I wanted though it could be me cause my eyebrows are very light.  In my defense I went to another threading location and got a great shape. If you're around the area you can try it out for yourself but I wasn't too impressed.  The front desk guy was really friendly though, I love when the front desk is friendly it makes your experience that much better.We started out the day headed to Comicon but after seeing the CA-RAZY long line, we changed our minds. The BF suggested we go to Fashion Square to shop...WOOT!  We found this place almost by accident, just driving by and the name caught my eye...definitely happy we stopped here for lunch! 

The waiter was prompt, pleasant and efficient. Our food was excellent. I got the Spring veggie salad -- so fresh with an awesome vinaigrette! The BF got an amazing Pub Burger -- so big and juicy (but he immediately picked off the tomato)! I wanted to order the 12-hr Roasted Tomatoes and "Crusty bread w/ good Olive oil" for an appetizer. The tomatoes almost tasted like they were kinda pickled...and they were cold, which we didn't expect, but SO tasty! Sweet just like candy! BTW...It was after ordering this that I witnessed a first...THE BF ACTUALLY ATE THESE TOMATOES! Now THAT is saying something! I was totally blown away and actually took a picture! :o) 

With such a diverse menu, there is something for everyone...the little "checklist" appetizer menu was kind of neat in my opinion. Roasted beets, different little tapas-like meats and cheeses, crusty bread w/Olive oil...you could make a meal out of all that stuff alone! 

Tons of different drink options is always a plus too...even though I didn't get a drink at lunch, I saw LOTS of different ones I would have liked to try if it hadn't been 2:00 in the afternoon! 

All in all, I was very pleased and would definitely go back. There are so many more interesting things to try!I was a little bummed when we checked out Mabel's due to the fact that i was STARVING and their stoves were apparently out so the only thing available was cold food ...wompwompwomp. It was freezing outside and i wanted something warm so I had to settle with the liquid diet (not that im complaining). The drinks were very tasty that we tried, they have a nice selection of drinks they make and a nice selection of food to choose from (given the stove is not broken). Atmosphere is very nice and relaxing.  Service was pretty good except the few times our waitress was MIA. We got a big old booth for just the two of us to snuggle up in and act lovey dovey and enjoy the ambiance. I will be back again because there were items on their list I am determined to try.Went to Mabel's for Happy Hour the day before July 4th (err, that would be July 3rd). Very quiet, pre-holiday crowd. Service was prompt and very good. Cocktails were a bit disappointing, I had a sazerac which was fair and an old-fashioned (even though I hate it when they dilute good whiskey with soda in an old-fashioned, which this place did). Appetizers were fair....the deviled eggs "with caviar" were mostly sans caviar, which was a bummer. The butter lettuce salad was decent. 4 stars for service, 3 for cocktails, 3 for food. Maybe just hit an off-night, I'll give 'em another chance.I went here tonight with a group after we went on our Art Walk. We sat a a nice table outside. We were starving and everything on the menu looked good. I ordered mac n cheese and chicken lollipops. Luckily I had good company and we had alot to chat about because it took over an hour for our food to come out. In fact the waitress brought us a complimentary cheese plate and cocktails because the food was taking so long. I had a cocktail called the Penicillin which was good. I also had a glass of Reisling and that also was good. Eventually our food did come out. Well some of it, I never got my mac n cheese. But the chicken lollipop was so good and succulent. The presentation was great too. The best thing about that dish was the blue cheese, it was so good I wanted to bring some home. Definitely worth going back for the blue cheese. The service was nice, she was very polite and apologetic about the delay with our food. Like I said, I would go back for the blue cheese, hopefully it wouldn't take as long next time. I felt like they went above and beyond to make sure we left happy.First rule of Brunch Club is that if you're going to be serving brunch, you have to be ready to serve brunch. The brunch crowd wants their food. They want eggs and pancakes and bacon and toast. Stat. At the very least they want coffee or a mimosa pronto.

Second rule of Brunch Club is to offer enjoyable breakfast items. I was sad to arrive here for Smunch one day and order something on the lunch side of brunch. For the first time. In my life. A chicken pita?

Don't get me wrong, the food was fantastic. Anything that sounds good usually is at Pita Jungle. They were also great with separate checks. I just think that brunch is a little lacking and could use some guidance. From true brunchers and breakfast enthusiasts.I've been to Sprecher's quite a few times now since they've opened and I've never really been disappointed.  As a big fan of the brewery I was excited to hear a restaurant serving their beers was opening in my area, if only for the opportunity to get Black Bavarian on tap.  In fact I'd probably just keep coming back for that alone but fortunately there are few other things they offer on top of one of my favorite beers ever.  

The first few times I was meeting my father for lunch on Fridays, usually a bit later in the afternoon as I tend to get off work around 1.  My father especially likes the lunch salad and soup AYCE special and frankly all you'd ever need to do to get his undying devotion is offer him anchovies on the side of his Caesar salad.  Sprecher's does this, hence our repeated returns.  I like their combo specials and usually get the chicken wrap with their house salad.  My only complaint is the wraps are always open-ended and sometimes these can devolve into a hell of a mess.  The place always seems to be packed for lunch but since we usually arrive a bit later we tend to catch the tail end of the rush.  That sometimes means the service is a bit slow as we might catch a shift change or something, but overall I've never had any issues worth getting worked up over.  The lunch prices were probably a dollar or two higher than I'd pay normally but nothing egregious.  I could see it being loud if we were at the tables in the middle of the room but we've always been seated in the booths along the walls.

After getting used to the lunch atmosphere it was a bit different to come here later at night for dinner.  The bar area gets livelier but the dining area can be a bit empty depending on the night.  I definitely like coming here when I can enjoy a Black Bavarian or two - it's one of my favorite beers ever and finding it on tap somewhere is always a treat.  Once I did experience a soapy glass but the bartender was quick in getting me a replacement.  One of these days I might just try one of the other Sprecher beers but as of now my thirst for Black Bavarian has not been slaked.  The burgers are quite good - I last had half of my sister's BBQ burger which completely invalidated my "healthy" wrap choice.  I also recommend the chicken sandwich, which pairs bacon and gouda with a tasty mustard, and also the turkey, bacon and guac sandwich.  I've never tried the Friday fish fry but a friend of mine seemed to like it when he ordered it.  I have had the brewpub tacos, deep fried tilapia with an interesting spicy slaw.  They're not too bad at all despite the fact I'm not usually a fan of the fried variant.  The sides are usually good.  My default choice is always the sweet potato fries which are crinkle-cut and dusted with a bit of sugar.  The beer cheese potatoes aren't bad either but depending on the entree can be a bit too much.  One of these days I'll try the sauerbraten or the schnitzel but it hasn't happened yet.  Dinner prices are more in line with expectations and the prices for the beer ($5 for a stein, $4 during happy hour) are a steal.  The quality of service has always been great for dinner and I can't recall a time that was less than satisfactory, so it's become one of my favored dinner destinations in the area.Heard the hype, wanted to try.

Pros:
Huge portions
Great Service

Cons:
More food, less taste
Overpriced for the quality

I weigh my reviews heavily on the quality and taste of the food. The food at this place was okay at best. The portions are bigger than Claim Jumpers, but the flavors were sub par. I split the sage chicken and waffles with a friend (there is a two or three dollar charge to split the plate.)  

When we got it, it was so nicely presented and huge. I was shocked. I didn't know where to start. When I tried the waffle, it tasted plain. I really needed the syrup with it, but there was bacon baked inside of it and I did not like to mix sweet and savory. The chicken was cooked well, nice and tender, but again it was plain. There was no real spices to it. I had to dunk it in my friend's sauce to finish off one piece. After a while, the flavors mixed together and everything became sickening to eat and look at. 

My friend ordered sage chicken with the eggs benedict. His plate was huge as well. He had chicken, eggs benedict, a biscuit, and mash potatoes all covered with hollandaise sauce. Literally everything was covered in a blanket of sauce. After a while, he too gave up. He is a pretty big guy and if he gave up, I'm sure the food was too much and too overwhelming after a while. 

My favorite part of the meal was the watermelon-kiwi lemonade. You have to order it. Comes with a piece of watermelon on the side. Very yummy. I tasted more watermelon than lemonade, but that's okay since I don't really find watermelon drinks anywhere. 

Don't believe the hype. The food will overpower your taste buds, and not in a good way.We came here for breakfast.  We checked in and waited.  And waited and waited.  The lines were very long.  We finally got a seat and were very excited to sit down and enjoy a fabulous breakfast.  

Food was just ok.  We got the fried chicken/mashed potatoes/egg combo (forgot what it was called) and a Chorizo skillet.  The skillet was far better than the other dish and this surprised me.  The order on the eggs was wrong (brought scrambled-- ordered over medium) and we waited almost until the end of our meal for this to be corrected.  We also had bloody marys and they were also just ok. 

This place is fun; presentation of food is unique and I think it is better than most places for breakfast, but I think Vegas is full of overrated places like these.Alright, so here's the deal with this place. My husband and I have a hard time finding restaurants that will please us both. I am
More of a foodie. He hates anything pretentious with small servings. This place is our happy medium. Good food , LARGE servings and a hipster ambience. Love the one in San Diego. Vegas location has a totally different vibe...kinda trashy and in a crappy casino. Food was still good though.This Culver's location just opened up in my neighborhood so I ventured in.  The entire staff was working.  They were completely over staffed.  I guess it is better to be safe than sorry for a grand opening.  There was not a line so I walked right up to the cashier and ordered a Deluxe Double Burger.  I was up sold from fries to cheese curds.  I asked the cashier were this business started and she told me Wisconsin.  She tried to sell me custard too.  I said no.  I took my number, went to the soda fountain and filled my cup with Culver's own Root Beer.  I sat down and waited for my burger and cheese curds.  Of course the place was clean, it is brand new.  (Lets see if it stays that way)  They have a large flat screen that was playing sports.  The walls had Biblical quotes from Proverbs.  Am I in the banquet hall from the church next door?  I quickly looked under my cup to see if there were anymore quotes.  No quotes.  It did have a question though.  "What flavor are you?"  Gee!! I don't know, Spicy Mexican maybe.  My burger came and it was wet with oil or butter or water.  It was juicy.  Not a bad burger but not great.  The cheese curds were nice.  I like cheese, and the fact that it is battered and deep fried is all the more sinful.  My arteries were screaming at me and saying "why are you eating this?"  I enjoyed the Root Beer.  I went for a refill on my way out.  The total for my meal was $7.79.  I will go back to Culver's but not often.  My craving for cheese curd will have to kick in for me to go back.  A-OK.this place is fine. If you need some quick pizza before you catch a movie, it will do. If you're looking for a great place to grab a slice of NY Style pizza, it's alotta hype. service is good, pizza is mediocre. The crust is usually hard and slightly dried. If I hadn't had pizza for a week, it'll do.First thing I noticed was the whole place smelled like fart. Then we were taken to the  wedding counter. the guy who was supposed to help us just sat there and messed with the computer for about 5 mins before speaking to us. terrible service!  We had been to the same location 2 years prior when we were getting married instead of just attending one. Their whole attitude towards us then was 180 degrees of what it was today. They really need to learn that all of their customers count and they all deserve to be treated courteously and with respect.
Only reason they got 3 stars from me is averaging the 2 experiences.Very nice museum and a great way to spend a few hours and escape the summer heat!  However, there is so much information in this museum that it is overwhelming...and they plan to expand with over 20% more information.I love Old Navy for the sales really.  Things priced at the regular price are not quality enough to warrant the price.  This location is good, I hate the clearance area it's always a mess.  But this is without a doubt the friendliest location in the west valley.Anyone who knows me or has taken the time to read any of my reviews knows my love of a good sandwich. This place offers one of your best chances to get a really good italian beef sandwich here in Arizona period. 

Yes the walls are covered in old newspaper clippings and yeah they do plaster the word Chicago all over the place but what stands out is the food. My sandwich was big and loaded with hot and well seasoned beef that was dripping from the magical meat juices they cook it in. To help round out my meal I ordered a small order of fries. 

I would have to say that the lady who took my order seemed like she was tired and wanted to go home or just hated her job because she never smiled and just stared for the most part. She never offered assistance to me or my dining partner for this Midwest lunch run. Now I do not want to give this place a bum wrap or take away well deserved stars for the rudeness of a few employees, but when they are the ones who are in charge of not only greeting your customers, but also making sure they feel welcome is it not important that they do their job correctly? 

I do not expect someone to offer a fake smile, and kiss up to me as a customer no I don't. But what I do expect is fair prices, good food, and a nice experience. If one of those elements is messing then chances are it will be a long time before I come back if at all. Bottom line this place has a nice selection of Vienna beef dogs, hamburgers, and sliders. The fries are good and crispy but as for the service, I recommend getting your food to go. Enough said!

Case closedI have been living here from the past 6 months . Management is great , very friendly and very helpful. Services are done immediately . 
Pros: Nice community, friendly management apartments are spacious.
Cons: They only have Century link and Noisy (by gardeners, cleaner) quite often.We got the new philly steak sandwich.  It was very good, people were friendly, and the horsey sauce was plentiful.  Wish they had coke products,Not really impressed.  I spent nearly $10 for two tacos, rice beans and a drink.  The tacos were okay, kind of bland actually.  For the money I feel like I could do better elsewhere.They have tons of memorabilia on the walls here, hell we sat under Tom Cruise's pants! They were short.

The food was decent here. We started with the wings and then I had a burger and fries. Nothing really sticks out to me, so it was really neither bad nor good. 

The tv was on a constant loop so we got to see the red carpet premiere of the Hangover 2 several times in the hour or so we were here.

Everything was relatively expensive, but hey, it's Vegas!Fiance had a conference at Cosmo so I came out to hang for a couple of days. 

While the vibe is super hip & trendy and you absolutely can't beat the atmosphere in the casino, I wasn't THAT impressed with the hotel itself (meaning the rooms & service). 

I think the conference room rate was $190/nt, which got us a room literally at the end of the hallway. No balcony, 2 queen beds (an upgrade to a King would've been +$75/nt), and not even motorized drapes? 

I've eaten at Holsteins, China Poblano, and Secret Pizza....overall they have a nice variety of food options and of course there's lots within walking distance at other resorts. For conference-goers, my fiance says the catered food they served her group was quite good. 

While it's nice that Cosmo doesn't have a resort fee, now I'm annoyed having to pay a la carte for all the stuff I have now come to expect. Want internet? $14/day. Want to use the gym? $20/day. I'm used to paying a resort fee at every major hotel on the strip, I'd rather you just charge me rather than feel like I'm getting nickel & dimed to death. 

Final nuisance: none of the dealers/pit bosses wear name tags. After a few drinks I like to get chatty with my dealer, it's common courtesy to at least know their name. 

I'll come back to Cosmo to drink and people watch, but I wouldn't spring for a room there....if I'm spending that much, I'll stay at the Wynn/Encore every time.First time staying at the Cosmopolitan and it will probably be the last. There were highs, but there were also a LOT of lows. 

Check-in: Two minute wait. Originally booked Terrace Studio - asked if we want to upgrade to view of The Bellagio Fountains? Well, absolutely. Yes, please. Very friendly and helpful staff.  

The room: Nice size, huge private terrace with the MOST FANTASTIC VIEWS I've ever had in a Vegas room. But the room itself - nothing particularly impressive about it. Can't compare to the two room suite at THEhotel or the high tech rooms at the Aria. Took off my sandals and what?...is the carpet wet? Eww! Right outside the bathroom area - did something overflow? OMG! Then walked to the "bedroom." Carpets wet there as well. OK, called front desk - "The carpets in my room are wet. Did they by chance get cleaned today or something?" "Let me check...yes mamm...today at 3:15." Huh. They disn't have another Terrace Studio w/ View available...or oddly the one without the view we had just upgraded from. The only option was to upgrade to the Terrace Suite and they weren't sure if we would be willing to pay the difference in price. Uh, no! The gentleman was very apologetic and gave us a $100 food and drink credit. Still didn't change the fact we walked around on damp carpet for 2 days, but the person was really nice and apologetic. 

The room cont. - housekeeping/maintenance: Could have been cleaner for sure. A random hair on the half wall that separates the living area from the bedroom. More hairs in the bathroom vanity drawers - gag! There was a lipstick stained cig butt on the balcony that wasn't mine. Realized after the first night's sleep, the sheets had those little balls all over them that happen when they get old (what's that called?). The sink drain in the "kitchen" area had obviously never been cleaned. The filthy drain was hidden by the sink stopper. Having only been open for 3 years, the room certainly was a little worse for wear. Wallpaper in the WC already peeling and carpeted entry to every room door so soiled it almost looked like it was supposed to be deep grey color it was. Speaking of doors, the doors to the room literally weigh ~100 lbs and despite their heaviness they are far from soundproof as all you here day and night is the slam (and feel the bam) of neighboring room doors slamming shut. Oh, the building was originally built as condominiums but bought out by Marriot (yup, Cosmo is a Marriot hotel - didn't know that) and turned into a casino...so there was a nifty little dishwasher in our "kitchenette" if we found the need. I met a gal at the pool who had a full size washer and dryer in her room. The Cosmo never bothered to remove the condo items. Hmm...  

Room service: Who gets room service in Vegas? This gal, because I have to have my eggs first thing in the a.m. and I'm not dragging my ass down to a restaurant before at least brushing my hair - plus I had to use up those room credits. Fast delivery, very friendly staff, food A-OK but very inconsistent. Ordered the same thing two days in a row and cooking and preso were completely different. 

Restaurants: Couldn't say. Didn't dine at any because 1.) none really looked appealing compared to all of the thousand choices around us and 2.) I hadn't heard good things about any of them, and 3.) we had several free events to attend. Oh wait. I lie. My husband and I did each get a slice of pie from Secret Pizza one VERY late night. It was A-OK. 

Casino: Comparatively small. Mostly slots, not a lot of tables. Lowest Blackjack I found was $25 a hand. I guess I can't really complain though because my "luckiest person in the world" husband landed some $$$$ on the slots during our last night. :) Great drink service. Always around and super friendly. 

The Spa: Very pretty, natural stone walls...tiny! Got nothing on the Wynn! One hot tub, dry sauna, wet sauna. BUT, if you don't have any treatment done it is only $30 for a day pass - others are typically ~$75+. Again, great customer service. Are you noticing a trend here yet? 

The pools: Three to choose from. All are pretty small and boring (got nothing on Mandalay Bay). And, after about 2pm in June no direct sun because of the surround buildings casting a shadow. All three on different floors - just poor design. Lots of people (including) me walking around, changing loungers, to try to get an extra 10 mites of vit D. Towel guys and gals, and poolside servers really nice.  

Overall: Very nice customer service all around (expect at the Chandelier where the bartenders are not only lazy, but also pompous asses). Great location in the heart of The Strip (City Center) and breathtaking views. BUT, compared to the dozen+ comp for price Casino and Resorts I've stayed at in Las Vegas...the Cosmpolitan would, sadly, not be at the top of my list. Honestly, this should be closer to a 2 star review, but all of the nice staff...and  the view, oh the view!I'm gonna keep this one short and simple.

Ive been here a dozen times and never been disappointed nor have I been amazed. Its just like your regular chain restaurant good food not great but good, good service, and good prices. I always order something different every time I come here and have never not liked the food. I usually start with an appetizer like the jalapeno onion strings or there southwest egg rolls mmm those egg rolls are so yummy! As for the main course Ive had it all Chicken fried steak, mini sliders, crispy chicken crispers and recently their new cajun chicken pasta. All were good but let me tell you the new cajun pasta is delicious its creamy goodness and their very generous with the chicken its definitely a must try! 

So overall cant really go wrong with this place for a cheap decent meal.There pizza here is awesome!  I find myself here for lunch once in a while with work friends.  About once every three months.  I would go more often, but the service... oh the service....

The service during lunch, brings this place down from a 5 star pizza place to a 3 star place.

Drink refills are always lacking, late and never there.  It almost seems like they're understaffed.  The pizza takes a looooong time to get out of the kitchen.  By then we're irritated and extremely hungry.  

At that point, we just eat as quickly as possible and leave.   

Your waitresses need to check in and give more refills.  The only time we see them is: 1 Taking our order, 2 checking in AFTER the pizza comes, and 3 to give us our check.Sorry PT's......I've been back multiple times since my first review and let me just say that it has been lacking in service since then. I came here for lunch today and it wasn't very busy at all. It took them about 25 minutes to get us our nachos. I asked for our check once we got our nachos which took about another 10 minutes. I like the food, but the service needs a lil help.i went to this experience in december 2010. a few things went wrong. a few things went right.

what went wrong? the HIDDEN SCAM. i paid around $2000 total (drove a ferrari and lambo murcie as well as bought repeated drift experiences for me and my wife) for the entire experience. that isn't the scam. the scam is that they charged my card that much money and then one month later i got a magical surprise on my bill. turns out the lady in nevada never told me that they have an offshore company in france or italy. i forget the country. i was hit with a foreign exchange fee plus a foreign transaction. when they ran my card info in their computer, they were sending that approval to europe, not america. i had no clue this was happening. of course, they did not refund that fee to me. i am not sure why they were doing this (are they still doing this 2 years later??) but they should tell me that their business is based somewhere in europe. the dishonesty was bad.

next, it was too cold to enjoy the experience in december. this is my own responsibility on one hand. i would not go here during the winter. on the other hand, i was wearing a jacket and there was no real heater that i can remember under the awning where the cars are kept. it was uncomfortable. they make so much money that they can at least make a room which is heated and has a TV with some dollar store cookies and soft drinks. this penny pinching made me regret how poorly they manage this business.

next, the awful 1998 webcam they have installed. again, they make so much money, how much does it cost to install a good camera inside the vehicles? i can find a setup for about $500 at bh photo. i had to waste one of my laps to allow my instructor to drive so i could record the steering wheel, the road, and the experience because he refused to record me (i had an expensive but small and light HD camcorder with optical stabilization). their own video which i purchased is unacceptable 280p blur. the audio is also nonexistent. from what i see on these reviews, they have not listened to their customers and have not upgraded their equipment. funny thing is all smartphone cameras are better than their cameras inside of these cars and those phones cost just a few hundred dollars and do so much more. i have no clue why they don't listen to their customers. you can see the footage from my experience recorded by my own HD camcorder (with high quality audio) on youtube. my username is fakedodgeviperguy. you will see my experience, the garage, and some drifting footage i captured.

what went right? you do get to drive a supercar or supercars. the prices are reasonable for a once in a lifetime experience. i also realize dealing with people is not easy and not every customer experience will be spot on. i can tolerate the cold weather and standing around with no heat, the awful webcam (i didn't have to purchase that package - it was optional), but the lying about the credit card scam thing was unacceptable. there are some things no company has an excuse for. the instructors were also nice but they are just drone employees. they don't get to make decisions (i had to use one of my own paid-for laps to let the instructor drive so i could hold the camera and record the experience because he refused to do so while i was driving. why? bad customer experience) so they were just doing their job, nothing more, nothing less. 

if you go, go during the summer or fall (nevada has high heat but low humidity so it's still comfortable and you are in comfy shorts tshirt and flip flops) and pay in cash so you don't fall into the scam like i did. overall though i would check out other companies (there are a few that do this in america). you have the internet. do your research.Halloween Mart is a big store filled with what feels little selection. They break down their inventory into themes which makes for easy browsing. The aisles are narrow and gets jammed easily. They do not have any dressing rooms so the sample costumes must be worn over clothes. They most likely frown on the public nudity, so try a size and guess if you should go bigger or smaller is the name of the game. I have been on a superhero kick lately. They have a nice selection of higher quality outfits and accessories, but you will be paying a premium for them. I just can't wait until November 1st because I will be taking advantage of that 40% discount. Be sure I will not ever miss another superhero pub crawl again. You might see me switching costumes as often as bars.I tried coming here at 7am on a weekday which was bad, huge line made me come back on a Saturday at which time I ordered a cookie crunch machiatto frap, I was interested in a Cap'N Crunch Frap, but I didn't have the recipe on-hand since it's from the secret menu so I opted out of that order since the girl didn't know it off the top of her head since she said alot of people come in with new secret menu orders, so it wasn't a big deal but the cookie frap I got wasnt bad, but a little too much ice blended in so it lost a bit of the flavor.I decided to try this place based on the reviews. All I can say is it is NOT the best pizza in town.  The sauce is a lite too sweet for my liking.  That being said the rest of the experience was great.  Online ordering was easy. Pickup was on time. Service was great. I would say if you like a sweeter sauce this is pretty good pizza. Just not my favorite.The Skinny: some pretty great entrees, some not so good... skip the bread pudding (3) service: slow service - took a while to place our orders(1.5), value: remains to be seen (2).

After the great experience the last time, we brought all our friends to feel the love that is Mundo. But the love just wasn't there tonight.

It took a while for us to order our dishes and to hear even what the specials were tonight. It basically took at least 15 minutes to wait for our waiter to come around and take our order.

I got the roasted chicken dish with tamales which was excellent - great flavours. Paired with the sweet tamales, and I was in heaven. My husband ordered the filet which was only alright. The side of mushroom didn't appear to be "wild" at all - yup! $8 for a small side of plain old button mushrooms. Would definitely not recommend this side.

Another member of the table ordered the tortilla soup and taquitos which she said were both good.

Unfortunately, the carnitas was a rather poor compared to the other dishes on the table. Like a previous reviewer noted - some appeared dry. 

We did order the bread pudding which was fair at best. Nothing special. Would probably not order again.

Service, as I mentioned, was slow tonight and the timing of the dishes were poor.

Overall, a significantly less pleasant experience than the last time. I'm downgrading this place to a 3 instead of a 4.Pretty solid lunch. Everything was fresh and tasty. The guy who made my sandwich however was slow and even though I repeated what I wanted several times he forgot my green bell peppers.We went here when the Sundance Grill was closed for cleaning after 11pm.  The girl Sarah was very helpful even though they were OUT OF HOAGIE BUNS!   I was devastated since I was craving Philly Cheese steak.

I'll tell ya what. They have better  Philly's than inside Sundance Grill.Checked this place out since I wanted some boba.  This place is quick.  They offer a wide variety of fresh fruits.   l liked the Milk Tea with Boba and Lychee Jelly.  We all tried something different, Peanut Butter and Banana w/ no Boba, Red Bean w/ boba and Lychee and coconut w/ boba.  All were a hit.  Looking for something fresh on a hot day, recommend checking this spot out.
I think they have a $5 min. if you want to use your credit card.Todd English PUB has rich hearty pub food. I love the decor and the windows that open into Aria. We had the chicken pot pie and fish and chips. Both were great. The potpie had a film crust and very rich filling (heavy cream probably). Our waitress was attentive and helpful.  
The only complaint I have is the hostess service. When I arrived I was looking into the restaurant for the rest of my party and they did not offer to help or see if they were there. I ended up waiting outside and then calling my party to find they were already seated. This one of my biggest pet peeves with restaurants. Your first impression when you walk into the restaurants sets the tone for the entire meal. If your hostess service is good, you probably will overlook flubs throughout the meal.
