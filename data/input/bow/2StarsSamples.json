Coffee is fine, although I agree with Laura F. below. Service has always been VERY slow, despite 3 baristas working at the counter. I'd recommend not stopping here on your way to work, but its an OK place to pick up a latte on the weekend or get a bottle of wine.I nicknamed my "lunch special" the "recession plate," as my portion was significantly smaller than my table mates. The food was okay, just kind of fatty. The corn muffins had so much butter it was nauseating - and i love butter. 

The only thing that saved this place was the chocolate bar i purchased in the store area. That shit was good.The food here is good.  The curry plates are especially delicious.   Too bad the service is so stand-offish.  I've been here close to 10 times and every single time I've left thinking I should have just gone to Thai Hut a mile away instead, based solely on the long wait and inattentive staff.Hated it! Remember the In Living Color sketch, Men on Film? No? Basically just say "hated it" in a sassy gay voice and that is exactly how I feel about the Hotel San Carlos. Maybe snap your fingers and pierce your lips after saying it too. 

I thought it would be fun. I thought it would be cool. I drove by a million times and said to myself, "I wanna get a room there one of these days." Unfortunately, when that day arrived I was severely disappointed. 

I knew it was old and I thought that would be part of the charm, but it wasn't. That's the problem. It's just old and crappy, not historic and charming. There is a difference. Maybe it would have been more charming if the staff knew what they were doing. Not a single basic question I asked could be answered by the girl working at the front desk. The vallet guy was NEVER around. NEVER. So that made it a little hard to, you know, vallet my car. The king bed we upgraded to was just two small beds pushed together. Man, I love sleeping in the crack! So comfortable. Want a late checkout, no problem ... oh, wait, problem. The night person and the morning person seem to be on different pages.

Bottom line, someone needs to send their employees to a class on customer service and maybe even give them a print out of their job descriptions. Oh, hey, you know what ... that someone is you, Hotel San Carlos management. 

(Disclaimer: I might be PMSing as I write this review.) 

(Yes, that is a legit excuse.)

(For me, not the hotel staff.)Sunday. 6:20pm. Downtown following another amazing Mercury victory.  Hungry.  Group includes toddler. We'd like to walk to food but it's warm so we can't walk far.  It's sad how few options actually presented themselves.  We tried Coach and Willy's first, but as of 6:10 their kitchen was closed.  So, we were led back to Hard Rock Cafe.

I've been here several times after games and all for the same reasons.  It's close. We didn't feel like parking again. The food is ok.  Think Apple-bee's for a few bucks more.  But service unfortunately has been a regular issue.

One of the last times we were there we advised our server that we needed to be out the door in 45 minutes.  We asked what food we could order to ensure that it would be fast.  To his credit he checked in the kitchen.  After immediately ordering a sandwich and salad, the food arrived 5 minutes before we were supposed to walk out the door with no apology (and a server who hid from us for most of that time). We were 15 minutes late leaving just trying to get to-go containers and our bill.  

This time - our service was actually wonderful.  Our server was great.  Happy, conversational, refilled drinks much more than usual though the place was quite busy with post-game activity.  The problem came when she had to leave to move her car. You see, with D-Back and Merc games, parking was expensive and full so she had to park several blocks away where the gate closed promptly at 8pm, which we totally understood.  And even though we all saw her handing us off to the manager after handing us the check (she pointed to our table several times) no one came to our table.  Well, after flagging down a hostess, a bus boy and another server who all said they would look for the manager, and we did see them scurrying around looking for the manager, it took 25 minutes to find her and have her walk over to the table.  That's 25 extra minutes with a toddler who was getting tired. How much did we love that? Finally, as our waitress walked back into the building 30 minutes after she left, we were finally paying our bill and leaving the table.  She was so apologetic.   She was wonderful.  The fact that we heard from several folks there that waiting 20 minutes to FIND the manager was not out of the norm was scary. 

They have such an amazing location in the heart of the action after events.  Their food is decent enough that I'd be willing to grab something there again purely for convenience if only I knew what to expect when it came to the service.  But unfortunately - I can't.I certainly wanted to enjoy this place...who wouldn't? With Alice Cooper's name on the door and his picture everywhere, I thought it would be a hit. I am new in town so I decided to check it out one afternoon. I went on a Wednesday for lunch and sat at the bar- they boast half-priced lunch between 11-3 and have various items half off for each day of the week. Wednesday was 50% off their salads and meatloaf. I decided to go with the Bruce Lee asian chicken salad and coupled it with a nice Pear Cider. I loved looking at all the memorabilia and the bartender was super nice. My salad was disgusting, to be frank. Limp lettuce with some canned mandarin oranges thrown on top and chicken that was cooked in the worst sauce, also strewn about and finally topped with way too much sesame dressing. When the bill came, I saw that my beer was more expensive than my salad! Not worth it. Go for a beer but not a meal.Not impressed whatsoever. Everything here tasted a little off, and it was very expensive. I've been here twice and my favorite thing in Chinese restaurants is hot and sour soup. Gourmet House of Hong Kong's hot and sour soup is an abortion. The ingredients in the soup are weird looking, the shrimp are little brine shrimp looking things about the size of a pencil eraser, and the taste of the soup is really gross. It's sweet and kind of tastes like bad faucet water.

As for the main dishes, they lack taste. My Kung Pao Chicken was completely bland, and this is supposed to be a spicy dish! For Chinese food this place is pretty gross, and I'm surprised at how many people love it. I guess there is no accounting for taste, which most folks apparently don't have.Nice little joint, nice little waiter, nice little waitress If only this were what we eat out for it would be a five star review.

But we do have to consider the food do we not?

Tomato soup with basil, good flavour but to course in texture.

Meat loaf with mashed potato and mushroom gravy, Sounded good, was not good. I suspect the gravy was not made with a roux for thickening, but corn startch. It had the look and taste of a liquid clear plastic. If the potatos were real they found a batch that did a good job of playing the part of a boxed flake. The meat loaf had no discerning quality at all, so who knows if it was meat or tofu.

The iced tea was in a nice slender glass, but the flavour was of a nice tinted water. 

The cookie was very flavourful with a good amount of chips inside. 

So to say I enjoyed the food would be an untruth. Yes I will go back to try something else, just nothing with a sauce or gravy on it. 

I forgot I also got a side of beans. Again a very odd consistancy for the sauce in which they sat. Much too sugary with no other flavour.The only reason they dont get 1 star is because I understand they aren't accustomed to the heavier side of music and prolly panicked a bit when the Bad Brains came through.

that said, this place bites. 1. They blocked off half the seating, oversold the show, and then were kicking people out for standing. 2. It was a punk rock show following an AM skate competition. They were cutting people off that werent anywhere close to obliterated.  3. the bathroom situation is chaos. 4. the bouncers who usually work shows like Barry Manalow were acting like they were Hell's Angels roughing up little kids trying to mosh and in the end pissed off the band. 5. just to get into the place required every punk kid to remove every last bit of metal.  Their punk kids man.  thats a lot of studs, chains, piercings, etc. What a hassle.

Im sure its a great place to go see Celine Dion acoustic or something equally lame.  But why a place like that would book heavier stuff and then react like that is beyond me. I felt like i was in jail. Only in jail the bathtub gin is cheaper and you dont get yelled at as bad for smoking too close to a doorway.Places like this seem to have a really difficult staffing problem.  They just don't hire enough people to handle situations that can come up, and with printing and shipping it can happen a lot.  When I was there one lady was having trouble tracking a package and one employee was with her for about 15 minutes.  

I had a color print job that I tried on the self service machines but it was smudging, so the guy guy offered to do it for me behind the counter and it took him a few minutes.  Again, that caused a longer wait for others at the counter.

The next time I went straight to the counter to get my prints, and the lady was obviously stressed out.  She aligned my pdf then helped someone else, then started my print job then helped someone else, then answered the phone, then cut my prints in half.  We all just got lucky that someone didn't need anything time intensive or else the whole process would have broken down.Qdoba was recommended through a co-worker who assured me they were "just as good as Chipotle". Well, being just across Thomas and 10-15 minutes closer made it infinitely more convenient. Almost walkable, if you don't mind getting flattened by the new Light Rail whizzing by. As Stephen Wright says, "Anywhere is walking distance....if you have the time."

Well......about halfway through my fajita ranchera burrito, I'm already sadly disappointed. Taste, quality and price are all below my precious Holy Sepulchre of the Chipotle temple. 

First off, I decided to try the fajita, since it's what I get from (angels sing) Chipotle, so it would make the best comparison. I always ask for, and get, some extra peppers/onions for a perfect, albeit "Chain", burrito. So I was a little shocked by the "We'll have to charge you for that" response. 

For about 4 pieces of pepper and onion. No joke. Hard times, Qdoba??

The rice is thinner and smaller than Chipotle's, and the burrito instantly fell apart. I guess they need to send their employess to the same rolling-and-folding school that Chipotle includes in their tuition reimbursement benefits.

The final price was over $9, 2 bucks more then I pay at Chipotle for the same - no, better - food.

Sorry, Qdoba, Jeffrey doesn't want burritos with good taste, he wants burritos that taste good! (and cost less)The food is good at this place, but for drive-through orders, I have been shorted on my order about 30-40% of the time.  If you go there, double-check your order regardless of how long it takes.  It'll be correct on the screen, but wrong in the bag, and usually missing something.

On a positive note, when I indicated I had a problem on their online survey, i got immediate and meaningful response from management.  However, the problem just occurred again today.  Management has more work to do.If you're on Twitter you'll see so many different places you can follow. Its cool to because they announce deals and such that are coming soon. For instance, Coup des Tartes tweeted that they would be running the Yelp Eats menu this past Friday and Saturday. I was super excited because the night I was supposed to go there was a family emergency and I had to cancel. Anyway, once we arrived we were given the standard menu so we asked about the Yelp Eats menu, "oh yeah sure". What was brought back was not the Yelp Eats menu but some 3 course prix fix menu for $25 that didn't even have one Yelp Eats item on it. No onion tart, no lamb shank etc.. VERY disappointing and irritating. Do not call a Ferrari a Corvette, no matter how you slice it, they aren't the same thing. 

Anyway.. ended up ordering the pate and onion tart appetizers. The pate is not house made and tasted like liverwurst, the onion tart was very good. However, once we learned that there was no wine service and a (correction, not $12) $9 corkage fee, that was the nail in the coffin, we were out the door. 

At the end of the day they falsely tweeted to get customers in the door then try to pass off something that isn't. Very misleading, the classic bait and switch apparently still works.Einstein's is an okay chain.  It's not my favorite but in a pinch, it can hit the spot.  This location, however, leaves a lot to be desired.  I've stopped in multiple times due to the convenient location but I always leave disappointed.  

The food here is the standard Einstein's fare.  I'm not a real bagel fan but I have sampled a few of the breakfast sandwiches.  They were okay, nothing memorable.  I usually stop in for a coffee or a latte.

This last visit really made me mad.  I ordered a hot chai latte and ended up leaving with something else (never figured out what the drink was).  Unfortunately, I was a good ways down the road before the drink had cooled enough for me to take a sip.  Aaargh!

What really annoys me about this location is the lack of customer service.  I've found that the folks working behind the counter are rather gruff and unfriendly. On this last visit, the young lady didn't greet me and refused to look me in the eye.  It's been a similar story with my previous visits.  The store seems to stay fairly busy in the morning hours.  I don't know if this contributes to the service problem or not.  Either way, I've made my final visit.  I can get a hot drink elsewhere.I will say this may not be a fair review as a drink was spilled on me in the first 5 minutes of me arriving and it may have been 50% my kids fault. The other drink spilled on me from my other kid was 100% her fault so I may be jaded, but the waiter didn't seem kid savvy and placed the wrong order for my wife. The manager said we'd get a credit for that one so we'll see. I'd suggest not bringing kids unless they're restaurant trained.Bamboo Club Asian Bistro is a corporate chain of about 10 restaurants, most in AZ, trying to capitalize on the success of that other AZ HQ chain, PF Chang's. The formula is provide Panda Express food in an upscale "Bistro" environment, add table service and a bar, so you can charge more to ignorant Americans who love their sweet and sour pork in a CPK like atmosphere, then expand to locations and sales to eventually go public and cash out before the trend fades. Someone took me to the upscale Biltmore Shopping Center one in Phoenix. I could do better in any Chinatown.This is w/out a doubt the worst food I've had since I've been living in Phoenix.
I gave it 2 stars, because the service was great, although the constant refilling of my water was getting a bit annoying. The food is not authentic, I had the Puerto Rican combo, which none of the food on there was even worth eating, while the hubby ate some traditional Cuban food, which was traditional tasting. 

Wont be going here or recommending this place to anyone, unless they're thirsty.Ehhh... Kind of expensive for what you get. Burgers are soggy and the fries taste like they are cooked in old oil. Place is kind of dirty and parking is a nightmare.  Nothing special here, especially for the price. $10 lunch for a burger, fries and a drink. Also the dining room is pretty much standing room only for lunch. No thanks.It's better than nothing. 

If you work in the area (16th and Morton) and have a limited amount of time for lunch, or if you didn't have time to eat breakfast in the morning the Veranda Bistro is for you. You will be completely not-excited-but-not-disappointed by this exactly as expected food. 

The breakfast menu is essentially 4 ingredients (egg, meat, cheese, starch) served in several varieties. They all pretty much taste the same. One warning, the home fries are typically undercooked. The eggs have an amazing characteristic, that being the ability to crumble into a pile of bits too tiny to be picked up with a fork. I sense some breakfast fairy magic at play. 

Lunchtime is a bit better, with several sandwich options, both cold and hot. There are salads and soup, and a variety of deep fried snacks. I've eaten a few of the cold sandwiches, and they are moderately tasty. The salads are premade and sitting in a cooler, which makes for some drippy lettuce. 

Speaking of lettuce, I would love to meet the monster that's strong enough to cram THAT MUCH lettuce into one container. I'm not exaggerating when I say I pulled off enough lettuce to make two more salads of equal size. No one in this world needs that much lettuce in one sitting. 

Veranda Bistro serves a valuable purpose and is blessed with a great location. It's the only restaurant within walking distance for a few thousand people. I only wish that they tried a little harder rather than delivering exactly what I expected. Curse my low expectations!Tonight my bf and I was here the service was alright the buggers was good the fries was a bit over cookedThis place used to be well friendlier/nicer. My mom is a licensed professional for the last 30 years. Sometime's she need's emergency supplies while at work, who better to get them but her daughter that has nothing better to do. In a way I am her assistant I have been doing this since I was able to drive so 13 yrs. I used to be able to do this for her without any problem's. The new management however left me no choice but to shop somewhere else. 

The last visit was very unpleasant from the beginning and my mother was with me no less! We were not greeted or helped in any way. I asked the manager where a product was she said they got rid of it and rushed off in a hurry. We finished our shopping and went to check out, now the manager started giving my mom a hard time about not having her license. Most people have them on wall's at work, why would she carry it around w her?!?! My mother is in their system and has been for ages why give her a hard time now? The girl finally does something un-lazy and goes online to check my mom's status it took forever so yay right?! Now we're getting somewhere...wrong!! 

The girl wouldn't let me pay because I am not licensed!! At this point I am mad and it takes alot to make me mad. I ended up leaving the store they did not get any money that time and we will not be returning, they dont even carry the product we went there for to begin with but were still willing to spend $ anyway. It was clear they didnt need our sale's anymore so I will be happy somewhere else.The buses are filthy, but it's cheap. That's the only reason why I'm giving it a high rating. It's great from coming down from NAU.Normally I try to stay away from McDonalds because they are everywhere so they are where I go when there is nothing else.  I still end up eating there every year or so with travel.  This time though I was just tired and it was the closest place to eat.

I went through the drive through and got one of the chicken wraps with fries and a drink.  When I got my bag there was no ketchup!  They didn't even ask if I wanted any.  Despite no ketchup the french fries tasted better than the wrap thing I had.

I don't normally eat here so I can't comment if the blah taste of my food was typical or not, but it wasn't worth the calories.  Plus I was peeved to be without ketchup.I've been travelling to Phoenix for work and I've been looking for some good sushi and thought I found it here. The first time I came here the fish was fresh and the portions large and prices good.  Friendly staff, nice atmosphere.  What's not to like.  You know what?  i'm coming back.  That's right.  Probably the very same week.  

Well... that was a mistake.  I sat at the same bar.  Ordered the same food.  The sushi chef was different though. Every piece of Nigiri I ate made me tear up.  I'm not always a complainer (vocally) so I didn't say anything and just assumed the chef was new and learning the ropes.  Well, the next day my stomach told me otherwise. I now realize the chef was hiding bad fish with massive amounts of wasabi. 

I never went back, nor will I.  Also, I eat a ton of sushi.  I'm surprised I don't have mercury poisoning.  I say that to point out that my stomach never gets upset from even decent sushi. 

The second star is because it's a game of russian roulette here.  You might get lucky.  If you'd rather not play the game, go to Sushi Ken.  I've eaten at about 15 sushi joints around here.  That's the go-to spot.I love CPK.  I have had great experiences at the CPK in Chandler and Scottsdale.  However, this location scorned me twice.  

I always, always, always order the Tricolore Salad with the dressing on the side.  It's so good!  When I went to this location several weeks ago, I noticed that I was skimped on arugula, and a lot of it was wilted.  The salad was mostly those thick red leaves I don't like.  Last night, again, they skimped on arugula and it just didn't seem like a fresh salad.  

Keep in mind, between those two visits I had the same salad at the Chandler location and it was delicious.  Lesson learned.Total... service... breakdown!  I waited the obligatory 30 minutes on a Friday night so that my 2 boys and I could duck in for dinner (the make-your-own pizza is a kids favorite). When our buzzer buzzed, I took it up and the gentleman at the front said it must have malfunctioned.  My BS meter went to 10 as we waited for another 10 minutes for a seat.  Once seated, the waitress took a ton of time to get our order, and then for some inexplicable reason didn't enter our order until the first kids meal came out to the table - spanning at least 45 minutes from sitting to serving.  Maybe it was a bad night, I could hear constant service and kitchen screw-ups from the party of 10 behind us.  Food quality was bad on top of this... burger bun was hard, pizza dough was crusty *before* they cooked it as my son was making his pizza... the only thing they didn't screw up was my beer.    

Although the wait is comporable, I will pick Yard House at the other end of Desert Ridge next time.  I'll stick to Rock Bottom on the West side at Arrowhead, which has never let me down.Stop the singing, please.  We used to love coming here- at least once per week.  There is a server who is an opera singer and she sings quite a bit.  While I am sure she is good, it is loud, disruptive, long and just awkward.  There was a 3-4 minute period at our table where we couldn't talk because she was so loud.  Doesn't she have sidework or other tables?  Other people may like it, but I'm going to Scottsdale and Shea from now on.  I want a nice, quiet dining experience with my family.  The food is generally very good. Shame.You know, I feel kind of bad for giving this place a two star review, because I really liked our server, but as far as food goes, I can't be that generous.  They do have a great breakfast deal for super cheap, but I went the route of a half waffle with bacon, and it probably came with eggs, but I'm not so sure.  The bacon was really gross.  There's this specific type of bacon that really makes me nauseous, and Sonic has it too, but it just has a sour taste to it that makes my tummy do flip flops.  I took one bite and then left it alone after that.  The waffle looked really promising, but unfortunately it tasted like it was made from the pancake batter so it was really dense and soft, not light and crisp like Belgian Waffles should be.  What a disappointment.  I was ready to love this place and all it's kitschy decorations, but the food was just not nearly good enough.I went back 2 months ago and was not happy. The ramen was so bland and the cost did not help me keep the food down :(They food is AMAZING but the service is horrible and the place is so dirty. There were bugs crawling everywhere made us loose out appetite. I love me some Popeyes chicken but not when the place is this dirty. I've worked at a Popeyes before so I know how exhausting it can get but c'mon!!I've lived in some pretty cruddy places before but I think this one defiantly takes the gold medal for shady offices, renters, and staff.  It looks okay during the daytime and it even takes pitbulls which is why we signed the lease. The apartment they show you looks nothing like the one you re going to live in despite them charging you an arm and a leg when you move out. The walls are usually cracked (it looked like someone punched a hole into our bathroom wall) and the kitchen is older than I am. The office staff seem genuinely uncaring and can boarder on being condescending and snide. The pool isn't cleaned often and the grounds are a mess. I lived in Solara in Tempe next to crackheads before and I can honestly say I felt safer there than I did at Coronado. The staff tells you they do background checks and blah blah blah but with police roaming the grounds every night and domestic issues happening weekly I don't believe that for a minute. Just know other apartments take pitbulls and other big breeds and you dont need to put up with this place.This store had a decent selection of fabric and all the same patterns available at other JoAnn stores, but I was totally unimpressed. 

I signed up for a sewing class and the instructor was 15 minutes late. Then, she decided to change the project for the class so we ended up spending the first 30 minutes of the class buying new fabric and patterns (which could have taken longer, but thankfully there were only 2 of us enrolled in this class). The projects ended up turning out well, but it was a disappointing experience as the class was stopped promptly at the end time and I feel like I didn't get my ful allotted time. 

The store is in a strip mall of not-so-great stores, so with that taken into account, the inside of the store looks fairly well maintained. The day I was there, there were 2 teenage boys working in the store who were unable to answer my questions which is less than ideal, but I guess if that's all you can get to work in the store... 

*sigh* I'll stay in my corner of the valley to shop for fabrics. If this is your corner of the valley, head South to the SanTan location - it's great.I hate writing bad reviews, so much so that when I have a bad experience, I normally just don't write a review. 
But this was just nuts. 
Brought my whole family here tonight for my parent's anniversary dinner, 7 adults and 3 kids. I happen to work across the street from this restaurant and thought it would be good to give it a try. And it was rated so well on Yelp!!
We get here and are seated quickly thanks to our reservation.
We get waters from the nice bussers, but it ends up being about 20 minutes before someone comes around to take any drink order. Red flag numero uno. 
From then on, it's just one catastrophic circumstance after another. 
*Apparently, as we were informed later on in the night, they only had ONE chef, although they had taken at least 4 reservations that we could see for parties of 10+. 
*Also, there was no manager on duty. At all. On a weekend night, no less. 
*Our server was brand new. She was very nice, and apologetic for the disaster that was our dining experience. Which we let her know was none of her fault. How the management thought it a good idea to throw a brand new server on for large parties with no help is beyond me. 
*They were basically out of everything. If you google the menu, you will notice there is not an extensive list of options. Great, fine with us. But when four different people at our table are told that the selections they've made are out tonight (including my son's pick of MAC & CHEESE), then that's just unacceptable and further illustration of the poor management. 
Due to all of these events and the unimaginable wait time between any kind of event (30-40 minutes between ordering and receiving anything, including drinks), we were pretty irritated by the end of our meal. 
Added to that stress, the elderly table of 6 next to us was at the tale end of their similar experience, which lead them to complain quite loudly and argue at the table with a rather rude brunette server who was acting as a manager type and hearing them vent. After which, they started to ask our table if we were satisfied and having as bad a night as them. Ugh. 
I will say that at the end of our meal, after my little brother (who has been a bartender for 6 years and was FUMING) tracked down a bartender named Ruben, we were finally given an explanation (ill managed and unprepared) and apology, and were taken care of for out trouble. Ruben was very nice, and had great customer service skills. And although we were nice and smiled through the whole ordeal, I felt bad that he had to face the brunt of all the angry patrons that night, which from my count, was everyone in the restaurant. He's the reason there is an extra star in this review. 
Ugh. On advice per Ruben, I may try and muster up the gall to give this place another chance, provided on a different day and only with the server he suggested. 
But, we have all been warned...How can this place have nearly five stars?  The atmosphere is fine if you're looking for a casual, family friendly kind of restaurant.  The service was fast and cordial, but the pizza left so much to be desired.  We ordered two pizzas.  One was a thin crust "Deluxe Combo" (pictured) which was passable, but nothing to write home about.  The other was a "Pesto Bianca" with chicken added (pictured) which I almost sent back --- and I never send food back.  The crust was burnt to a non-edible char; my teeth literally could not bite into it.  The chicken (which I paid extra to have!!!) was dry beyond belief.  It had a texture that made me think it was day-old chicken tossed onto a grill to merely reheat was had previously been overdone.  I was surprised that someone in the back-of-house allowed this pizza to leave the kitchen.They have a decent selection but no one to talk to... business goes elsewhere.Not a fan.  I'm used to authentic Mexican I didn't find it here.  Moreover, the service was lackluster.  I was alone and no one greeted me for about 5 minutes.  After I was seated no one came around for another 5 minutes. The carne asada was average and I finally got a refill on my soda after I had finished my meal.  I won't be back.Surprisingly bland and tasteless, but must be popular, as it was very crowded on a Saturday lunch.  Beans are delish, tho.I had heard about this restaurant from some neighbors and certainly have passed by it many times. Finally I decided to stop by for lunch during the weekend. I arrived after the lunch rush and the place was nice and tidy. The décor, tables and booths are very outdated and the dim lighting doesn't help. I was seated in a booth by the window overlooking the outside patio and pond, nice view. 

I ordered the chicken fundido with refried beans and rice. The chicken was grilled, nice taste, but the tortilla was over cooked. The beans and rice were what you would expect. The chips and salsa were pretty good but I've had better. 

After my meal I wondered about and found the bar area, seemed nice but a little tight seating and yes they had lighting a plenty. 

Overall, not a bad experience but not so memorable either. They really need a makeover in their décor, very outdated and just reeked of old! At best 2  1/2 stars.This place has gotten so terrible.  Padding on areas are falling off the metal poles.  The toddler area is now a joke.  There used to be 30+ pads for babies to climb on, now there are 3 and they look like they were dipped in vomit.  There is also a weird unknown substance melted into the carpet in that area.  I did not enjoy the baby crawling around there.

They got rid of over half of the arcade games that used to be there.  Majority of the ones that are still there are out of order or say that they no longer give out tickets.  Even the ticket machines are broken!  They had all of 5 prizes to choose from now.  I asked the people behind the counter what happened to this place and they looked at each other and said nothing.  I asked them if they thought if the place was going to go out of business and they said they think so.

This place got two stars because kids don't see these types of things and all the kids appeared to be having fun.  I don't think we're going to go back anytime soon because I don't think its all to safe.Waited 20 min to be seated. Had terrible service and almost left. The pizza was ok and I was not much of a fan of the beer. My wife had it in Ohio and loved it but she said this BJ's was not nearly as good. Hard to find parking at this mall.this is located in what used to be a pretty happening strip mall because there was one of the only movie theaters around there.
then a new googaplex opened and the whole area kind of dwindled. 
wings are good, i attest to that. but... random shooting where a person dies and four others have to go to the hospital? not really my idea of good time.Damnit, damnit, damnit! I wanted to write a good review of this little mom and pop restaurant. On the surface it's got a lot going for it; it's quaint and sufficiently run down enough to make you think it's one of those small gems, it's gotten great reviews
In the past, it smells like a good Mexican food place should, and it's been around forever. 
Unfortunately it did not live up to expectations. I got a bean burrito with sour cream and a large horchata. The tortilla was excellent, but the beans were so cold that they didn't melt (or ever warm) the clump if cold cheese inside, leaving me with what is essentially a burrito-cicle. I came in relatively early at 11:10 so I suspect that they just were not really ready for me. The taste wasn't bad, it was just that it was too cold to really enjoy. 
As a sidenote, the horchata was so sweet that it was almost undrinkable, and had the taste and consistency of coffee creamer.
What a shame.Not sure why people actually eat here, although I do like the theme and decor.  However, the food is sub-standard.  Even eggs, which are difficult to cook badly, just aren't very good.  Greasy food in a neat atmosphere.We stopped in here for lunch when we first moved out here, and at first I was "wowed" - the interior courtyard has an excellent ambiance. It's very romantic, quaint and pretty. The positive experience ended there, however. We waited quite some time for our waiter to even acknowledge that we were sitting there. When he finally did, it seemed as though he was bothered by us more than anything else. We ordered oysters, which was a big mistake (it was like $16 for dime sized oysters - ridiculous). Clearly this restaurant does not know what a real oyster looks like or they would not have insulted two people from Louisiana like that! Our main course was okay, but again, overpriced. I had a chicken salad, and I couldn't even eat it as a proper sandwich. My husband had a burger and was not overly enthused. The fries were tasty, though! Overall I got the sense that this place was trying to cater to ritzy "ladies that lunch" but fell short. The food was too prissy for lunch time, and it was too expensive. The food wasn't even really that good as a matter of fact. We might try this place again at dinner, but not for a while.Nice House nobody home...the resort is nice enough but overcrowded, understaffed and you will over pay for everything. $25 per room/per day resort fee mandatory! $27 a night overnight valet (this is Scottsdale not LA) Over priced and mediocre food...did I mention the lack of service? Either hire more people or train the ones you have better! They lost our Thanksgiving reservation and told us they would "try to fit us in" Really!? We had the last seating at their buffett..big mistake..lobby bar has 4 people behind the bar but no one serving..this really is a self service hotel in a resort setting. Popcorn ceiling in the decent sized room with a tiny balcony which you won't use unless you smoke. As you will see those who smoke throw their butts off the balcony..The pool is gigantic but again overcrowded and understaffed. With little to no personal space and is dirty. Kids love the slide and lazy river but they hated the loud classic rock pumped out around the pool..Also this is a pet friendly hotel and we got to see a poor guy get bit and a confrontation ensue..Why, why, why?  Oh right, because it was my niece's 16th birthday and this is where she wanted to go.  The rolls were sloppy, the fish could have been fresher and the service was a little slow and inattentive.   The fish isn't cheap and there's not even a whole lot of character.  Thank god I'm not 16.Don't send your kids to any of their summer programs. My daughter (6yrs old) went and had a terrible experience, and we ended up just pulling her out. They spent the majority of their time just in a room supervised by a couple of girls just left to play with the toys there or do whatever. We weren't happy with it at all.

Giving them 2 stars just because the club itself looks nice.The sign on the outside claimed that this is a "fine dining restaurant."  I suppose it may be fine dining, if you compare it to a restaurant in Tijuana.  So, take their sign with a big grain of salt.

The chips & salsa are better than most.  The chips were fresh and hot and the salsa had a refreshing, cilantro-infused taste to it.  

The rest of the food was mushy and bland.  The waitress raised her voice from 15 feet away to ask if our food was okay.  In all, I'd only come back for the chips & salsa.This restaurant is located on the corner of Via de Ventura and Hayden, tucked away in a moderate sized strip mall. Zipps has a bunch of other locations throughout the Phoenix area, each of which with a pretty similar look and feel. The interior of the restaurant is your typical sports bar/restaurant. Televisions playing sports and a level of noise you'd come to expect from a bar. I've been to this restaurant 3 times and have had a very similar food experience each time. Two of the times were take-out and once was dine-in. I sat at a booth for the dine-in and let me say, it was less than comfortable. The wooden booth was slightly less comfortable than a park bench. The waitress had a bit of an attitude, but it seemed a little more directed to her work conditions than necesarily our table.

Over the times I've been here, I've had the Buffalo Chicken salad, the Monoco Focaccia and the Greek Chicken Salad. Their dishes are much too salty and many of the things were soggy. The Buffalo Chicken was so soggy it wilted the lettuce. The Focaccia and fries that came with it were soggy as well.

I'm sure Zipps would have been an entirely better experience had I been there with a bunch of friends, tipping back some drinks. In reality, I was there because I was hungry. Each time I've been disappointed by the food, so I would pass unless you're there to watch a sports game and tip back a few.Ok, overall I really like SGC a lot! I had a membership for over a year. I've taken friends and family there to shoot. Hell I even got to shoot a machine gun for my birthday! The place is modern, clean and a great selection. They are high priced so that is a little ding on them. 

My major issue and why I gave them a low rating is because of there customer service. I've had long waits that were not necessary. I've been ignored. I've been talked down to. Just a rude and cocky bunch of people who over all don't treat there customers well. There are a few employees that are great. But it's maybe 2 - 3 and that's it.

My major issue and what caused me to cancel my membership was how the handled a billing issue. I was double charged on my card for my monthly membership back in 2010. I called and informed them and they fixed. Great. Then in October(2011), I was double billed again. I called and spoke to Seth and he told me the same story I heard back in 2010. He was nice and said he's fix it and refund my charge on my credit card. I waited a full month and it was no corrected on my card. I went into the store and asked to speak with Seth. He came out and I explained the situation and showed him the bill. He said he wasn't sure why it didn't go through and said he'd fix it and kept a copy of my bill. I also asked him to cancel my membership and since it was only a few days after the last billing if he could refund me for November since I was canceling and not going to use it. He said sure no problem and gave me his card for when I want to reactivate my account.

I left feeling a bit annoyed that this happened twice and that after calling I still had to come down. However I felt good about Seth as he seemed to care and was going to fix the problem right away. Well that didn't happen!!!! It has been since the beginning of November since I went to the store and spoke with Seth and since the beginning of October since I called him the first time. I still have not been credited on my credit card. So since being a member, I was double charged a total of 3 times and after alerting them it was only fixed once.  Very disappointed and feel like they stole from me. Actually they did!Slowest delivery ever! Not worth itThis place is all about the 'upsell'.  Once they get you in the door with their low memberships they start pumping their 'supplements' and personal training, which is their main revenue stream.  You have to be very assertive with them and tell them to back off, otherwise they will just keep coming after you to get you to buy their products and services.  This is the most aggressive gym I have ever been to in terms of their constant and relentless upsell efforts.  It can be a real turn off.Yes, its a step above fast food, but you pay for what you get. A few months ago I had one of their dinner plates and a drink, maybe an extra taco, and it was 11-something! For a few bucks more I coulda' gone to a sit-down joint and had REAL Mexican food! The food is pretty fresh and all that, but its rather bland and boring. I do like the salsa bar, load your own and take it to go thingy. They also have nice take out cups!So the waiter brought a me cheese enchilada and chicken taco even though I ordered a beef enchilada and chicken taco I informed him of this and he looked at me in the face and asked me if I wanted a side of beef.  I will not be backNice clean store, however it is the MOST EXPENSIVE Goodwill in the Valley, and I've been to all of them.  It's not really worth making the trip from Phoenix.  Also they moved to the Southeast corner of E Palisades Blvd and N Fountain Hills Blvd.The food was what you should expect when going to Denny's but the staff just wasn't that good. I've almost never had a good waitress at Denny's before. Which granted the job does suck completely, BUT, you signed up for it so don't make everyone else's experience suck because of your incompetence. If you want Denny's then you should go. But do not expect a lovely waitress to meet your needs.I was not overly impressed.  Service was INCREDIBLY slow.  We were using a Groupon.  I would have been terribly upset without it.  Food was ok, but I think that was mostly because we were starving.  No apologies for lack of service.  No smile.  No return once food was served.  Won't be eating here again.  They automatically added 18% tip for party of 6, definitely not earned.  I normally tip minimum 20%, not here.  Not this day anyway.Let's start with what I liked: the view, and the free beer from the Yelp check in. I wish I had more, but I don't. 

The restaurant was small, bland and felt like my grandma's basement. My free beer was their citrus beer. They had a very limited selection of draft, so I tried something new. Big mistake. It tasted like they squeezed a lemon into a glass of PBR. It was the first time I ever watered down my own beer to finish it. 

Food was decent, but over priced and over fancy. The B3 Burger was decent, but at $17 (oh, you want fries with that? $3 more please for about a cup of fries.) it wasn't worth it. The rest of the party seemed to enjoy their food though. 

Service was terrible. Except the guy filling waters and cleaning plates. He was on point, and was the only saving grace. I had to order my beer twice. We had to ask for ketchup twice. Even then, the ketchup came after we all but finished our burgers and fries. 

Bottom line: if you want a drink with a view, this is your place. If you want to eat good food, go elsewhere.Lately it seems their standards have gone down. The chicken is dry when I order white meat. If im paying extra I would expect better tasting food.Service excellent.  Food not so great.I would like to ask ALL LA Fitness members male or female if they are interested in having a VOLLEYBALL LEAGUE added to any and AL LA Fitness locations to please ask their corporate offices to consider.  I am DEFINATELY interested and can find NO VBall leagues in LA fitnesses ANYWHERE!!!!
Thanks.This is a family owned and operated restaurant. We started with golden margaritas they arrived and almost tasted good but it was like drinking half water and half drink.   I didn't care for either salsa, one was smooth tomato puree that was just very hot and the other fresh tomato one was very watery and smooth with barely any flavor like the margaritas.

I ORDERED a grilled CHICKEN salad. As my luck would have it the waiter presents me with a grilled BEEF salad. I didn't say anything and just accepted it. The salad really was OK with grilled mushrooms and some onions the beef was OK but not seasoned. I was afraid to use the dressing that came with it because it was bubbling a bit.

My husband had a platter with steak, sauce, onions, fresh roasted jalapeño and cheese all melted up with rice and beans, he said it was good. 

We got good and not so good.

2.5 starsPros.
Food was fast about 2 min. Quarter pounder was cooked to order and very warm. Guy at register understood me and even helped me save a little money with my order but giving me a meal instead of ordering separate that's why I'll give 2 stars instead of one

Cons
Fries were soggy and cold. Ketchup dispenser was so dirty I didn't want to touch it. Mcnuggets were cold and way to crispy. 

I wouldn't normally chose a McDonald's but I needed fast food before I ran back across the street to the hospital to be with my girlfriend. I won't come here again while she's in the hospital.Although we visited on a Saturday evening, we arrived around six, we were seated within 10 minutes because the restaurant was not very busy.  We were taken to a table which was not yet cleaned. After waiting a while for a waiter to take our drink order finally the manager took the order.  A nearby waiter recognized that we had been sitting for a long time without drinks or a waiter.  Because of him our waiter arrived a short time later and took our order.  We would have enjoyed our mozzarella garlic bread while we waited for our entrees, but it all arrived all together. The food, with the exception of the bread, was lukewarm at best.  While several tables around us cleared out, I never saw a busboy clear the tables.  We were disappointed by the discombobulated staff and disorganization in every step of our dining experience.  I honestly doubt I will returned this location.We were in the store for over 20 mins.  Not one employee come to greet us or to ask if we needed some help.  There is just too much stuff for the size of the store.  I agree with Tracy, I feel like a rat trapped in a maze.Ehhh not the best. Came here around lunch time in a Friday and the place was not busy. The moment we walked in the employees were standing around talking to each other we were completely ignored. One employee who seemed rather busy cleaning a table came to seat us, because the other employees didn't. The menu offered many options but everything seemed the same. I finally settled for a basic burger. After receiving our food our waiter was no where to be seen. It took awhile to finally get the attention of another employee to switch out the high chair because the one I had for my daughter had a broken buckle. For a place that did not have many customers the noise level was loud not because if people talking but the annoying background music I couldn't even have a conversation with my friend. After finishing our meals an employee came up immediately to clean the table but we were still waiting on a check. Not sure I will be coming back.Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but  DO NOT get the fried catfish basket.  It was soggy and had no real texture, and the outside was completely fried.  Either they did not dry off the meat before coating it with batter or it was just a terrible frozen piece of catfish and was thawed out too long to hold any of its texture.  And they get you with a $8-$9 price tag too.  Make like a cowboy and ride off to another spot in Wickenburg.Just now getting to this review from this place I went to couple months back.  Note: Not really big fan of Fresh Mex /Tex Mex cuisine to begin with.  Anyways the last time I ate at a Chevys was years ago when I was in Cali for Happy Hour. Even then it  reminded me of frozen Mexi dinners. I ended up here  because it was the only restaurant that wasn't as busy unlike the mall food court which was full and so was other restaurant that was across this place.  

I was greeted  & seated right away but it took about 10 minutes before a server showed up at my table to take my drink order.  My drink from the bar showed up in no time, but not my waiter...where the heck was she??  The place was not busy at all, especially the tables in her area (there were 3 other tables) I waited another FIFTEEN minutes and was thinking of taking off and just paying for my drink when she showed up finally.  Well  it took another 15 minutes from when she took my order till the food was dropped on my table...literally.  Server mumbled the order plopped it on my table and dashed off pretty much.  I took a double take on what was just served and Im saying to myself, "Un effin believable, what's that on my plate??" You know picture happy me took a pic and posted it on my other social media page and even my friends commented and had the same reaction as I did.  

The presentation was the worse Ive ever seen, looked like a mish mash  of....food I guess, just thrown together at the last minute.  To be fair, it was edible and the flavors of the sherry chipotle sauce complemented the Shrimp Tomatillo dish.  Well now I remember why I avoid Chevys, the  food is nothing to write home  about and neither is the service apparently.   Thank goodness for my margarita, now that was good!  It saved that dinner experience.  No wonder why my friends that go here have drinks first.  You cant be sober eating the food here. I gave an additional star only because of the drink.Never going back, Period.

Where to start...

First - VERY ghetto and sketchy location. Don't show up / check- in after dark. Like others have mentioned... there are prostitutes that meander the parking lot. We arrived around 7pm and took the last parking space in the open outside lot. The two cars we parked in between had 4 girls smoking weed in one, and two shirtless men that were reclined all the way back in the other.  *Hrmm, somethings not right here*  

If you are checking in, just pull up to the valet area and have someone stay in the car there. The check in line was painful as there was only 1 customer rep and there were 4 people ahead of us. We were getting worried since it was taking so long and due to the people/cars we parked next to. I was praying the car wasn't getting broken into while we were waiting in line. 

The front and interior area smelled old and similar to bathroom cleaner which was replaced by the overwhelming cigarette smell as we walked further into the casino area.  We parked in the parking garage which was empty - again sketchy - and then proceeded to get lost trying to find the elevators since the front person gave us the wrong directions. 

The room was clean and didn't smell like smoke but we booked 1 king and ended up with 2 queens. We didn't fuss about it but just fyi to make sure you check if you need one or the other.

The casino tables are crap. The croupiers are not as helpful as other casinos and didn't seem to care about us having fun. I did like the slots but only for the points and how they earned in comparison to other casinos. I found one that was right in front of a bar so we were able to finally get drinks but expect a long wait if you are not close by. 

The kid zone looked odd, kinda like a big Mc Donalds play land. I don't recommend it but there were parents dropping their kids off there and at the movie theater next to it. 

The food is the only reason this place gets a 2 star.  Be advised its a LONG wait unless you are going at an odd time, and the it's still a 15 minute wait. The food was great at both the buffet and the cafe. We ordered from the cafe next door and it was AWESOME food for so cheap. We were stuffed!!  And our bill with two drinks (no booze since we brought ours from the casino) was $8. 

Oh yea and they charge you fees for internet, newspapers and the pool- which are not negotiable. What ticked us off the most though- we stayed 3 nights and only got 2 newspapers - really? You charge for the newspapers and all and don't even deliver them?!  And the pool is a little dinky pool.  I rather go somewhere else that you get what you pay for. The fee doubled our room rate which we could have paid elsewhere closer to Fremont and the strip.  We will not be going back.Seemed like a dirty Wendys

Obviously food is always good, but i didnt like the feel of this place. Next time if i have to stop here ill just use the drive thru.I love Pho, but not to Pho Kim Long...I've had better! 

I give it 2 stars for the convenience of its operating hours.I didn't like the Pho there. I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland. I also had the Bun Bo Hue. I like the side sauce that they gave but, without it, again it would taste very bland.I really WANTED to like this place! But unfortunately it just wasn't possible given our experience here... :(

EXTERIOR: 1.5 (strip mall)

INTERIOR: 4

FOOD TASTE: 5

FOOD PRICE: 2.5

FOOD QUANTITY: 2

SERVICE: -1

... So the two best things going for this restaurant are definitelty the cool looking interior (which isn't *that* amazing, but I still like it a lot) and the taste of the food which I must say is quite good...

A big downside is the prices being high for less than desirable amounts of food.

Obviously the things I was least a fan of was the service. Our waitress didn't seem to care about how pleasant our experience was. She basically ignored requests we made and even overcharged us by a little.

Conclusion? Despite the yummy spice tuna roll and teriyaki salmon, I'll skip this place next time.I like to go here to stock up on my cosmetics because of the promotions and coupons they always have, but the salon itself is a mess. 

I went in for a haircut and style since there was a promotion at that time and there were two stylists and one customer at the salon portion. One of the stylists was already working with the customer so I got stuck with the one that was sitting around. Once I told her about the promotion (I'm not even sure she knew about it), she gave off this unenthusiastic attitude about it, almost like she didn't want to cut my hair for that price. I didn't think much about it and let her wash my hair. She seated me next to the other customer who was getting some color done and I told her I needed at least 3 inches taken off because of really bad split ends and layered. While she was cutting, she tried to make small talk with me, but I felt it was a bit forced because she kept asking me random questions. I thought the cutting time was really quick, and when she was blow drying my hair, I realized she had only cut an inch of my hair! So I told her I wanted a few more inches chopped off and she gave me an annoyed look. Then the other stylist walked away from her customer and went shopping in the store, I kid you not. She came back with those nail polish strips and said she wanted to try them, and proceeded to open the package without having paid for them! How unprofessional is that? She simply said she would buy them later on her break with her employee discount...

After my stylist was done cutting my hair for the second time, I realized she had only cut another inch off my hair and I was too annoyed to sit there any longer so I just went to pay. The only good thing from this experience was the styling, but I will never come back to Ulta to get my hair cut again.This location used to be on our list of favorite restaurants, but our recent visit there leads me to say that the place has gone downhill.   The "sea-bass" was overcooked, and yet seemed like it was cooked 15 minutes earlier!  It was not what I am used to being served when I order sea-bass which is usually a thick moist cut of fish.  This was a tiny portion of thin fillets of tasteless  fish which totally seemed more of a trout than a sea-bass.  This dish cries out for some pasta on the side - all it has is basically a warm salad.  The only saving grace of the dish was the little pools of balsamic reduction - the only hint of flavor in the dish.  We also ordered the Shrimp Portofino which once was a very flavorful dish, but it lacked any semblance of sauce or flavor.  Also surprisingly disappointing is the complementary bread which used to be perfectly little loaves cooked fresh.  I believe they have replaced their fresh baked bread with ones that are baked elsewhere, reheated and brushed liberally with olive oil.  The bread now lacks the freshness and rosemary flavor of the old ones from years ago.  The calamari was very good, but the thimble of sauce was tiny compared to the size of the basket and it was very chunky making it impossible to dip.  The lobster stuffed clams appetizer was pretty awful - firstly is was severely overcooked.  I could detect neither clam nor lobster in these things which were 95% bread crumbs and celery - not a good choice for $10.  Service was below par - staff seemed to be elsewhere most of the time.Food is like all the pandas, just the service is not good, no bueno, they need to put more attentionWith 3 people working it shouldn't take this long children..... Get it together pls
We had to go back and ask for them to remake ours, it didn't stand up to the test. Once remade it was pretty good but the wait and re-do make me not want to try again.This Walgreens is just ok. The store itself is very clean and organized, the cashier are also most of the time nice and helpful. 

The pharmacy is another story. I've dealt with both walk up and drive thru and the customer service is atrocious in both areas. The drive thru is much worse, fyi. I have a script that I drop off every single month, and for the most part they have it. This medication is usually back ordered some places, so I have to come here... barf. Any who, one time I was in the DT and the pharm tech let me know my medication was not in stock, I asked if they had it in any other WGs and she said she didnt know. BUUUUT she went above and beyond for this male in the car next to mine. LAME.

Again, my medicine was out of stock and again they wouldnt call other locations, so I asked for my other script I had dropped off... they couldnt find it nor was it in their "log" they keep. 10 mins later the rude pharm tech found it and told me to come back in an hour.

Like I said, the pharmacy is hit or miss... mostly miss for me, but the store is pretty decent.

Take your scripts to an independent pharmacy like Spring Valley or to Target where theyre actually super nice!

Yay!I only care about the ice skating rink, other than, don't care about the hotel-casino. It's as ghetto as the hotel-casinos in downtown!

As for the ice arena, it's pretty awesome! Well i never ice skated in my whole life, not until my first skating experience took place in here. It's not as big as you think it would be. There are 50 cent lockers you can rent to put your stuffs in. Rental of shoes are included in the entrance fee which is $9.50 per person. And speaking of the shoes, holy moly, i think they never clean the shoes every after use, unlike when you rent bowling shoes (they spray deodorizer). They are stinky and wet! Ugh so gross! That was my only concern on my last visit. Other than that, i sure did have fun!OVERALL: The food isn't good (I explain below), but this place may still be worth locals' time (and more importantly money).  Let me explain...

There are not many "old" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an "Old Western Vegas" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers. 

FOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? 

I'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  

I ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. 

A few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. 

SERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks. 

I won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.

Service: 4 stars

Kitch: 4 stars

Food: 1 starER was less than ideal.   talked to 3 different nurses during my two hour ER stay for a fractured wrist. Discharge medication was one 5 mg oxycodone every 12 hours for a fractured wrist. I was in excruciating pain. I ended up having to go to urgent care the same day and that doctor told me that was ridiculous give me 7.5 and told me to take them every 4 to 6 hours. I called the hospital three times and they told me they could not give me anything stronger and didn't advise me otherwise.  The nurse came to give me discharge instructions and I had to remind her that I needed a splint before I left.   Then they told me to wait till the end of the week to see an orthopedic doctor to let the swelling go down.  Horrible advice, I went the next day to my orthopedist and I'm scheduled for surgery within a week.  Just all in all poor care and horrible advice.What is it with women and purses--well my wife anyway.  I finally bit the bullet and said I'd take her to Burlington today--no Coach for her.  Burlington usually has something that will fill the bill, but there's a lot of looking and looking and well you get it.  Today atypical.  Within 20 minutes, she found the perfect purse--for this year anyway. 

As usual, things in Burlington were messy.  Things were all over the place.  I guess there are so many people rummaging through that they just don't have nor take the time to replace stock the way a normal outlet would.

Then came checkout.  It's akin to enhanced interrogation.  You wonder if you're in the correct lane.  You bob and weave to move to another lane that then stops moving.  It's a nightmare.

I really would like to give the place more than 2 stars but any visit to Burlington is not OK in my book.Came here only because my friends were already booked here. Staff was alright & some of the OLDER card dealers need to  smile..jeez. If you don't like your job go somewhere else! We had to ask our room to be clean, if we didn't come back in the afternoon they would of just left it as is. You do get what you pay for..BUT would you want your customers to come back..I used to frequent this restaurant more when I was younger because I obviously dined wherever my parents wanted to go. I can't say I ever hated it, but I never returned for a couple reasons: I dislike buffets, mediocre food, and rude people. This has basically remained true of this establishment.

My parents are celebrating their 36th anniversary and my mom really wanted crab. So that is how I ended up here last Sunday night for their Seafood Dinner Buffet ($15/person).

My first thoughts upon walking in is that it's crowded, cramped, and smells old. None of the staff were particularly friendly and the patrons were rude and lacked the manners and etiquette necessary for small buffet spaces. Definitely not my happy place. 

The selections for me were minimal. I found solace in the Calamari, Spicy Chicken, White Rice, Schezwan Green Beans, Sautéed Mushrooms and vegetables picked out of other dishes. I really liked the Spicy Chicken because it had a black bean sauce, but beware, it is very spicy. The calamari was not fresh, however, I liked the large pieces and preparation. Everything else wasn't bad. I also enjoyed the Cream Cheese Wantons, but they definitely weren't as good as I remembered. I tried the Grilled Chicken, Lobster, Spicy Crab, and Crispy Shrimp, but did not like any of them. The lobster was just gross, the shrimp was non-existent in its crispy form, and the crab was just okay. Nothing tasty. My mom REALLY enjoyed the Spicy Crab and my dad and fiancé seemed to enjoy their selections (the fiancé was satisfied with Fried Noodles, Grilled Chicken, and Mushrooms - his favorite foods).

If my parents try to convince me to come here again, I may give in, but not without a few groans and complaints. But, my return is still very unlikely. There are MUCH better eateries for all foods found here that are not horribly priced when quality and taste is taken into consideration. Even if you love seafood and can't take your eyes off the extremely cheap $15 price tag, just think about your taste buds and go elsewhere!Tried the French dip @Schlotzskys and it was extremely disappointong....don't even get me started with the soup..

This place must not do much business because i'm always visiting at lunch or dinner and I'm always the ONLY customer.

This time the soup was cold and at the bottom, I said something, they brought out more but just put it in the well and still left the cold soup out. I had to pass and it's really the ONLY reason I come back.

My sandwich was barely just ok, the bread was a little undercooked and moist.-the beef was bland and chewy........and the price was outrageous!!! $35 for 3 sandwiches,2 soups and 3 drinks!!!!

I used to love this place but I guess the owner just doesn't give a shit anymore...I used to frequent this restaurant when I lived two blocks away, and while it is pretty ok with a lot of dishes (the drunken noodles, the tom yum), I've had terrible experiences here as well. 

First, multiple times I've picked up an order of squash curry to go and the eggplant was not cooked. I'm talking it was basically raw and chewy. I had to pick them out, which is not what I expect from any restaurant.

Second, they need to reevaluate their customer service. I am from a city where people aren't nice to each other and even I found the demeanor and treatment by the woman behind the counter unnecessarily snappy. 

Now that i live closer to other south east Asian food places I will not be going back.I mainly wanted to eat here so I could eat in their nice outdoor seating area.  I was upset when they had a sign up that said something along the lines of "See hostess inside for outdoor seating" and then she told us that the outdoor area was reserved for a private party.  So, they should learn to take the sign down.
The hostess stand is in an odd place.  You walk through most of the building and passed a cash register before finding it.  I've heard that the decor was "romantic," but I'd have to disagree.  It seems very outdated.  Plus, part of our booth was dusty and the mirrors (which are all over) were covered in fingerprints.
We ate early (5:00), so the service was very prompt.  Our waitress was in the process of being trained, so I gave her a break with her knowledge of the menu.  I ordered the vegetarian manicotti and my date ordered the top sirloin.  These meals can come with soup or salad.  I asked if I could get their Porta salad without ham and salami (being vegetarian) because I'm not a fan of Caeser (mainly the eggs and anchovies), and she informed me that their salads were premade, so I didn't get any.  I'm pretty surprised there's not a garden salad on the menu.  She forgot to ask what sauce I wanted, but her trainer made sure to remind her.  They both forgot to ask if my date wanted pasta or potatoes and ended up bringing out the steak with potatoes (without asking a preference).
The waitress brought out bread and was very good about explaining what was in the dip which came with it.
Our meal was brought out quickly after that.  The spinach in the manicotti had a bite (negative) to it that I haven't really had in the past with pasta.  My date's steak  was fine and the potatoes were tasty.

So, overall.  My service was very good, the decor is outdated, and the food was mediocre.
It's not incredibly vegetarian friendly for an Italian restaurant.
If you can, eat outside!

I'd probably go to Tutto before Porta Bella.  I'd definitely go to Osteria Papavero before any other Italian place in MadisonI'm not a savvy business traveler. 

At least I didn't used to be. 

I don't lift the bed skirt before going to sleep in my hotel to check for dried up puke encrusted to the bed frame. 

At least I didn't used to.

My second room was much nicer and cleaner. The breakfast buffet included a "build your own, no, actually just go ahead and cook your own - the batter pump and world's most complicated waffle iron is over there" waffle bar which I found charming.Not too keen on Taj Indian, based on one visit. Two words: scary bathrooms (you have to walk down a long hallway at the back of the building to get there - it's right out of a David Lynch movie!). Two more words: slow service. We had to practically beg a server to wait on us, and there wasn't a big crowd to justify the wait. The food was good, but I would much rather go to one of the Indian restaurants on State Street before going here again.US Airways sucks.  Unfortunately, they're often the cheapest alternative to destinations I need to go for work.  I can't believe they charge significantly more for a window or aisle seat in the front half of the plane.  Just a damn insult.  Add the unreliable schedule and you're in for a real treat.  At least they haven't crashed with me on board, yet.Prices are great but received an article of clothing back with a hole in it. There are better dry cleaning options in the area.Seriously? I order a drink and the waitress wants me 2 finish my 1st drink so she doesn't have to make my 2nd and give me a clean glass? Alrighty Then!Very bad Panda. Don't come here after 8 or the meat and broccoli will seem rotten. Always extra greasy and unsavory. Drive down to 59th if you must have it.The place was dirty with screaming children running around out of control. I cant imagine a more unrelaxing setting. The food, while there was alot of it, was mediocre at best and at 11 dollars a person, not worth it IMO. The best part was that the drink was included in the price. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.Odd that they're a Greek place yet they have ravioli, texas toast, and other Italian items.

This place does have a locals only feel.  I felt that when I was waiting to place my order while the only server chatted about her granddaughter with a local woman at a nearby booth.

Interior has a few Greek-themed pictures on the walls, but the booths date back to the 70's or so, and the chairs probably as well.  As other reviewers noted, this appears to be a sketchy part of town, so it can make one a bit uncomfortable.

Hummus was a bit gritty/lumpy, tasted a bit bland, and for some reason took a good 10 minutes or so to arrive even though the only other table in the restaurant already had their food.  Pita was dry, chewy, and tough.

Maybe next time I'll go for the texas toast and ravioli instead.If all you want is pizza, this is the place. I like the buffalo chicken pizza best and the rest of them are good too The pizza rolls aren't too shabby either. I also love the ease of the drive through and that I can place an order on my way home from work and not have to get out of my car.

That being said, the rest of the menu is way overpriced for the quality. The Italian Beef sandwich was pretty weak. It tasted like a frozen beef  that was reheated with a ridiculous amount of mozzarella cheese on it. I expected better. The same can be said of the meatball sandwich. And the marinara sauce is way too sweet for my liking.not as friendly as other places,get ob done.The Summary:
- See my review of the neighboring "Napa AutoCare Center" for more of my horror story.
- Transmission leak diagnosed as needing the leaking transmission cooler replaced.
- A seperate transmission shop said that the issue could have been mistaken for a leaking cooler, but actually was leaking from the transmission vent above the cooler.
- Basically, a misdiagnosis. I never got the transmission fixed so I gave it two stars. They could have been right, but not likely.

The Story:
Brought my 2002 VW Jetta to the neighboring Napa AutoCare Center for engine issues. Was referred here to take a look at a small transmission leak. They diagnosed the leak as needing a new transmission cooler, which would have cost $800. We decided to think on it.

Eventually ended up taking it to "State to State Transmission" on Bell Road in northern Phoenix. They said the issue could have been mistaken for a transmission cooler leak, but was actually "blurping" from the transmission vent just above the cooler lines. The guy at "State to State" said they could have been trying to replace the cooler then hitting you with a transmission rebuild, which it actually ended up needing, or they were just incompetent.Service here is unfriendly at best ( i sat in the bar)menu both lunch and regular boring .chips ok salsa served in a small caraf which makes it inconvienent  to get salsa to chip. food was ok some of the chicken in my taco was dry do to the 8 million degree oven they put it in before serving to you . this place is a true tourist/youngen scottsdale hipsters jointBad service for large parties.....great food. Went there last night for wife's b day with 6 of our friends.  Ordered drinks and bread app and cheese app. 30 min later drinks came and u was told no bread that they were out. The server the said do you want 2 cheese plates I said no...I continued to explore the menu I noticed brushetta  on the menu I was disappointed she didn't offer this option. The food took forever 45 mins to come out but was worth the wait. There were a couple more misses but all related to service.  I felt like because tip was already included we were ignored.  The kicker is the server offered to comp us a b day cake.  When the bill came we were charged. It took us 2 hours to order and eat.When I first moved here, this was the lab I used, until I just couldn't take it anymore.  I could never find a time to go when it wasn't a minimum 45-minute wait...on a good day.  Though the waiting room is large, it's often standing room only.  And waiting outside in July is not exactly a nice alternative.  

I tried going first thing in the morning, it was packed with everyone who was fasting (including me).  Tried waiting until late morning.  Same.  Tried going early afternoon.  Same.  Only now I'm really hungry, and really pissed off.  And while you're sitting for that hour waiting, look to your left. This seems to be a preferred lab for all the AHCCCS gals with two in tow and one on the way.  Now look to your right.  See all those elderly folks in wheelchairs carting oxygen tanks.  You'll be lucky to have oxygen when you're their age or a wheelchair for that matter.  Look back to your left.  That's the generation that will be funding my social security someday.

The check-in process seems overly complicated.  I had my labs sent to the wrong doctor once because rather than sending them to the physician that ordered them, they went to the last doctor I saw.  I updated my address, but they sent my bill to my old address anyway.

Now, if you can find a reasonable time to go, the techs are really good here.  Fast, friendly, and they won't miss your vein no matter how small it is.  And I have much compassion for the work they do.  At my last and final visit, the tech told me "don't take this the wrong way, but you smell so good, what are you wearing?"  Soap.  That's how bad this guy's morning was going.  Soap was a refreshing change.So boring, skip this review now. My waiter needed training in basic portions. When you ask the waiter how large the portion is of a certain dish and they respond, "large enough that 4 people should be satisfied", you tend to think that is enough for one person. Well I was so disappointed in the portion size and the blandness of my dish that I couldn't even muster an emotion. I just wanted to cry because of the outrageous price I was going to pay for such a sad meal. Sure I could have called the manager over and he would have made sure everything was taken care of and that I would be back again to give them another shot. But really, besides the name of the restaurant, I can not think of another reason to come back. 

The food was so-so. The atmosphere was like anything I would expect from a corporate concept restaurant. If you like boring corporate cookie cutter ideas... this is your place. If you like an artist with a passion, please try any thriving mom and pop. 

The macaroni and cheese is so-so. Save your money and steal some kids mac & cheese or go to Vig or Sauce. 


boring!!!!What kind of sports bar doesn't serve SLIDERS??? Nachos, quesadillas, and celery/carrots options but NO SLIDERS??? Guess that just goes hand-in-hand with the NO MALIBU RUM option!! At least the bartender asked me if their fake option was okay first. Hello... no!!!! 

Wait service was crap after a spring training game as they did not have nearly enough staff to serve people. Had to wait 15 minutes in a booth before anyone acknowledged us. BUZZ KILL!! 

On the plus side, patio is pretty cool and the pool tables when it's not a busy time!The entrance with the awesome waterfall and great looking patio had me excited for something special! It was busy and bustling so I expected a possible stellar dining experience, I mean with a full house on a Thursday evening, it's gotta be good.

It happened to be 114 outside which might explain why all three of my beers were cool... not cold. I had the snapper tacos. Fish in Arizona is always sort of a gamble, but I have had better tacos made from fish sticks. The spice was interesting but not compelling. I didn't get to choose my tortilla preference, that's okay... but the overall dish was strangely out of place and lacking any sort of excitement or originality.

Service was good, friendly and attentive. So this in no way is a negative for the staff... unless you are the head chef.It's okay. Between Olive Garden, Denny's, Friendly's and this place I'd rather eat here but the sushi is strictly eh. The atmosphere is hip enough but the music is anti-sushi techno rap. We sat at the bar and split three different kinds of rolls, all house specials. The gorilla makis aren't bad. At least they are helped by the zip of the saracha sauce. Something I HATE to see at sushi bars is the advance making of gobs of tuna rolls for quick slicing and service later. Strictly amateur and while it might be good for cranking volume it slaps the freshness imperative right in the face. Worse, in the hour that we sat there the 30 plus pre-made rolls sat on a cafeteria tray on the TOP of the sushi bar. I doubt the health department would be too thrilled about this, to say nothing of the unwitting customers who ate them later.Ugh, this place is terrible!  It looks good, and it smells good, but it unfailingly ALWAYS disappoints!  I seriously have not had one dish that tasted close to right.  Its salty and very flavorful, but somehow it just tastes off.  I've tried a lot of dishes here too.This is a two star review, so you know how's it gonna go.  But, let me start with some positives.

This was a free Hilton HHonors stay while I was in town with some people for Spring Training.  The location is a bit far from Scottsdale Stadium - only 6 miles, but 6 long and traffic lit miles on Scottsdale Drive.  The drive out to the new Salt River Fields is much, much easier.

Theres a good amount of parking, we never had any problem finding someplace close to the main entrance, especially given how busy it was.  The staff was extraordinarily friendly and easy to work with.  One slight disappointment... this is the only Hampton I've been to that didn't offer complimentary cookies every evening, but I promise I didn't dock a star off for that.

The rooms are a decent size, with a work desk, decent sized TV, and an nice bathroom, although it was all showing obvious signs of wear, but clean.  A mini-fridge and microwave are available, and while I didn't try out the in-room Wi-Fi, for AT&T customers, the 3G signal was completely fine.  5 bars, if on the slow side.  (likely from the number of guests)  There's also either a Starbucks or McDonalds nearby, because a good quality attwifi network was nearby.

The breakfast area is a bit small, so it doesn't take much to get crowded, and the food is pretty much the standard Hampton Inn breakfast - cold pastries, fruit, milk, juice, coffee, cold hard boiled eggs, a pancake station, and maybe some scrambled egg crumbs and fried breakfast potatoes.  It was adequate.

So if everything is pretty adequate, what drove down the rating?  The plumbing.  Thank God we were only at this place for two nights, but good grief... every time someone in our room or a room nearby turned on the faucet, turned on the shower, flushed a toilet, there was what sounded like someone banged hard on a drum followed by a very loud rush of water.  We all woke up multiple times during the night from the ruckus.  (We also woke up once when a guy next door, probably drunk, decided he was a pirate.  But fortunately, the staff took care of that quickly.  That's not their fault)

Maybe it was just the room we were in, but that's completely unacceptable.  Not even worth a free stay next time.Pros - 
*Pretty setting
*Nice pool
*Relaxing Atmosphere

Cons:
- Cost: there are so many great resorts in Scottsdale, it's not worth the premium to stay at this location
- Booking process: they need a better online booking tool that lists the prices for specials and packages, and can accommodate booking spa treatments and other add-ons
- Extra charges: when you're spending $350 a night, I don't want to argue at checkout about an extra $5 for this that wasn't included or $20 for that.  It's tacky.DH & I arrived around 6:30 and had reservations for 7pm, but wanted to have a drink at the bar to celebrate our anniversary, before dinner. We sat down at our table around 7, and asked for the summer menu, that was listed on the website. The waiter stated that the menu is not applicable for Saturdays. I stated that on the website it does not seem to differentiate. We proceeded to order off of the regular menu, we ordered 2 appetizers- buffalo mozzarella crostini, and tortilla soup- both were ok. For entrees we had the chicken jidori and the salmon. The chicken was moist, but lacked flavor, the salmon was ok, but really lacked any texture, the tomatoes, and gnocchi all blended together with the same texture of the salmon. We then had an ice cream sandwich, with pistachio ice cream, the ice cream did not taste like pistachio. I did not leave happy, since the food was mediocre at best.The best thing about this place was the decor. Food, service, everything else is so average. I was really expecting more. It wasn't horrible, but I won't be back.{Actual Date of Visit: 12/14/2011}

I ordered the Hot & Spicy Bean Curd.  It was ok...  I'm still annoyed by the fact that decently priced combo specials in AZ are few and far between.  When I asked to substitute the white rice for fried rice, they told me I would have to make a side-order.  What is up with that out here?  Can't you just charge me extra? I KNOW for a fact that you have a big VAT of fried rice sitting in the back...Don't front like you make it fresh per order.  Anyway, I decided on the rice bowl size.  The meal was fine, just uneventful and a really small portion for almost $7.  Next...Went to this place for the first time after seeing it on TV,  talking about how good the food is here. The food was okay, but the service was terrible. Waited 30 minutes for our food, and when I went up to the counter to ask for a To-Go box for my left over, the guy was really rude and annoyed by me asking for a box, and when I asked for a second box he said " oh! so now you want another one?", when I went back to switch out for a larger box, he rolled his eye and start talking to himself..." Just want to thank them for making it easy for me to NOT EVER WANT TO GO BACK!!!   Lesson learned---never trust the TV show! I think it was Food Channel.They're not the fastest discount, but they do the job. I just want a tire rotation most of the time but they make me wait like an hour and a half. I love the discount tires where I can get a tire rotation no questions ask in 10 minutes all free. If only this place could be the same!I really love 4 Peaks beer. Also love the Tasting Room. Therefore, 2 stars. Unfortunately, the 8th St location sucks. Would give it zero. Showed up today to do a girls night with 7 ladies. So I didn't realize it would be a bastion for soccer hooligans during the World Cup. Actually my bad, I really didn't think about it. However, when I got there ahead of time to get a table, it was only me. They said they wouldn't seat me until most of our party was there. Of course, it's 120 degrees out so... I asked where I could wait. The bar. Bummer, the bar was shoulder to shoulder. I literally couldn't even enter the doorway. So, I asked if I could grab a table to wait. Nope. I had to sit outside with the fiery sun torturing my delicate Irish skin. Want to know why they get a bad review? THERE WERE 20 OPEN TABLES AND NO ONE IN LINE. That's right. They made me sit outside in the sun instead of letting me sit at any of the numerous open tables. I promptly took our business to Casey Moore's. Never returning to Four Peaks. I don't even know if I want my beloved Kiltlifter anymore.This was my first time here and my last the manager was extremely nice, very attentive and so helpful but our waitress Liz was not she kept passing us to help a table of all guys and never came to ask us how things were until after the manager removed our plates and asked if we wanted dessert and to top it off after she gave us our check she kept coming back over and over again ... I have never been rushed to pay a check she was at our table more times to see if we were ready to pay then to ask us how things were and if we needed nothing else. The food was great and again the manager was awesome but the waitress Liz made it an unpleasant and unwelcoming experience this will definitely not be a regular Tuesday happy hour place with the bestiea lot of bands I listen to end up playing the Marquee. It's  not a horrible venue, but yeah, the parking sucks and so do the security. As if I didn't pay enough for the tickets, now I have to pay $5 to park and then get  hassled by security so they can sift through my purse and make me take my shoes off. 
Note to girls, don't take a purse and if you do don't bring in a pen as they will make you thow it away. Wearing slip on shoes is best so you don't have to hassle with your laces. 
Sometimes, but not always security gets a little weird about where you can sit and lean. I was once told I couldn't sit on the floor with my back to the wall. Why?! So if I have a bad back and standing for a few hours is making my back worse I'm not allowed to sit down. OK.Ehhh.....it was ok. Quesadilla was ok......Carne Asada burrito my daughter had was down right aweful. Queso dip was good. I doubt I'll be back. GREAT service tho, very attentive and polite waitress.Shortly after sitting down at our table, my wife and I witnessed 3 other groups leave the restaurant after they viewed the menu, without ever placing an order.  My wife suggested that we do the same, but I coaxed her into giving the place a try.  Boy, was I ever wrong!
The pizza comes in one size only, 12 inches; and they are all priced pretty 
high for a small pizza.  The waitress recommended ordering an appetizer since the pizza would not be enough food for two.  We ordered the dinner salad at a whopping $7.75, and the (small) italian sausage pizza at $15.75.  The weak instant iced tea was priced at $3.50.  If these prices seem just a little high, its because they are!
Our server was actually quite friendly, and the decor and lighting of the restaurant is easy on the eyes and very comfortable.  However, the quality of the food was just......OK.  The dinner salad was tasty but lacking in variety of ingredients for the steep $7.75 price tag. The pizza toppings were of high quality, but the sauce was pretty much non-existent.  The thin sliced sausage was alright, but not spectacular.  Wood fired pizza normally has a fairly firm thin crust, but ours was completely soggy. 
I guess we have been spoiled by pizza restaurants with much better value for the price.Mediocre food, you could do worse I suppose. Most of it is standard Chinese buffet stuff, nothing really stood out as more than generic Chinese gut fillerOK i have try-ed this place 5 times now and every time it was bland, no taste. but i think that's the way it goes in AZ, people that grew up here have no taste they just eat where and whatever is there and like it lol Cervantes on mill/southern is fresher and taste better!Woe is me. I have been coming to Pete's since I was a wee one and always got a burrito and fries. I have recently revisited and...the burritos have changed for the worse. The burritos are completely different, they now have a really crappy cheese and a whole hecka lot of beef. I never quite knew what was inside the burritos, I suspected beef, but now it is almost pure beef. The sauce is still the same, the fries are still the same, but the burritos are sheer disappointment.We ate there at the recommendation of a local. My salmon was good, nothing outstanding, but good. My husband had spaghetti and meatballs and it was terrible. It rated as one of the 3 worst spaghetti and meatballs that he has ever had and he orders it a lot when we go Italian. The meatballs were too heavily spiced with basal. I tasted it also and was glad I hadn't ordered it. He also smelled of garlic for at least 3 days. The service was good and the décor is quaint, but I would not recommend it for the food.I came to stay at the Fiesta Henderson on short notice. I picked it because I has stayed at Boulder Station and it was nice. Fiesta Henderson (a Station Hotel) was not so nice. The nicest part of the hotel is the rooms. They looked nice and were pretty comfortable, if you don't mind dust that it. There was dust on the lampshade, mirrors, tv, etc. I thank Hotel Impossible for teaching me what to look for. Next, we had to eat....Man, you wanna try a Vegas area buffet that sucks. Try this one. It was like middle school cafeteria food. Next, we went to the Fiesta Cafe (used to be Dennys), and that food was also bad. The breakfast food was pretty good. Dinner was not, service was also slow, and they hound you to get a players card every time...Clearly maintenence issues all around that as a customer I could see. Positives: wifi was not working and i called down to the front desk and got great assistance right away.  Pool was nice. Overall, if I had to I would stay there again. Its not baaaad (except for the food), but it wasn't up to par.This place is ok if you live near by.  Mostly generic brands of feed at brand name prices. So no bargains here! They claim most of their stuf is Purina off labled branding...  Besure you smell the feed, bought some rancid smelling rooster mix the other day. Also they charge extra for credit cards, which is against visa's merchant policy, so not much integrity at this place! and sometimes they charge tax on poultry feed, sometimes they put its tax exempt, so watch your receipt. They are very nice at this place, just be careful! they know what their doing...One crazy place.  The are 2 separate buildings.  Terminals A, B, C are in one... and D (United only) is wayyyy out there where a tram/trolley picks you up at the B/C section.  If you had to go from the end of C to B or A, you'll realize how long  Terminal C is.  Shopping?  Not a lot of amazing souvenir stores.  I thought there would be more.  Clang clang clang of lots of slot machines greet you everywhere.  I have to say, since there isn't much "shopping" to do, it's the only other entertainment available.  The food courts and restaurants are so-so.  

If they could increase the lighting some, maybe it wouldn't seem so dreary.Well.. I can understand a place being so run down in such an financially drained city... but... this place was pretty gross.  Huge, nasty stains on the carpeting.  The bathrooms left me feeling like I should've waited till I was on the plane (seriously) and of course... our fellow passengers were pretty run down too.  
They had super speedy and friendly security service but the signs leading you to gates pointed you back out to security..  And it wasn't an obvious mistake.. we had to walk quite a while lugging our carry ons at 5am after a long, crazy Vegas stay... purposeful confusion??? I hope not. 
We were welcomed to our gate by the blinding rising sun to seats of utter discomfort.  More huge stains on the floor.. nasty, toothless, mouth agape women... and... the worst of it... horrible LOUD music.  We had to sit at our gate for over an hour (thanks awesome speedy security) listening to this terrible stuff.   I'd rather listen to MUZAK or elevator tunes over this horrid, depressing pop-country. 

Anyway.. Thanks for hosting my Southwest flight so I could get back home McCarran..  But you should really lower your bottled water price from $4.This airline is super dirty! On my flight to Vegas, I saw a chewing gum right next to my seat, and then I saw nuts on the carpet on my flight back to LA....don't they clean it?They're strictly business, only concerned with on-time departure and arrivals. Customer service is low on their list of priorities. All their employees just feel like robots and you can see the pressure placed on them by management. They never smile and show no sign of enjoyment.

The management at this airport could learn a lot in terms of customer service, especially from airlines like Delta in the Ft. Lauderdale airport, whose employees go out of their way to assist passengers.Feel like being followed by security or puked on by a local while you shop for Advil and shampoo this is the place. Walgreens could make a few changes to control the free for all going down in there.  But, at the end of the day Advil is Advil - just don't plan to lolly gag and look around.I remember having a great experience at the Mandara Spa a few years ago so I decided to make an appointment for a massage during a recent voyage to Vegas.  Unfortunately, that experience didn't happen this time around.

My Swedish Massage was $115.00 for 50-minutes but with a 20% service charge added, it came to $138, which is not bad.  My massage therapist was great, he had me sample the different oils that they use and asked about target areas.  Although, he didn't work on those target areas longer than I had hoped, it was a nice massage.  One thing that irked me little was when he used his arms on my back, I could feel his arm hairs, which kind of felt like sand paper but no biggie, it's a guy thing.

The spa itself has significantly gone downhill.  The lounge area used to be a little more plush, with nice seating and furnishings.  Now it has three microfiber couches, a coffee table and a side table holding a huge 32" tube tv and a VCR...yes, a VCR.  Their beverage station offers lemon water, hot tea and in the mini refrigerator, there's a bunch of mini cans of juices, but no bottled water.  Apparently, they keep the water behind the counter.  Hmm...doesn't juice cost more than water??

The sink area offers your basic amenities, nothing fru-fru that's for sure.  It almost feels like the sink area at your local gym.  You know, kind of stale and industrial feeling.  The restroom area is out in the open so you can hear (and smell) everything.  The showers are in a separate room/area, which is very dimly lit, but the shower stalls are private.

The hot tub is pretty huge and can fit about 22 people, so the sign says.  But it looked quite dingy and could certainly use a good scrubbing.  The cold plunge is the size of a normal hot tub and was quite cold!  In the same area were the Sauna and Steam Room...which smelled mildewy, nothing minty or eucalyptus smelling like it should be.

The spa staff was alright, they were on the young side, just out of high-school type.  So, they were nice but, not quite refined for the atmosphere.  One of the guys who I thought was restocking the refreshment area, was actually standing there and texting until I glanced over at him.

Mandara or Paris needs to revitalize this spa because with all the other awesome hotels and super duper new awesome hotels around them, they're just going to fall way behind.This Hotel is old, dingy, and needs to be renovated ASAP!
I felt like I was in Reno , instead of Las Vegas....
The hotel has ok food options, but the rooms were the most disappointing to me. 

PLEASE update your 1990s style ZENITH tube tv to a nice sleek Samsung flat screen!!!!!!!!!!!My wife and 3 of our children decided to celebrate my birthday in Las Vegas!
We rented Four (4) rooms!
I usually try to keep up with my work using my Lap Top!
To accomplish this I must use the Internet!
The WiFi at the RIO is so slow it was impossible for me to conclude any work!
The cost of the WiFi use is included in the resort fee, of $22.00 plus tax!
But only for 1 device. Watch out if you have several phones, ipads, and computers. It is, for 1 device only!  I asked if I could use the Business office or another office and they are all the same!
I felt ripped off and will never stay at the RIO again!

Bellevue WashingtonCame here with my brother and his fiance and I really did not like this place.  We kept hearing about the stromboli, so we decided to give it a whirl.  The table where we sat had tiny puddles on it from the staff not wiping it down properly.   The person taking our order did not seem to thrilled to be serving us.  Then came the food.  I really can't put my finger on what was wrong with it, but the only thing that jumps out at me when I think about it is that I really did not like the cheese inside the stromboli.  The whole experience was unsavory.I've been getting lost and p.o.ed in this hotel since 1998.  Even stayed here once out of desparation, much to my chagrin.  All other properties in Vegas, including MGM properties, have signs clearly directing you to all the restaurants by name.  A restaurant changes, they change the sign.  But apparently Excalibur cannot be bothered.  There's just a general sign at the escalator that says "Restaurants" implying that all the restaurants are upstairs.  But they are not.  

Once you get upstairs, you'll find a couple of banners above the escalators that try to explain with oddly placed arrows where specific restaurants, registration, etc. are located.  But the banners make no sense. It's so annoying.

Also, this hotel was rundown in 1998 and is doubly so today.  It smells funny.  The smoke over the years has inflitrated every nook and cranny, making the whole place smell like a giant, nasty ashtray.

Since it is part of the weird, circuitious path that allows you to traverse the Strip in mostly air conditioned comfort, sometimes it becomes a necessity to come here.  Or if someone's band is playing here.  Over the years, I've seen more live acts here for free than anywhere on the Strip. But otherwise I try to avoid it if at all possible.Warning: if you're dining with a large group DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT eat here. Yes the food is delicious but while you're in Vegas do you really want to sit around for almost 2, yes two, full hours waiting for your entree to come? I sure as heck didn't want too. Although the waiter and manager were very nice people they were not prepared for a large group even tho we had put in reservations 2 weeks prior. The waiter kept forgetting our drinks, it took 1.5 hours for the appetizers and 2 hours for our dinner. We had a group of 16 people so they got their mandatory gratuity tip of 20%, I guess they didn't care about making us wait so long for our food.surprised that it wasn't nicer. expecting it to be on a par w/ the bellagio but it wasn't. no coffee makers in the room (what a real pain) and a very plastic feeling casino. the people that work there seemed to be unfriendly or unhappy, either way they were not that nice or accommodatingThis place is no longer was it once was. No more fun thrills and cheap food. I remember going in there it was ALWAYS crowded, even people overflowed onto the sidewalk. Their famous $2 Heinekens and $1 half pound hot dogs and shrimp coctails.. and the best of all were real dealers at the blackjack and roulette tables. It's all been replaced. Video blackjack and video roulette. Where's the fun in that? No more cheap beer or food either, just a subway and Nathan's. And worst of all it's deserted now.. it was one of the last old school feel places and now that feeling is gone!After reviewing several reviews we decided to go to dinner at Gallaghers Steakhouse and boy were we disappointed. It started with a distracted waiter who took forever to take our drinks and meal order.  A table that arrive after us actually had their order taken before ours. It was kind of surreal but with all the great reviews we thought it would be worth the wait. Well, it wasn't! Our sirloin steak was bland and rather fatty. The spinach was way too salty and disgusting. Highlights of the evening was the mashed potatoes but this does not save their rating. This was a pricey adventure and one that won't be repeated. I don't have a steakhouse recommendation for Las Vegas visitors but if you are ever in Chicago and want to taste an excellent aged steak, check out Joes Seafood, Prime Steak &Stone Crab...mmmmmmm!Let me just first say this place is pricey.  Honestly I could live with the price, if the food and service is outstanding.  The waiter was slow and really didn't give us much attention.  He acted like we didn't belong there or something.  The food coming out was incredibly slow and took forever.  I asked one of the waiters if it normally took so long and he explained to me that someone in our party ordered their steak medium well and that takes half an hour.  Since when does it take 30 minutes to cook an 8 ounce steak medium well?  I personally ordered the New York strip and it was tasty.  Unfortunately there was no pepper at our table and our waited never checked to see if we needed anything else.  I also had a baked potato with everything.  I guess everything meant make the inside of the baked potato like buttery soup because that is what I got.  I've had better baked potatoes everywhere.  I will not be returning.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the steak was good.  Btw make sure you ask what the market price is because someone ordered the surf and turf in our party and didn't ask how much it cost.  It was $125.  Not that it's too ridiculous for the size of the lobster but I recommend that you ask first.Way overpriced and rude staff.  They act like they are doing you a favor by charging you and letting you in.  Disgusting!  Olympic Gardens is much better with hotter women.Had a coupon for $10.00 off a purchase of $20 and thought we could go and have a nice dinner. The ambiance is always fun and gaudy there. Makes me giggle a bit. I honestly have not been to a Buca di Beppo for about 8 years so I was excited to go based on my memories of having family dinners there and loving the food. Well, I guess maybe I got spoiled with better Italian food along the way because today's meal wasn't really as good as I remember. Maybe, my palette has changed over the years?  We started with fried calamari (all my boyfriend's), and mozzarella garlic bread. He said the calamari was a little chewy, not as crisp as he prefers, but he finished it all. The garlic bread is always nice there, but the bread seemed to taste a bit stale at the bottom. They always sliver fresh garlic over the bread. We shared the small eggplant parmesan with a side of spaghetti and it was ok. There were two stacked pieces of eggplant parm, breaded nicely, with a good amount of cheese. The spaghetti noodles were great, they were cooked perfectly!  All in all, I guess I didn't like their marinara. It seemed too acidic to me, like they dropped some vinegar in there accidentally or something. My bf makes sunday gravy and I guess I'm spoiled by that flavor that my tastebuds changed. Buca is a nice place to get together with friends and family for family style food, but it does get expensive.After a 30-minute wait in line, we were seated. The time passed quickly for my daughter as there was a lot to look at - not so fast for me because I was hungry.

I ordered the turkey sandwich that did a number on my stomach a couple hours later. Thankfully, it was quick and painless. I'm even more thankful that the Bellagio has easily accessible bathrooms throughout their hotel.

Service was prompt and courteous. The child-friendly vibe was appreciated, but the exorbitant prices were not. Kids meals start at $9.99 and a basic burger will run $15. In my opinion, not worth the trouble when there are other options nearby.The food was terrible and the wait I pretty bad if you do not make a reservation. The pictures on the menu look nothing like the food when it comes out and it took a long time. Very pricey for terrible food. My niece di love all the animals which was good and the waiter was nice the two times we saw him, but that's about all the positives there are.5 words "i've had better and cheaper" (shrug)Yuck....dry bread, over cooked meat, no flavor. The crappiest part, somehow it added up to 20 bucks. I'm so bummed.  I had to eat it though...I was starving....I'm guessing I would have been more satisfied if I ate my $20 bucks instead.Valentines Day Dinner.  We had reservations for 8pm for 2 months.  We arrive and there is a 40 min wait, and extremely crowded, not a place to have a relaxing romantic drink before dinner. Hostesses station very chaotic. 
 Two glasses of champagne at the bar and they add an 18 % it was $48. Now we knew it would be pricey but when you get an bill for almost $900 that is a bit insane.  The food was good but really and truly nothing to brag about and nothing worth $ 165 a piece plus 18%gratuity for a sour puss waiter, $6.50 for a cup of decaf. One of the best parts of the evening was a bus boy named Jorge who could not have been sweeter, he made the evening enjoyable.  The decor was pretty and the music nice. The company of our my Valentine and our friends took out the sting of all the other things.Wasn't very I'm presses with the level of service in the store, nor the organization of employees.

Woman asks how she can help us. I tell here need to know where the calendar boards are, she says okay no problem someone will help you.. Just walk to the, and meet them in the middle of the store on the left. Huh? Should an employee meet me? Why did you ask if you could help me if your pondering me off on another employee? Why can't you just tell me where the damn boards are!! Ugh 

Sadly I should have just gone to walmart to get it. It probably would have been cheaper. Especially since my roommate just bought one there and it was 10 bucks and I just paid 12.This is a follow up review... My first visit was awesome however my second visit was a complete and utter disaster to say the least...

So was a friday night and feeling some karaoke and decided to return to Calico Jack's for a night of drinking and singing. This particular visit sucked, four hour wait to sing one song. I am NOT exagerrating when I say us two girls waited four freakin hours just to sing one song. Yes the place is packed on Friday night's but damn this was ridiculous.

Not a place for karaoke singers to go if really wanting to have multiple opportunities to sing. Is best left for those who strictly watch.

I will not be returning, the KJ's are shady, regulars have priority and go up multiple times while newbies wait wait and wait. Also they accommodate the folks who are filling their tip jar, no fat tippy no singy is what we evaluated. It's just wrong and how convenient that people walking in the door turned in song request with cash and were called up fairly quickly. We got there at 9pm, did not sing until 1:30 that is some BS! I am all about tipping the KJ after a song but not going to pay them to get called. There is also a one drink minimum and the drinks are NOT cheap.

The two fat fux running this karaoke operation for Calico Jack's need to learn some karaoke etiquette.

I am a big girl but this place is like a trailor park bbw festival, no thanks!

Never again, don't waste your time!

The two stars I gave is for their great food, yummy burgers and fries.
I have nothing against Calico Jack's as a bar, just the two KJ's they have contracted to run the karaoke. 

GO TO DINO'S INSTEAD FOR THE BEST  KARAOKE EVER-SEE MY REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My visit this time was like night and day from last time, there is no recovering from this visit, even though the first time was good.Well, its not a metairie la seafood platter but ok. The fish had freezer burn I ordered the "Sea Fest" $14.95 all you can eat. It was obvious that this platter had been frozen & shipped in. But not recently. The waitress was a lot of fun.Overrated. 

From the reviews it sounded like the perfect Birthday restaurant for my wife. It was OK at best. 

Lets start from the top.
Place from the outside was not the typical fine dining restaurant, it's in a strip mall but I knew that from other reviews so didn't count that. 

Got seated right away with reservation, received menus and then sat there for 15 mins + after we closed them and put them on the side. 

Food: The gifts from the chef were a nice touch, they were good. 
Appetizers, the Risotto was good but heavy, the parm souffle was good as well but nothing special. 

Entree: Flank steak, I love flank steak because it has nice texture and flavor, this one has flavor but a little tough on certain parts, I cut my pieces against the grain but still a little chewy. 
Lamb chops: good but a couple of pieces had a lot of fat still on it which made it more gamey, I know I could of just trimmed it but it's fine dining... The mushrooms under the lamb was over buttered. 

So overall the food was good so 4 stars, the service was bad for fine dining standards though. The place is not big so how is it that the waiter seemed to be busy. He walked passed us a few times with his head in the clouds and ignored us. There is a waiter and his help but the waiter is the one for orders, checks, etc. He was not to be found for most of the night. 

Service was cold. Right before Dessert he asks " wasn't is someone's birthday" 
Yeah from the different color napkin my wife had and the person making sure she spelled my wife's name right, I assumed they would put her name on the dessert plate. Didn't happen, he probably forgot and did it last minute with a pre-done plate. 

Overall with all the options out there not worth it.MEDIOCRE FOOD AND NOT MUCH ELSE
If we didn't have a $25 coupon, I would have probably said something. We went to the Outside Inn because it was close and it's related to Martini's, an establishment that we have had a favorable experience with.

The atmosphere is pretty standard for the "Sports Bar with a Theme" that pervades Las Vegas. That's not a bad thing at all. It's decorated with Fish and with Televisions. We were there on a Monday night and the MNF game was on so it was probably louder than it normally is, because it was loud (although not crowded, just reasonably attended.)

The menu looked decent, but the food was not very good. We got the ARTICHOKE SPINACH DIP which was actually good. It was the same kind of Artichoke Spinach dip that you find in most restaurants, but it did have some large artichoke hearts in it that were really nice. The chips they served with it were nothing special and the blue chips were quite bland.

The ONION RINGS were neutral. The portion was large and the breading was good and not too greasy. But the onions they used were very large which meant that the fluid inside the rings was very drippy. At first my girlfriend thought the liquid was grease and wouldn't eat them until I showed her it was just running from the large onions. The taste was fine but the way they were leaking they were not very enticing.

My girlfriend had a SALAD WITH SHRIMP and had some kind of tortilla chips on it. It was fine, but nothing special, that's for sure. Again, the portion was generous and the taste was fine, but that was it, it was just fine. We wouldn't order it again.

Finally, I had the SALMON ON CEDAR PLANK. BLECH! I REALLY didn't like what the cedar did to the salmon. I like things cooked over wood coals (like mesquite and the like), but this did not sit well with my tastebuds at all. It was a mixture of smoke and chemical that I just couldn't eat so I didn't eat it. My girlfriend didn't eat it either, although that's because she has never liked fish on cedar. The baked potato was good so between all the appetizers and nibbling off my girlfriend's dish, I was full.

We are members of www.Restaurant.com and had purchased a $25 gift certificate (it was an "80% off" deal on Restaurant.com and we bought the $25 which regularly sells for $10 for a sale price of $2). We had to buy $35 of food to get the $25 off which is why we had to order so much food. Had our total bill not been $10.99 (but $35.99) I would have discussed things with management about having the salmont taken off of the bill. But as it was there was enough to eat and we tipped the decent service on the original bill. 

Oh, and one last peeve: when we showed them the Restaurant.com certificate we were told there were several restrictions including that we could not order their signature Fish and Chips. First of all, that is totally bad form. It is VERY easy for them to make those stipulations clear on Restaurant.com and it's underhanded to sell a gift certificate knowing that there's caveats but not making it clear until it is redeemed. Secondly, if we had had the Fish and Chips we probably wouldn't have been so disappointed and might have had an experience where we'd come back. But Karma has a way of biting one in the ass, and that's probably what occurred here. I just hope their Karma doesn't run over my Dogma, 'cause I'd have a real hard time explaining that one to my son.

In spite of this place being almost right around the corner from our home, we will probably not go back there again. We'd much rather go to Martini's which is closer, similarly laid out but much more upscale, and not much more expensive (except on their high end entrees.)Never Coming Back.

Honestly, as sushi, it wasn't that great.  I really don't know if 1/2 of the people reviewing about this restaurant have eaten a lot of sushi before but it just wasn't that good, for the price.  I left feeling that I have had better sushi in Vegas.   This is just the food, which was about a 3 to be honest.  The real deal breaker for me was the service.

1.  Usually servers come around to ask if we need anything (at least ask if we needed more water).  We got NONE of that.  Sure they were busy, but we were in there for about an hour and got nothing besides the initial questions when we were seated.

2.  The Chefs were arrogant and rude (even though we did tip them upfront).  They didn't acknowledge our presence.  When we ordered, they rarely gave us a response and didn't know stuff was heard until it came.  Not even a nod or a grunt.  I understand work is work and they may be busy, but this is unacceptable.  

3.  My family left with a bad aftertaste.  The experience was far from enjoyable and in many ways, was very uncomfortable/awkward.  

The ambiance was mediocre, kinda  a hole in the wall, but that wasn't important.  The food was not that good as so many people on yelp hyped about and the service was borderline rude.   

SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMEWHERE BETTER.I have been to Yama a few times. I have to honestly say I was not impressed. Besides the extremely small seating areas, the food is not of a good quality. Compared to other sushi places in town i would not consider yama to even be in the top 5. The service is horrible, the wait time is horrible, and the wait for your actual food is crazy! All of the times ive gone to yama i have sat at the bar which is no faster than sitting at a table or waiting outside for that matter. Not my cup of tea.Meh... It's really dark so it makes me suspicious of the food. I remember liking this place... but perhaps I was just drunk. Went there today with some friends to eat dinner and shoot some darts. No flights on any of the darts... so bring your own. The food was too greasy, too much cumin spice and the potatoes where cold, gravy tasted like brown envelope gravy and the peas where cold. I really wish they had good food because I really like the pasties crust. The severs are nice, but the wait time for food was long. Probably not going to come here again. Going to find a better pub for pasties.I booked a 4 day rental of an intermediate size vehicle from Enterprise through Expedia.com.  The cost was stated to be $101.  Actual cost after all the extra little doo dads are tacked on was about $238.  The employees are friendly and professional, but they pressure you into taking additional insurance coverage by strongly stating that if you bring the car back with some little extra scratch from a parking lot somewhere, then they will immediately collect up front thefull  amount of your deductible and much more.  It's intimidating, but I supposed I could have said no.

In any event, I won't rent another car from them.I found this place through yelp and it seemed like it was a lot of good reviews. My first experience here was great. I got an oil change and then another time, my car locked on me so I took it there to reset it and they weren't able to do anything because I needed to replace my key.

 My third service there was due to my power steering wheels not working right. They had to deal with my Averex Warranty. My warranty decided to get a second hand parts for my car and they didn't let me know about it until after the car was given back to me. 

Well the problem with the mechanics giving me my car back is all of a sudden it's hard to back up, make a left and right turn and there's a weird sound and my car shakes from time to time. I'm putting full force just to turn and back up... 

 When I took my car in for service none of that was happening. If you're a certified mechanic they shouldn't have given me my car back knowing that its not drive able. All Randy can tell me is not to drive too much cause its unsafe... Ya think!!!  

It took me about 3 1/2 weeks just to bring my car back to this place. I got there at 11am. Two hours later after eating my lunch I asked Randy how long is it going to take? He obviously said he doesn't know because he seems to never know anything, he said its because they have to measure the power steering parts etc, which to me sounded like a bunch of bull, so I stepped away and looked outside and my car has been in the same parking spot and they never got around to my car, while I can hear and see other customers after me asking for service for their car. 

Every time, I've heard them say to other customer their car should be ready in an hr and so forth, while they never attended to my car.. I've been waiting like an idiot....

Then once they  saw me see my car in the same spot then Randy must have told one of his mechanic to finally start on my car. So I called Averex to found out what's really going on and the specialist said he never heard from Randy since the last time I brought the car in for this issue which was 3 1/2 weeks ago...  I called right in front of Randy and called him out on it and he just apologize and said he hasn't called etc. then why the hell am I waiting for this long! 

Also the last time I was at their shop I was their for over five hrs just to get my car back in the worst condition and I have a CLK Benz so that's the worst part about it. 

So the problem has not been fix and Im glad I didn't pay them my deductible because their service so far is the worst. When I ask them if someone can take me home Randy pretended he asked and then ask me how I will be able to come back for my car, geez obviously my car is at your shop, shouldn't your driver be able to pick me up and drop me off as quality service for your customers! 

When I hear his other sales person/ front guy talks to other customers he was more accommodating. Some lady ask if their drivers can take her home, they never ask her if she has a way to get back to the shop...  

It sucks because I still have to take my car back to this place I wish I can take it to a different shop.... They need to fix my freaking car and get their mechanics together, it seems to me not everyone that's a mechanic their can fix cars so watch out because you might just get an amateur mechanic, with crappy customer service.... 

Who wants to sit and wait around and get your car back in a much worst  condition! I regret coming here unfortunately I can't go anywhere else because they've already been paid for and they have to fix my car....This location is consistent with being inconsistent.

I frequent this location because it is close to my house. ONLY REASON.

I pretty much order the same thing every time:

4 piece chicken nugget happy meal, ranch for my dip, for a boy and a apple juice. 
Absolutely nothing special.

Yet, every time they forget something. One day it is the fries, next it will be his toy, some days it is the sliced apples. 

So I have to make sure I check my order every time before I leave the drive thru window.

And the inside is always dirty. Always.So, I really wanted to love this place, one because it's right by my house and two because of the reviews on it, but honestly I don't know what kind of sushi the people who wrote good reviews on this place are eating because that's definitely not what I got. I'm not sure if it's the fact that I ate there at midnight or what but everything I ordered was not good. The sushi had a bad aftertaste as well as the seaweed salad, which I normally love...(my mouth is offended the whole time..this was said by my boyfriend whilst eating)..my reaction was just as bad, I kind of wanted to throw up when I got home to make up for what I put in my stomach. I paid way, way too much for what we both consumed. I will say one thing good about the meal...the wine and green tea was great :)I'm pretty generous as far as service satisfaction, and I rarely give out one or two starts,  but I think my disappointment in their service really called for a one and a half star. 

Complete brain fart and looking to save money on dinner my family decided to go to Sedona since I had a coupon I've been trying to get rid of. Well...even the discount didn't satisfy or make up for my disappointment. 

First. We were seated to our table in which we waited an HOUR to finally get our orders taken. An HOUR! that was an all time record for me. I was on my second glass of reisling at that point. I could understand if they were busy but it was slow and pretty well staffed. Some of the staff looked distressed and lost and certainly their beige uniform and jeans did not suite the image of their restaurant. Some bussers even had their shirt untucked and pants sagging. 

We thought to get their steak and lobster special for $19.99 and their cheese fondue. Oh lordy! The cheese didn't have that nice thick consistency I like in cheese fondue and the sourdough was very dry and seemed like it's been sitting there for more than the required time that the health department would approve. The lobster was also dry and the steak was the size of half my fist and I have a very small fist. Graveyard specials at the Southpoint had bigger steaks than that. 

Second. No one apologized for the wait and no one tended to us after our disappointment in  hopes to recover from our disappointment. 

Thirdly. This is the ultimate low for them in which I have never experienced this for as long as I've been eating out. The busser didn't take out our bread plates PRIOR to bringing out our entrées so when he came out with our food he asked me to buss the table for him since his hands were full... WTF!!!!!!!!! 

The only nice thing is that the server had comped a couple of glasses of wine and a miller lite which was nice of her. They also have happy hour. 1/2 off wines on Tuesdays for bottles and by glass. Then another happy hour from 4pm-7pm and 11pm-2am. The place  is also nice and clean with that "fine dining" look they attempted to portray. 

Overall the place lacks a connection with their "high end" establishment and their operations. This place could have potential if they just improve their back end operation and maybe fine tune their staff a bit. But it seems that even after all the reviews. They don't try to reach out and somehow look into improving these qualities.Food:

We ordered 
1. GU A C A M O L E   C A S E R O
2. C O C H I N I T A   P I B I L
3. T O R T A  de  C O C H I N I T A   P I B I L
4.Q U E S O   F U N D I D O
5. P A S T E L  de  C H O C O L A T E  a la  O A X A C A

All this items were very basic without any interesting or complex flavor combinations except for the dessert.  The flavor and presentation of the food was unremarkable. I think we might have ordered the wrong stuff but there shouldn't be any wrong stuff at a good restaurant.  Also, they bring you bread instead of chips and salsa.  I don't mind the bread but it should be freshly baked bread at a James Beard nominated restaurant.  This was some store bought bread from Safeway or Fryes.

The guacamole  had cranberries not pomegranates as advertised.  It was fine but the whole guac show at the table is really unnecessary.  Plus, their show is lame.  They just mix the crap in a bowl in front of you.  They don't even have a mortal and pestle made of stone where they mash it up.  If you're going to go through the trouble of doing something like that, I want to see stoneware from an ancient mayan temple.  No theater whatsoever.

Service:

Our waiter looked like a cross between a pirate and a convict.  He had the vocal expressiveness of a mime.  When we asked about the food, he told us exactly what was written on the menu.  He was also irritated that we asked questions since it was clearly written on the menu. Corpses have more passion about what they do.  

Decor/Ambiance/Location:

Overall, the decor and ambiance of the place is simple, comfortable, and unpretentious .  The tables are covered with tablecloths and the lighting is dimly light.  You can definitely bring a date with bad skin here. There was a good Mexican band playing live music.  The bathroom has more Crucifixes and Mother Mary iconography than an Italian grandmother's house.  The restaurant is located in a neighborhood that earns the designation "barrio".   I was pleasantly surprised that my hubcaps weren't missing when I returned and was happy that nobody stabbed me. I like an adventure but next time I want to put my life on the line I will be going to Beirut not Mexican food.I have indeed been here with a friend last year and forgot to give it a rating. I had heard the big fuss about this  burger bar so i was ready for some good ol never heard of toppinigs and etc. NOW the prices are a bit much to me for a burger. While the burger was good i can think of a few places for a better cheaper burger.. IN N OUT, SmashBurger.  The drinks were good, even the shakes variety was good. Service also. BUT for the trouble it takes to get in and out of there (im a local) i have other places to get Burgers from.Disappointing.  I have been wanting to try this place since I first moved to Vegas several years ago.  If a burger is truly outstanding, then I would be OK spending $30 for it.  I know it is possible, I have had great burgers before, but this fell quite short.
Service was friendly and attentive, though they seemed to be in a hurry for us to leave, though the tables were half empty and it was midday.
I opted for the Dry Aged Angus, which was a slightly more expensive option.  I chose cheese, caramelized onions and the red wine reduction with shallots.  I was surprised to find the burger to be quite under-seasoned.  The burger itself was good, but was missing that charred beef flavor your get from a great burger.  Though it wasn't dry, it wasn't juicy, either.  I would have expected a beef mix with enough fat to have flavor and keep it from being dry.
The skinny fried were OK.I've been meaning to go this place for so long and I finally got to try it out. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by my visit. I got the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin and it wasn't good to me. I asked how the chef recommended it be cooked (rare) and I thought that it was too raw/red for me. I would not recommend getting this dish although lots of people on Yelp say to do so. The Chile Relleno was really good and the margaritas we ordered were yummy as well. Ask which drinks are popular.

Service was excellent and the atmosphere is nice.
I guess since I've been waiting to try this place for so long and after hearing about how yummy it is, I had some high expectations so when I finally got to try it out, no expectations were met and I was sad. Oh well--feels good to check this off my list though.The sides I ordered -- and YES, I ordered several of them ! ((cuban black beans, macaroni & cheese, coleslaw & potato salad)) -- were pretty good, bordering on VERY good.

The chicken, though -- not so good.  I should have gone w/the rotisserie style chicken, that was my initial thought, but I said what the heck & got "Southern Fried" instead.  My chicken was more like "Southern Grease Soaked."  It was lukewarm, it wasn't fresh, it was sitting in a puddle of grease, the skin was pretty inedible... meh.  It just didn't go over well with me.

It was delivery, not eat-in, so maybe that was part of the problem.  The order came relatively quickly after I ordered, so they get points for quick delivery, but it also leads me to believe that the food wasn't fresh/hot when they left the restaurant to bring it.

As I said, the sides were pretty good, although not very seasoned.  I wouldn't order from there again.I'm normally not much of a fan of going to see movies at mega movie-cineplexes.  That said, the 6 or 7 times I've come here, I've dropped well over $100 each time because it was for birthday parties for my kids.  Buying lots of tickets, snacks, etc.  I know movie prices rise, and I know snacks are a rip-off...everywhere but, I've been to far more impressive theaters that charged significantly less.  In comparing my experiences here, to other huge movie places, I just have to say, I've been disappointed so many times with the quality of the experience.  On more than one occasion, the sound in the movie was scratchy and had static...very annoying.  When we came to see Night at the Museum, years ago, they couldn't get the movie and sound synchronized..Really?  How can that even be?  I've NEVER experienced that before.  I've shelled out the big bucks for the IMAX and 3D movies a few times, for the kids.  We saw Spiderwick Chronicles in the IMAX and the movie literally broke down.  It just broke down!  They turned on the house lights, said sorry, here's complimentary tickets for another IMAX.  I complained to management because, I don't LIVE IN MADISON...I am hardly ever there, let alone to see IMAX.  I wanted my money back.  No.  The tickets expired after a year, we're out a pile of money, wasted all that time to organize a b-day party, drive to Madison, and yeah, they treated us pretty shabby.

So...a few years later, give them a chance again.  We go to see Red Tails - it was a decent movie.  Acting was mediocre to decent.  CGI was good.  The overall experience was average but, the staff were very friendly and service was good.  For that, I'll give them two stars, instead of one.

It will be a VERY long time, if ever, before I give these folks my hard earned cash.Oregano's came highly recommened to us. Being from New York, its hard for me to say pizza anywhere is good 
The pizza was salty I could barey eat it. My fiance and I shared a small salad which was good, typical salad ok whatever but the pizza looked like thin crust from dominos?? That being said I dont get all the raving reviews? Its typical chain food...
On a positive note our server was very sweet and attentive.Ordinary place to be very honest. They pretend like to be 5 star hotel but rooms are alright no breakfast included in your daily charges coffee is about $14 for in room dining..I would recommend near by Hampton inn or comfort inn because rooms will be similar plus you get good breakfast..oh one more thing they charge $20 per day for resort fees..you should park at east garage that's close to Hotel rooms although no one bothers to tell you that..casino is alright nothing fancy about itDuring my last visit to Vegas, I decided to try this place out. After hearing so many darn good things about this place, I truly hoped all those positive comments weren't based off the hype of Ocean's Eleven series. 

The only food that made me go back for seconds was tenderloin. Besides that, everything else were just waste of money. To be honest, I tasted better at Wicked Spoon, Rio, and Mirage.

Maybe they used to be great and somehow they are now on a downhill but from my personal experience, definitely not worth the money.It wasn't all bad. The service overall was pretty good. Bell service was poor and slow but not many are productive in Vegas. Suite was nicely furnished and had a good bed,  but it took forever to get the hotwater through the pipes in the shower. At first I thought there was no hotwater it took so long.Televisions are dated but not that big of a deal really  cause who goes to Vegas to watch TV? Casino was fun. Lobby bar was fun. Close to shopping. Buffet was ok. Stood with a couple other gentlemen who swore the Buffet was the best. I say nay! nay!  They had shift change at buffet I waited 15 minutes for chef to get replacement so it was very poor service in that regards. In room food service was quick and reasonable. Big Negative is there is no stocked fridge for convenience so if your cool with it byob and snacks. When I checked in they gave me the wrong room keys and had to get it straightened out with security. Long story but not real kosher. Elevators where quick and the overall appearance was good.Nice hotel but false advertising with the offer of wifi (part of 'resort fee'). No wifi available... Get with the times Paris.. Don't pay that fee if u come here... Get with it, Paris!pros... an okay hotel in vegas.  good location, you can get to most other places pretty easily, when traffic permits.  right across the street from game works and the big m & m store as well.  our suite was big, clean, nicely furnished and the bed was very comfortable.  all you would expect from a hotel of this price range.   

the only other good thing was the front desk clerk.  our csr was named phoung and she helped us out very quickly and was very cheerful as well.  

cons... the hotel is showing it's age.  went here when it had first opened, and it was so much more of a vegas hotel.  now it's luster has gone and it is just another hotel that just happens to be on the las vegas strip, nothing special.  it's not super bad but for the price it's not really worth it either. 

the other thing which was missing was a good place to eat, like a restaurant on the ground floor or something.  i didn't much expect to see just a sign saying, "buffet" and "diner" or something to that effect.  the food was edible but nothing special.  the one other good thing is that you can get a 2 for 1 deal on the breakfast.  

the elevators were in horrible shape.  doors all banged up and scratched, it's not so much the appearance of the doors, yeah they are elevator doors, but they didn't even close right.  if you happen to be nice and hold the door open for a straggler, the alarm would sound, and then the doors would slowly, noisily, screech their way close.  one door had a large gouge taken out of it, and was severely dented.  not once in the 4 days that i was there, did i see anyone cleaning or wiping down the elevators.  in other hotels along the strip they have whole battalions of people cleaning, dusting, moping, sweeping, and polishing anything that wasn't human.  that was not the case at this hotel. 

as for the rest of the casino, it was typical las vegas, confusing carpet patterns, every where you look, looks exactly the same so you get lost inside the casino.  the lights are perpetually muted so you don't know what time it is.  the heavy oppressive smell of smoke, you don't see the smoke but you can really smell it.  

t.v. here sucked.  my buddy's room had a poltergeist t.v. which turned on in the middle of the night and would turn off, remote would change channels and volume but wouldn't turn it off, and even the button on the actual set wouldn't turn it off.  oh and our room didn't even have the "do not disturb" door tag, or any note paper as well.    

all in all a pretty disappointing hotel to stay at.  i would expect this type of hotel off the strip, nothing fancy about the front, nothing eye catching, nothing to say, "hey look at me and come in for a good time".
in fact, this hotel should be moved out somewhere off the strip.  it's like a second class hotel charging first class prices.  not a good place.  i would rather stay next door at new york, new york then here.The Mirage is OK but this review is more about their gym, or lack thereof.

How can you have a resort hotel this size, with massive conference facilities, and have a gym that's so tiny?  The gym consists of 6 treadmills, 5 stairclimbers, and 5 cross trainers.  And 2 of the machines were broken.

And there was a line out the door.  Sooooo lame!WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.  The woman who was working at the front desk @ 3:30 AM Saturday, May 25, 2013 from Chicago, IL (that was all I could get from her name tag on account of how tired my husband and I were making the 9-hour journey to LV) - YOU DESERVE TO BE FIRED.  YOU DESERVE NOTHING BUT THE LACK OF KINDNESS/CONCERN YOU SHOW TO OTHERS.  

But let me start from the beginning: my husband and I decided to go to LV for a nice, relaxing Memorial Day weekend.  We decided to drive from San Jose, CA because our original plans fell through last minute - typically this is a 7-8 hour drive, but because of all the traffic from vacation-goers, and deciding to leave during rush hour (after my husband got off of work), our drive ended up taking over 10-hours.  Fast forward to arriving at the hotel: we arrived at 3:30 am, early Saturday morning and to say that we were exhausted is an understatement.  There were plenty of front desk personnel for so early in the morning (or late at night) and there were plenty of people checking in as well.  After waiting in line for about 10-minutes, it was our turn to check in.  We were met with a standard greeting and asked our names for the reservation.  After giving the front desk personnel our name, she proceeded to get on the phone and to check to see "if rooms were available" - even though I had called two days ahead and told them we would be arriving after 1:00 am.  At the time I called the gentleman on the phone told me there was nothing to worry about and that he would include a note on the reservation.  After the woman got off the phone, she told us the ONLY room they had available was a KING, SMOKING room.  This was TERRIBLE news being that I am EXTREMELY ALLERGIC to cigarette smoke.  Now before someone goes on to rant "why would you be in Vegas when you're allergic to cigarette smoke???" - I try my best to avoid those who are smoking and I don't gamble, so I never stay in a casino more than to just walk through... other than that my husband and I chose to drive around most of the time and we only go to Vegas for the shopping - this cuts down my exposure to offsetting my allergies (these are personal decisions we make and planning ahead like this helps tremendously for our lifestyle choices).  

Back to the story: the woman proceeded to tell us there was "absolutely nothing" she could do and did not even offer any other offer (I wouldn't have minded paying extra for the night to get us out of smoking room - but she made it seem like it wasn't even an option).  Meanwhile, the man checking in next to us was offered a SUITE when the other front desk staff told him the only room available was a smoking room - he didn't want a smoking room because he had children (totally understandable).  When I told her I was allergic to cigarette smoke, she asked to give her an exact medical condition and she would "look it up."  When I told her allergies were a health condition in-in-of-itself, she went on to say, "well I get itchy eyes too around cigarettes.  It's too bad."  THIS MADE ME SOOOO MAD.  I reminded her I called a couple nights ago and asked them to make a note - my exact words were: "I asked you guys to make sure we would be accommodated."  THEN SHE SAYS "No, not "you guys" it has nothing to do with me - you told the company and they are currently out of rooms."  SHOCK.  That's how you treat customers?  That's what you say?  Do you enjoy throwing salt on the wound?  My husband and I were so tired and she wasn't worth making a scene over... but the result?  I currently have an infection in my eye stemmed from "an allergic reaction" and my body is in hives.  Thank you Treasure Island.  Or specifically lady from Chicago, IL - since she obvious doesn't work for Treasure Island but works for herself.  

Other than that - the location of the hotel is nice.Stayed here this past weekend for 5 days/4 nights .

FYI $28 resort fee here per day and rooms were about $55 with tax 

Upon check in- no rooms available 'with my requested type' (NS King- regular room- ) so we were placed into a two queen bed room for the night. (wasnt happy about that- my BF is larger- we were pretty squooshed in that bed!)

Next day we had to try to get the 'right room' and had to stand in line at desk to do so (1/2 hour wait) and they gave us another room as they had said they would.

Usually , in all the other hotels in Vegas they would upgrade or comp you something to try to make amends that first night- They didnt- and should have- moving rooms was a pain in the butt. I spoke with the front desk staff she was very " I could give a rats ass if you stay here or not' and when I spoke with the manager on duty-even she didnt seem to care if I was unhappy or not.That fake smile was so annoying.

Its not like the entire hotel was full- it was New years Day-everyone was checking OUT. 

Take note TI from Caesars,NYNY, and even CircusCircus - who have all done that ! Ive been to Las Vegas at least 10 times...Really TI?

Room was pretty standard-nothing spectacular- but bathroom and tub were nice size.
Halls were really quiet and room was on 22nd floor with decent view.

The entrance where the check in is could use some updating- the colors are old and seventies and still a bit of that 'Pirate' flair which they look like they are moving away from.(and should - its not a daycare - its a hotel)Let me first say that this is my spot when you want to stay on the strip, but you don't wanna bust your wallet while doing so.  The place reminds me of a bigger Motel 6 with a casino that happens to be attached to it.  The staff is pretty wack and do not have a clue at what they are doing sometimes.  I had to complain twice before i finally got a room that ok.  What you get when you stay here is a prime location on the strip.  The nicer hotels that you should have stayed at are all around you and are in walking distance.  Five stars for location and -8 stars for everything else you have read.My GF had Mon Ami Gabi bookmarked; so, during this stop over in LV, we decided to give it a try.  We were looking forward to trying the Beef Wellington, but upon sitting down we soon found out that it is their Sunday special, and since it was Thursday we were SOL on that front.  Ok, no problem.  Surely there is a lot of other good stuff here to eat.  We started looking over the rather brief menu.  We decided to go with a Shrimp Cocktail, the Summer Tomato Salad, and the fish special of the day - Sea Bass.  The Shrimp Cocktail was nothing special and very over-priced: $15 for 5 shrimp on a bed of ice with a very small cocktail sauce container.  The summer tomato salad was even more disappointing: a few slices of tomatoes spread over a plate with a basil leave or two, a few very small pieces of grilled zucchini, and an almost non-existent marinade.  I can make a more impressive looking and tasting tomato salad.  I understand this is a French restaurant, and smaller portions are the nom in Europe.  I have no problem with that provided the quality of the dish makes up for it.  Mon Ami Gabi's did not.  But the real icing on this cake, and the reason for two stars instead of three, was the incredibly lousy service we received from our server, Gabriel.  From the moment we sat down, it was a lot of attitude, and a lot of waiting.  We were planning on trying a desert, but we got tired of waiting for our waiter after we finished eating, and decided to not give Mon Ami Gabi any more of our business.1 Star for location.
1 Star for not having critters running around.

The room had that funky old smell. I asked guest services to spray and/or vacuum multiple times. Either they did and it didn't help or they didn't and that obviously wouldn't help. In any case, wasn't fun staying here.

I didn't stay in one of the new and improved rooms so maybe that would have helped. I wouldn't stay here again unless it was in one of those rooms.

Obviously, if you are just going to stumble back to the room drunk and not notice a smell then this is the place for you.this place does not make me wanna walk like an egyptian. makes me want to run like a mad man to another hotel. but i guess you get what you pay for. think the room was 39 bucks. 

let me start with the rude ghetto brothers at the front desk. it was our turn to check in and we stood there like 2 minutes while the ghetto manager was joking around with the ghetto front desk guy. and then the hood rat worker next to him started chatting away with this guy in the middle of her transaction with other customers while me and my girlfriend just stood there.

so we finally get the guy to give us our room and we kindly asked if we can get a room close to the elevator. so the guy said its not that far. so we say thanks, go on our way. going up the angled elevators which makes you dizzy we're thinking how ghetto this place looks. we step out, feels like we were in a cheap motel. and the rooms were motel quality as well. and turns out we have to walk to the other corner which is pretty damn far if you were to go in and out of your hotel room. 

the only thing that kept me from giving this place a one star was they had free internet. even though it wasn't wireless.... had to pull a cord from behind the tv and plug it in my lap top. but hey, at least that worked.The AC was enough to cool off the room and it was "operating fine" the handset on the phone didn't work either.  It took 45 mins to check in, and very impersonal.  No fridge in room, staff coming in room multiple times even with do not disturb sign on door handle. 1980's carpet smells horrible. Pool side snack bar didn't open until 1130.  2 star hotel IMOOur first meal in Vegas was here, with our group of 8. Nice ambiance, the staff was pleasant, and we loved to open kitchen concept. We started with the carpaccio. Completely underwhelmed. And the meal just got more expensive and more mediocre after that...the grilled salad was disliked and sent back by two out of three diners, with the third feeling like since he didn't hate it, he'd eat it. The steaks were rated by our table as anywhere between "fine" and "not great". I had the short ribs...and thought they were okay. But not great...and by the end of the night, we left disappointed. And by the next day, we've dubbed this place the dog of our stay. Bummer.I've never tried their food, I'll admit it. 

I was just so psyched about the beer, and I kept trying glass after glass looking for a beer that would make me say "wow this is great!"

It never happened. Nothing registered as more than a "Meh" the whole night.Pure, purely sucks.  The drinks were overpriced and half of the club was roped off and outside was closed as well.I was pretty excited to go to Delux, and had been meaning to try it for some time, but I finally got around to it this last weekend.  I'd heard how great their burgers were and that if you wanted to spend a little more than the average to get a fantastic burger, that was the place to go.  

So, off we went to give it a shot.  We got there at around 6 or 6:30 on Saturday and the place was pretty busy, although there was no wait.  We were seated at the tables along the west wall.  Talk about an awkward entry onto the booth side.  The tables are so close together, there's no graceful in or out.   To the table next to me... I'm so sorry I invaded your space.  Some other reviewers have said it was loud, boy were they right.  It was quite noisy and crowded, even the servers had trouble getting around the people & I did hear 1 tray of dishes hit the ground.  

On to the ordering... 1/2 the menu is drinks.  From beers to wines, they have you covered & I appreciated the options.  Food menu is small to average, but a decent selection of items. My boyfriend & I opted to both go for the Delux Burger.  Can't go wrong with the namesake, right?  High quality beef with arugula and a blend of cheeses, onions, and bacon.  mmmmm ... bacon.  

As we waited anxiously for the tasty treats, I got nervous. I heard the woman next to me say, "I seem to be missing my bacon".  I saw her pull her burger apart, searching, and no bacon.  I was hoping it was a one time oversight and that my burger would come with bacon, as promised.  Not so.  Both my boyfriend and I were lacking our bacon.  Our server was just attentive enough to not be MIA, but if I'd waited for him to come back so that I could point out my lack of yummy pork product, I'd have been sitting another 15 minutes with food in front of me that, although lacking a bit, was fairly tasty.  

This brings me to the fries.  Everyone keeps posting how fantastic the sweet potato fries were.  Um, yeah, average at best.  We got the 1/2 and 1/2 basket and both types were limp and bland.  They were only cooked to the point of being 'just done'.  No crispiness.  It made me sad.  Oh, and I have to throw this in, when asked if we wanted desert, we politely declined & said we were all set.  Apparently, that is server code for, "No more fries for you!".  Yup, he snatched up that basket of fries without asking if we were done. 

All in all, I didn't hate it, but wow, I sure was hoping for something better.  You know, that gem of a place that you get a craving for.  Maybe it's like that blockbuster movie that you've heard so many good things about, you can't wait to see it, but it's been so built up that it winds up being a let down.  I'm not sure if it was an off night, but I'm also not sure I'll go back.We went in at the end of lunch so we could get the dinner for the lunch price. The meat selection for dinner was phenomenal. The sushi was not all that fresh. The pasta was over cooked and the sauces were flavorless.

For us this buffet is a little better than other buffets we have eaten at but not so much better for the price they charge.First off, from Christmas to New Years the price goes up to around $50 a head - almost 50% for what looks like the same food that they normally serve.  Crab legs are split in half which makes it difficult to separate the meat from the cartilage.  They're also served frozen, and when I mean frozen expect more ice crystals in your mouth than tasty meat.  FAIL.  The "Kobe" beef was served almost well done which would be sacrilege if it actually were real Kobe beef.  The Prime Rib was actually the tastiest meat I had.  I forget which piece of fish I grabbed, but it had the juiciness and consistency of cardboard so I didn't bother with any other fish.  The mussel dishes were also pretty gross - overcooked and dry.  Most of the rest that I tried was pretty average for a casino buffet, nothing that justified the Bellagio premium or the holiday ripoff rate.  I for one will never be returning.The good:  Our waiter provided excellent service and the food was very tasty.  The lobster won tons were amazing.

The bad:  After having to explain to four different bouncers that we had a reservation for dinner, we finally bypassed the queue.  Then the hostess was extremely rude explaining that there was no way she could seat anyone until the whole party was present, even the one missing party who would be on her way soon but her flight had been delayed.  So we had to agree to sit at a table minus the person who was rushing from the aiport and then instead of seating us, we had to wait at the bar for 30 minutes with one of those vibrating beepers.  I'm not sure why the hostess had such an attitude when our table wasn't ready anyway.  I seriously considered leaving when the bouncer kept flashing his flashlight and saying "you can't stand there" while we were waiting for our table that wasn't ready.  I wish I would have seen the review that you need to get a "line pass" from your waiter.  We didn't do that and even after spending over a hundred dollars each on dinner and wine, we were told by the bouncer at the top of the stairs that we couldn't get in without paying the cover.  And that even though we ate dinner at the restaurant, we would have to wait in the enormous queu in the corridor outside to pay cover.  Perhaps it was a novice move not to ask the waiter to help us get entrance but it was quite annoying at the time.  So if you go for dinner and then the nightclub, I suggest either making sure you ask your waiter for a "line pass" or saving your money to go to Mix where the food, wine (Cakebread chardonney - yummy!) and service were amazing and our waiter offered to escort us into the lounge.HOLY MOLY!  Cougars and big women unite!  I failed to see any of the beautiful people in the Vegas club scene.  The line was ridiculously long, lucky for us we had a high roller hook up.  Geez, I would have been so mad to have waited in that long ass line just to get into this sucky club.  NO THANKS!  I know it's Vegas and it's hot, but if you have multiple folds of fat on your arms, thighs, or tummy, maybe you shouldn't be wearing that supertight dress that's letting it ALL hang out.  It made me become paranoid about my caloric intake and exercise regimen.  I felt like I was in a Las Vegas Twilight Zone.  No sexy people to be seen.  Also, I was not happy with the bazillion steps to go in and get out in the tiny ass hallway!  Imagine if there was a fire, people would have been trapped.  Two of my friends were attacked by cougars caught right in the neck and paralyzed.  BUT they did get us some drinks out of it too.  Lucky me, not so lucky guys.  

The music was cool, the decor was nice.  I had to give them credit for that much.

It was worth my 25 dollars to see the guys uncomfortable while being chased by oldies with cleavage and chasing around the BIG girls.This place was seriously disappointing.

We waited for our names to be called at a table in the bar. There appeared to be only one server for the bar and she kept saying she'd be right there to take our drink order. 10-15 min. later, our name was called and we still hadn't had our drink order taken.

Our table service was better, but not by much. We waited a long time to have our order taken, and the server didn't come to check on us more than twice. 

The food was fine for the price, but it certainly doesn't stand out among the best Mexican restaurants. Seemed cheesy/gimmicky to me (it is Vegas, though!).This show was very disappointing. Having seen Mystere, O, and Zumanity, I was thinking there would be more stunts where you stare in awe that the human body is capable of doing such insane things. 

The first 2/3 of the show was boring. I even closed my eyes for a few minutes. The plot was confusing. The scenes on the sand with the animals and the finger puppets were cute. The walkways around the audience were really cool looking, and we thought there would be more performances from there. 

The show finally got good about 20 minutes towards the end when the girl started flipping her baton or whatever it was like mad. My favorite part was when a guy started running on a spinning wheel while jumping rope. He was crazy, and that was exactly what I was expecting from a Cirque show!

If you haven't seen any Cirque shows, I would see Mystere or O.So disappointing.  If this is indicative of all Cirque shows, I don't ever want to go to another one again.  I was soooo excited about this show.  But within 5 minutes of the start I was so bored.

There was only one good part that lasted about 5 minutes.  Where one of the performers was jump roping on top of a spinning wheel.  Literally.  5 good minutes.  If you enjoy Teletubbie speak, however, you may enjoy this.  Because that's how the actors speak.  

It's like a bad foreign play.  Luckily, my husband had earned enough My Vegas points for us to get free tickets to this so we didn't waste any money on it.  We got 3 row center and it was almost a disadvantage to be that close.  So don't spend extra to get really close, totally not worth it.  The CGI part was, by far, the lamest and most boring part of the entire show.  

We also go free tix to see the Jabbawockeez.  SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better than KA!  They were incredible and we laughed and danced in our seats.  Want an 1 and a 1/2 of entertainment??? Go see Jabbawockeez and skip KA!well i dont know whats up with the gb we have gone to this place at least a dozen times every visit but one time on a sunday has pretty much been average this last sunday was a hugh dis appointment. gb get your sh%$t togetherThe good: The club is BEAUTIFUL inside...it is a beautiful club

The bad:  the bouncers are JERKS and A-holes... they hold the line for all the ugly bald people that slip them money.  

The ugly:  The crowd... an older crowd... drunk... not attractive... the music was bad.  

I had free passes, thank goodness, it would suck to have paid to get in there.  We left after 30 min... and went to Lure at the Wynn... smaller lounge... better music... better looking crowd.  :-)Based on the reviews i really wanted to enjoy this place.. but geez... it was really mediocre... The place was 1/2 full and i walked up with my daughter and asked for a table for 2  the hostess said, do you have a reservation? i said no.. she said, ok.. hmmm let  me check... looked around a bit and then sat us outside..

The waiter was less than friendly, the food was not warm and relatively tasteless - i had the limon chicken...

Let me compare to a neighboring restaurant, Humble Pie, which is just on the face a basic pizza place - but the staff was super friendly,  very attentive and the food was hot and quick.
Handles down i would suggest their neighboring restaurant - menu was not has extensive but service was better and consistent.Sad to do this but this used to be a solid choice for Japanese in Vegas. Went there this weekend and I can say the food was so/so to okay. The chawan mushi was good. None of that makes up for the poor service and awkwardness from our waitress. She showed up confused, realized she was confused and literally disappeared for 5 minutes.

Other staff eventually noticed we were looking around for a while and came to ask if our waitress had appeared. Once she did return, there was no mention or apology for her disappearance, and a smooth transition back to her awkward service. It was so awkward, the last time I felt that way was at a junior high dance. I'll pass.We had lunch and drinks here when we first arrived in Vegas. The service was lack luster. The waitress obviously didn't want to be there and didn't want to serve anyone. 
The margs were terrible, pretty much it was mix with a splash of tequilla, if you drink more than one you WILL have a stomach ache. The salsa bar was pretty good, and we enjoyed getting to have all different types. 
I would skip eating here and save your money for something more delicious, maybe go to the food court instead.What a dissapointment!! I bought into the hype that the Wynn buffet would be better than the bellagio buffet but I was wrong. The selection was a lot more scare than the selection at the bellagio. 
I came for brunch for $37.99. As stated before the selection was scarce. The seafood was an assortment of salmon wellington, miso cod (which was very fishy), squid ceviche which was not seasoned very well. 
The sushi was mediocre just a selection of spicy tuna and eel. The tuna was definitely not the freshest.
My favorite was the pesto risotto and the dessert selection. the chocolate mousse was my favorite in a little shot glass. The dessert bar was beautiful and lovely to be in.


Overall, not worth $38 for brunch! Will go elsewhere in the future.I love the scenery and the food was ok, but I really do not like their dress code. My brother had to go back upstairs because he was wearing a tank top yet there are plenty of women who are wearing tank tops--he was stopped when he was about to eat his food. My family paid a lot of money to dress down and relax. This is a really bad policy! They better change it soon. I really lost my tastes and appetite after seeing that. Profiling.This is the only buffet I've been to on the Strip. As such, the first visit was amazing. I'd never had such an assortment of foods to choose from at a buffet...

The novelty has worn off. Visited this place for breakfast/lunch on a weekday, just as they were changing out the breakfast foods to lunch. It was a comp, so it's not like I was spending any of MY money, but...I still feel like it was such a waste. The food was just mediocre, nothing to call home about. The first time was great probably because of the whole "first time at a Vegas buffet" thing.

The food hasn't changed in the 8 month period between my visits here. All the same types of pastas, same desserts, same salads, same soups, same meats and cheeses. Probably will not be visiting again. Next time, I plan on stopping by Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal.Bad service. OK food. Overpriced prices (but hey, its Vegas). I like the decor but a 20 minute meal took an hour because the waitstaff was so inattentive.So, after reading all of the lovely reviews, Jamie and I tried Sushi Eye last night...and I must ask of you who loved this place: have you EVER had GREAT sushi? I mean--phenomenal sushi? because the rave reviews highly overrated this place.

We went during Happy Hour, and it was pretty empty. The wait staff was friendly and attentive...the MUSIC, however, was awful--SO not conducive to eating, ruined the ambience, and basically ticked me off--it was loud, loud techno-pop, singing about 'getting undressed' and whatnot. sorry, there's only one time of week I want to hear that, and that's on Friday nights, when I'm out dancing, thanks.

anyway, on to the food: I ordered the edamame(not as salty as it ought to have been, but passable), and the cucumber salad(actually very different--tangy and refreshing, though I wish it would have had more crab meat in it)...the MUSSELS, however, were absolutely to-die-for...probably the most delicious and satisfying thing we ordered last night--swamped in a sweet, creamy sauce, they complimented the Plum Wine well...

as for our entrees--I ordered the Spicy Scallop roll--slightly spicy, pretty good. Jamie had the RSM roll--deep fried, smothered in sauce, but still NO FLAVOR, somehow...the tuna they used in the roll was delicious with the sauce, but the actual batter was bland, as were the 'Spicy Calimari' bits...the only thing with any nuance of flavor was the sauce they came with.

now, the reason I'm being so hard on S.E is because I've tried Tokyo Lobby, over in Glendale, and let me tell you: if you want AMAZING sushi, where everything has a punch of flavor, and you can taste every ingredient, make that trek over to the West Val...it is, by far, the #1 sushi eatery in the valley, hands down.

sorry, Sushi Eye...it was edible, but that's about it.I saw Blue Man Group about 8 years ago at the Luxor (I think) and because we couldn't get tickets to the new Cirque show Zarkana at the Aria last minute, I thought it would be fun to see Blue Man again because my husband had never seen them. We heard the show was new and they were now in a new theater at the Monte Carlo. Our concierge at the Vdara got us good seats at a discount ($150 on Ticketmaster, but we got ours for $95), so we figured, "why not"? 

What a waste of time and money. It was slow. It was not funny. And many parts were just plain weird. And I normally really like weird. When I saw BlueMan before there were nonstop beats, lots of fun bits, surprises, and smart humor. Not so here. The audience seemed puzzled and often bored. Bemused might be overstating it. Some parts seemed unimaginatively recycled (the wonders of plumbing?) and even the stuff that was supposed to be about modern technology felt stale and old. 

The special effects, props, and set designs were not up to Las Vegas standards at all. While there were some cool things, they were few and far between. Much of the show seems cheaply and hastily thrown together with little continuity and less thematic structure than a street performer routine. Blowing smoke rings into the audience --WTH for? The musicians (not in Blue Man get-up and not on stage all the time) were very good and appeared to be the only people in the theater having fun. 

The worst part was as it was wrapping up into a forced "dance party", where the only fun part was all the names they used for "bootie, I asked my husband what time it was, thinking we must have been there for about 2.5 hours.  It was only 8:20 pm. The whole show lasted 85 minutes, but it felt like we had been there forever. 

Don't waste your money. Or your time. 

BTW -- I saw BlueMan group once in concert too when they toured the country with Tracy Bonham and the group Venus Hum back in like 2003 or something and it was a fantastic show.Not what I expected. Food was really dry and didn't have much seasoning. The best part about this buffet was the ice cream. Not worth the price!! The line wasn't too long for being a Saturday night.The consistency here is great.  Servers have a bit of an attitude but this place is always rocking.  I had cold coffee which was surprising.  Their fries are great and veggie burger rivals houstons.  order a greyhound.  they make it with fresh squeezed grapefruits.If you want a decent Renaissance, then this will work.  I'm a Platinum member (OK , no jokes...) so I stay at a few Marriott hotels over the years.  I chose to focus upon Marriott because I personally believe they offer consistent quality, offer a range of options (from boutique hotels to Residence Inns to full service Marriott hotels) and for their service.  Well...this hotel's service broke down...

It's a good place to stay, don't get me wrong.  And the front desk was great.  They tried to give me an upgrade.  But instead their management denied it.  So I got a little miffed and emailed the Platinum line.  They proceeded to get me the upgrade the next day (nice service, huh...), but I was out all day and didn't see the point in moving my stuff.  Then I get this 'wine and fruit' plate for my inconvenience...

OK, so I've whined enough and you're thinking "c'mon...why are you complaining'....I'll tell you why...because I trust Marriott to live up to their commitments.  I spend a lot (yes , a lot) of money yearly to stay at their hotels.  And I expect their staff to be honest with me.  Over my last 4 trips, I received no "perks".  This one, I had a "perk" or upgrade...but this Renaissance didn't offer it to me (the clerk at check-in let me know it was available and then it was denied).  As  Platinum member, Marriott offers this "perk", but it seems like it's at the hotels discretion...well to heck with them.  I don't need to stay here and if they are going to "lie to me" then why wouldn't they "lie to you".  I'm supposed to be one of their best customers (according to being a Platinum member)...guess I'm just fooling myself...

Stay here and you get a good room (as long as you don't mind the smell of Raid...which my friend reported in his room and then shortly after moved to another) and an OK location for a decent price.

Good luck!Worst. Chinese. Ever.
The service was friendly and fast, however the meal was awful.  We ordered the Beef Rice Noodles and after the first bite, it was obvious it had been cooked in old recycled oil and possibly in a wok with burnt residue.  The old dirty oil taste was so overwhelming, it took over the entire dish and we couldn't taste the dish itself.  We had two bites and left to eat elsewhere.We had our first experience with Yard House in Hawaii and it was great. This location, not so much! My wife had the French Onion Soup which she described as bland, overly thick and just so-so overall. She also had the Ahi Tuna Salad which was equally as uninspiring. My Son had the Caesar Salad which literally had two croutons and some lettuce for $6.95. The Turkey Burger was overcooked and just kind of blah. I had the BBQ Ribs which were unusually tough and barely room temp. The creamed style corn was made with fresh corn. I know because mine was soupy, way too sweet and it was full of corn silks, corn husks and little pieces of corn cob! The BBQ Beans were way over-seasoned with cilantro? Just tasted bad! A GENUINE COLOSSAL DISAPPOINTMENT!This place is way too overpriced for the quality you get. In our group of seven people, there were only two of us who enjoyed our meal - not great odds!

To start, the servers were extremely slow. Not only that, but one of the girls received her water and there was an empty sugar packet in it!! Totally classy, Raffles. It took forever to get her a new water and then it took forever to take our orders.

All of us who had eggs were unhappy - totally overcooked, no matter how you wanted them... scrambled, omelette, benedict, over-easy, we had them all. All overdone. One girl had the banana pecan waffle, which she said was good, but literally that - a waffle. As in, singular. ONE waffle. And it was at least $11, if not more.

Their saving grace(s): Awesome hash browns, thick wheat toast and 2-for-1 mimosas... at least the day we went.No one seems to like this place and now I know why. Maybe I'm giving it 2 stars because I'm a fan of their sangria. The chicken tacos are standard. My sis had the chicken skewers appetizer and said they were pretty dry.  I was there for happy hour on a Friday night and it was pretty quiet. Our bartender was nice but not super friendly. Um, I think that was my last visit to Pink Taco.Small club with a line outside and the cover is too high. There was a wait outside but when we got in the club was probably half full. I know a lot of places do this but it is definitely annoying. Music was good if you like new and old school hip hop. I'd consider this a mid to low level club now compared to the rest.The first issue is that there is only one entrance and exit.  That creates huge bottlenecks.  You are packed tight until you are back into the casino area.

The second issue is with the fact all of the concessions were cash only. There is no reason for this, inexcusable.  

Inside it is your standard small arena.  The size does mean you get good views from almost every seat.

The staff was a mixed bag.  Some were friendly and helpful, others were the opposite.Eh... okay. Not great, but not bad. The omelettes are obscenely large... that's not a compliment! LOL.We met family from out of town here to eat (since that's where they wanted to go). I've had better, it wasn't awful... but I'm not inclined to go back.

Best things I had:

1) mini carrot cake complete with cream cheese frosting, it was nicely spice and how carrot cake is supposed to be.

2) peel and eat cold shrimp and snow crab legs. The crab was sweet, the shrimp were nicely flavored. They both tasted fresh and not fishy.

3) fresh fruit the melon, strawberries and pineapple were all juicy and flavorful.

Mediocre things:
1) steamed veggies....they were a little on the soggy side.

2) tiramisu cup, there was hardly any lady finger in it :( that's the best part!

3) cappuccino mouse, very rich....but a lot of clear brownish fluid was in a pocket in it....not sure if it just wasn't mixed good or what?

4) black beans, they're kind of hard to screw up :)

Could have been okay but.....

1) Chili Relleno. The cheese filling was good, but there was wayyyyy too much breading on it which did nothing but retain too much grease....if there would have been less breading and not as greasy this would have fallen in the category above.

2)peanut butter cream puff. Dry, kind of defeats a "cream" puff.

Yuck:

1) crab salad....I don't know if it was imitation crab meat, or old crab... but this was fish and gross...the crab was also rubbery.

2) California roll, ewww gross. I actually spit this out into my napkin. It was so fishy it made me gag a little before I spit it out!

3) mac n cheese pretty bland and gooey....I think maybe they made it with generic velveta?

So, that's the run down of what I ate, about all I could fit in my tummy. So, in my opinion stick to the peel and eat shrimp and crab :) Not sure about the other meats because I don't eat it.....my hubby said they were okay, not the best, not the worst. He pretty much agrees with me on the "Meh. I've experienced better"Got the meatloaf which was good and had a kick to it.  Since it was a "hotel" restaurant, it was overly priced.  Also waited about 15 minutes to be seated.OMG WORST SERVICE EVER.
took a cab out from the strip bc of the great reviews.. should have just ate the noodle bar in caesars.  
ordered a tremendous amount from the menu...i expected more dim sum for dinner but they only had a few selections and the ones we chose were out... 
had chicken feet... i didnt eat but heard it was amazing.
fried rice was dry.
the dimsum we did have was good though..
chinese broccoli..i personally dont like so i cant really review it..
IMO, dont waste your time unless youre already tehreThe food was very mediocre. Ordered the country style fried chicken, and it was dry and hard as a rock. The side dishes are pretty decent. Oddly, draft beers are served in plastic cups in the dining room -- seemed like a very undignified way to enjoy a Blue Moon ale! The menu featured pitchers of beer for $15, however they said that they weren't available, but you could purchase a "tube" of beer for $25 (heard this story repeated at several tables making the same "mistake" as us). Servers were also a little absent considering how empty the place was for lunch.If I grew up in Phoenix I would probably think this is a pretty amazing place.  However, growing up in the PNW and then living in Mass. for a while I believe true seafood should be from the sea to your plate in a day or less.  Went 3 times.  The last trip I had a shrimp cocktail starter (good), sole (average), and tried someones scallop (good).  However, one of these left me sick all night.  Guess that's what you get eating seafood at a place where should refrigeration fail for even a moment your fish is exposed to 120 F desert heat.  McCormick & Schmick's is a much better choice.SERVICE IS A MUST! 

Immediately, my expectations were high thanks to Man v. Perhaps too high. After arriving with a party of 7, me and the crew realized that we should have sat separately as it took nearly 15 minutes for someone to happen by and take our drink order. One of the members of our group was unsure of his order so we asked the server to take the rest of them and put them in. She took the orders and never placed them instead she waited another 15 minutes and finally took my friends order and placed it with ours. After the third trip to the table it was impossible to find he again. We confronted the manager and he said he would take care of it. Which apparently meant she was going to complain to us about our issues with her services. She finally came back to the table and said "So, you told my manager your not happy with my services?" awkward...and yes that is what she said. No apology, no attempt to make it better, no refills and the service got worse. Service is a BIG part of going out for me. The food can be terrible but if the service is great I just may go back. If you have the BEST food in the world and the service is lousy I will not go back. As for this place I will NOT be going back! 

As for the food... well, it was okay but it was hard to get past the server. Give it a shot and hopefully, your experience with the staff is more pleasant.Not impressed....our lukewarm food did not get served at the same time, my dining partner got his food served five minutes after mine. I noticed a table of six next to us who got the same treatment, two of them got served while the other four waited a full five minutes before getting served. If that kind of shotgun approach to service doesn't bother you, then go for it! Very loud head banging music, too...even at 8 am.We came here on a Thursday afternoon and wanted to stay within the Groupon (10 for 20) budget and ordered the spicy noodle soup and beef fried rice for 3 more.

- Difficult to find. Near Lotus of Siam. In the back. Get confused with the other KBBQs then finally stumble here. haha
- Considering that the majority of the food is more than $10, this was a very weak groupon deal. Limited to just the back page, labeled Chinese. LOL. 
- Horrible service. Old korean lady didn't speak to us once. Just nods. Grinch face. I would want my customers to be happy if they were in my restaurant. Same with her daughter. They didn't bother to check up on us at all. Not even to ask how things tasted, water refills, napkins! Come'on. Spicy hot soup with just one napkin? Fail. 
- Living in Garden Grove, home of great KBBQ and banchan, this place was way over priced. ~22 AYCE! HA! I know that this is not OC and I haven't tried it myself, but just by impression it seems like they're trying to take advantage of their patrons. I guess it must be a plus since I saw some Koreans eating here. 
- Beef fried rice, I don't remember the actual name, was disgusting, The beef was so chewy I couldn't even swallow some of the bigger pieces. 
- Average size bowl of soup. Tolerable spice. Nothing to complain too much about. 
- 5 korean side dishes. Kimchi was yummy. Other sides were tasted like HMART, not bad but not special. 
- If you don't know any better and craving KBBQ, go knock yourself out here! This groupon deal stinks. I honestly felt that the deal crippled their business. Smile at least! Tis the season sheesh!I didn't know this place was also a restaurant so I can't review the food.  The decor is really cool in here I must admit that (hence the reason for the extra star).  What I don't like about this club (where should I begin is more like it):  They let in too many effin' people in this place.  I don't appreciate getting crushed like a sardine or getting dry humped by random strangers on the dance floor.  Just say no to STD's OK?  I'm pretty sure the amount of people on the dance floor violated fire codes.  I couldn't even move for a good ten minutes cuz I was either getting pushed by people trying to get on the dancefloor, people decided to walk by me cuz for some reason there was no other space for them to walk past, or people bumped into me cuz they were trying to dance.  Not my idea of a good time.  The only time I put up with that noise is when I'm seeing my favourite band in the entire world.

I'm sure if you're a girl, you can get in no matter what you're wearing.  Sucks if you're a guy though.  Also some friends we were trying to meet somehow got invited to get on the VIP list but then later they asked them how they got on the list.  We got attitude from a bouncer saying "You can't bring in a shopping (plastic) bag to the club."  OK, well we went shopping before going to your place.  Luckily, my friends had very large purses so they got creative and shoved the bag in that.  Shoot us.  There's no such thing as coat check here I guess.  They really oughta invest in one of those, it's good for business.  

I'm not a fan of hip hop clubs to begin with, but seriously 30 minutes of a SexyBack mash up filled in with clips of various other top 40 of course?  I like a little more variety.  Last time I checked this was Vegas...play something a little more hip.  I went to a club in my boring suburban town that played similar stuff...I guess DJ AM was at this club too perhaps?  I'm sure this place is tons of fun if you arrive early and leave early, but if you get here around midnight or later, forgetaboutit.  No room to dance.  No room to walk.  Get me to the bar for some water please.  Confusing "EXIT" signs too.  I had to ask five different staff members how to get out of this joint and I ended up back where I started.  Cover was also $20 which I guess is "reasonable" by Vegas standards.  I couldn't even enjoy the cool decor in here because I just wanted to get the eff out of there.  Not my idea of a good time.  I'd rather go shopping here or stay in the hotel.  No club for this party pooper.I am comparing this to my experiences while staying on the Strip...

Normally, I book my stay at the Cosmo, but this trip, I decided to stay downtown since my parents are staying at the Cal.

Whenever I ask a strip casino a question using their online inquiry via their website, I have always received a response.  Always.

I asked Main Street Casino a question and never get a response.  Poor customer service.  I even left a voice mail for the casino host.  No call back. 

Safe to say, I did not and will never stay here or patronize this establishment with my gambling $$.After a long day of conventioning and a long night of walking walking walking through downtown, we decided we needed some dessert and unfortunately, the ice cream shop in the California was already closed.  Darn it.   We decided to head over to the Triple 7 inside of the Main Street Station because the word was they had dessert.  

When we arrived the hostess seemed put out by our party of 10 and said she would have to look for a table.  We glanced to our left and saw a long table with 12 seats and asked if we could sit there.  She said we could but if there were ten of us we'd have to all be on one check.  It seriously felt like she wanted us to leave.  We sat.

A server finally came by and got our drink orders and then after a while another server came by and told us she was back from break and could take our food orders.... drinks had yet to arrive.  I was very thirsty and asked if I could get a glass of water (which I had already ordered).  She told me the other server was placing that order. Soon after, the drinks did get delivered by server number two, however she started at the opposite end from me even though I was the one who asked.

A little longer wait and then the food arrived.  I had decided to get mozzarella sticks instead of dessert as nothing on the dessert menu sounded like all that.  When she delivered mine, I realized there were no set ups on the table, so I asked if I could get some napkins.  The server told me she'd get us silverware once she was done delivering food.  She finished delivering, went and got silverware and passed out one roll to each person... me last.  Then she walked away and came back with extra napkins which she dropped off at the other end of the table.  I was totally feeling invisible.

The mozarrella sticks were not that great.  hard and rubbery instead of melty and I shared them...  when I aksed for the bill, she dropped it off at the other end of the table, too.  So bizarre.

Overall, I had a good time with good company, but that was despite the service.This place is a dump...the "lobby" as you can see from the lack of photos is non existent and the hallways are bare and stink from the disinfectant that they spray all over the place.  This pool is populated with all the young tatoo'ed crowd, with backward baseball caps.  The bedroom is fine, nothing special, and the bathroom is super 8 special.  this place is so far from a 4 star that Priceline is not ever to be trusted again.  This place is one block from Pawn Shop capital of Phoenix, and other similar low class businesses...you won't want to take a walk at night around this place....the only good thing about this place was the great Mexican restaurant that is on the first floor...original Sonoran recipes that are great for breakfast or lunch.  We were in town for a wedding and thought we would stay near the Biltmore where the activities were centered.  While only a 10 minute drive it was an embarrassment to invite anyone over for a drink.  College kids on spring break love it, and families with loads of little kids they can put on the floor of their single bed room just loved it.  Their staff was pleasant and helpful, so don't take this condemnation as any reflection on them---but these rating travel sites must be getting paid off to overrate such a place.....$125 a night for this on Priceline was no deal.

marty from Carlsbad, CAWe stayed at the Signature for three nights this past week.
Having been to Vegas many times, and stayed at many different properties, I think I have enough experience to really compare this hotel to others. And really, it didn't come out on top.
First, the location. I love to walk. I'm really athletic and not one of those complainers who take the escalator everywhere because they're too lazy. 
That being said, I hated the Signature's location. It's far from the strip, and really - just getting to the strip is a chore. If you want to get to the middle of the action, it's hard to walk that far in heels. Ladies take note.
Also, the food was disgusting. Truly - we had food once at the pool and once from room service. I'm the sort of person who will pick a hair out of my food and keep eating, but even I was really disappointed at the quality of the food at this hotel. When I order nachos I don't want that easy cheese topping from 7-Eleven..seriously that is what we got. Salad drenched in dressing. Poor. 
Starbucks ran out of Blonde roast the entire time we were there. 
Pool service was crap - waitress having a personal conversation with another guest for literally 20 minutes while I had to wait for my drink. 
Room was really nice but I could hear the people in the room next door. That always drives me nuts. Our TV remote didn't work properly and the channel selection was definitely poor. 

Pros:
The bathroom was huge and gorgeous..I couldn't find the toilet at first lol!
Staff were nice.
Fitness centre was clean and good selection of machines.
Pools were really nice and sheltered so even though it was a bit windy, it was still hot enough to lay out.

All in all, we're staying at the Cosmopolitan next time.Whoa!  I was expecting much more from this place.  Obviously, we have all learned not to judge a book by its cover, but when I first stepped into this place, it looked pretty good.  Nice bar area, great view, etc.  But boy was I wrong.  

I was here for work and ate in the private room.  There was a price fixe menu put together for us.  Given this arrangement, I was all the more surprised by this restaurant's ability to properly execute my meal.  And it wasn't just me, a number of people had the same exact problem.

So for starters, we had some sort of sushi thing (odd for an italian restaurant but OK), an antipasto plate which was standard but good, and a shellfish plate consisting of oysters, mussels, crab legs, shrimp, and lobster.  This was the only excellent part of the meal.  Go figure, its the element of the meal that required the least amount of preparation.

We also had a primi piatti of linguini with shrimp and a spicy sauce which was decent.  The problems arose during the secondi piatti.  I ordered the 24 oz. Ribeye steak.  It came out essentially raw in the middle.  I typically like my steak medium rare, so I don't mind a little blood or pinkness in my steak.  But this thing was uncooked in the middle.  And I wasn't the only one.  I think 4 people in my party had to have their steak brought back to the broiler.  And if that wasn't enough, the sides were terrible as well.  The broccolini and polenta basically tasted like nothing.  I am still trying to figure out if the chef simply forgot to season the dishes.  Hopefully, I will never have to go to this restaurant again.  With excellent restaurants such as Nine and Alize residing in the Palms, I fear for the future of this restaurant.

I only gave the restaurant 2 stars because the shellfish plate was great and the service was decent.If you like lukewarm, textureless, and peculiar tasting sushi than this is the place for you. The happy hour is a joke.

 How about keeping the fish fresh instead of worrying about sprinkling multi colored fish eggs all over everything. 

We ordered a "platter" for $36 that had 6 pieces of cut roll style sushi on it. We also ordered some king crab sushi which tasted like they stole it from the buffet. Usually we argue over the last piece of sushi, but in this case it was because no one wanted it. Every piece was warm, mushy, and disappointing. The last roll was literally wet and tasted like a half chewed ham and cheese sandwich. 

We left hungry and with $150 less in our pockets.Stopped there on my way to work.  The bagel I got tasted like dirty mildewed water.  I don't know if this was due to what was cooked in the toaster before or bad butter or what but it was truly inedible.  The only reason they don't get one star for this experience is that it is the absolute first time I have had an issue at Einstein's.Meh. I love L V Buffets but this one is just meh. The Chinese food offerings were all stale and tough had been sitting way too long on the steam table. Ditto the pizza and enchiladas and hot dishes. The carved prime rib was better than typical of L V buffets, however. The crab legs are huge and plentiful. The dessert table is very weak relative to L V Buffet standards. If you are there and it is part of a hotel package, of course go and eat hearty. If you are serious about a good buffet experience, cab it up to the Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan or the one at the Wynn. Worth the trip, the fare and the effort.I remember as a kid going here with my dads friend and I thought this place was the best buffet in Las Vegas but after my recent visit here I cant believe how terrible it has gotten.

To begin the price is 29.99 so I was expecting at least something out of it.
First things first the alcohal section was horrible.
They only serve bud light for beer... not to mention they give it to you in a plastic cup
Red wine, White wine and Champagne were the cheapest selection ever!

Now for the food. The ONLY thing that I thought was tasty was the shrimp and the prime rib. OTHER THAN THAT I felt like I was eating some fast food crap.

The pizza was cold, The chinese food was worst than panda express, Chicken parmanese was too hard, The fish was not tasty at all, The crabs were small too and for christ sake the desert section had chocolate chip cookies and muffin seriously?

IS THIS MANDALAY BAY REALLY?

You want delicious buffet going to STUDIO B at the M HOTEL

PEACE!I think this place is the real reason that Jude is sad.  

I wanted to like it, because I love the Beatles and adore pretty neon lights.

BUT - the free promotional drinks that lured my friends and I here were hosted by Pink Vodka - a liquor that, although beautifully bottled, is disgusting and tastes like rubbing alcohol.

The drinks weren't pink, but I noticed my toenail polish was when I bent over to throw up the cheap vodka later in the evening.

My standards are pretty low, so to NOT meet them really says something.Revolution lounge is located inside the Mirage hotel.. there are people outside the lounge passing out VIP admission passes so there's no cover fee to get in... for the ladies free champagne Saturday before 12.. The music is pretty old school... & if you're 35 and above this might be the place to chill... me and my friend in our 20's didn't enjoy much while we were there cause everyone seems so old...If you want to overpay for a sandwich and you are too afraid to leave the hotel, it's fine.

Dear Mr Wynn. . . Please give me a shot to come in and try to increase sales at this restaurant.  It's such a great location with incredible potential.Eh...for the price ($10 at dinner with a 'rewards card' that you can get for free next to the buffet instead of paying the regular $14) it wasn't bad but I surely won't be running back. All the food is pretty tasteless/basic and you are really just going to stuff yourself. The line wasn't bad on a Monday evening (about a 10-15min wait) but the food was really unimpressive. I would honestly rather pay the extra $20-30 for a great buffet in downtown. But I suppose if you are a local and are looking for cheap/junky eats it might hit the spot. The pizza was 'decent'. Staff was nice.I really didn't care too much for this place.  The service was meh.  I had the bone-in rib eye steak - just okay.  Nothing spectacular about the sides - mac & cheese and loaded potato.  I felt like I spent way too much money on food that I think could have been better prepared.

It seems as though everyone else raves about this place.  Maybe I just came on a bad night?I do agree with others that the service is quite lacking. We had a large party of 8 and it took forever for the waitstaff to even take our drink orders. We weren't in a rush though, so it was tolerable. After overindulging, I'm less eager to return. Me + AYCE meat = indigestion. 

But if I do, I'll go straight for the fried plantains, flank steak and the lamb. Their specialty drinks and desserts are forgettable. I would grab these somewhere else.Ate in the bar area.

The music was too LOUD - I couldn't hear the person across from me.

Had the lobster egg roll - it was ok.  Nice and crunchy but the flavor was meh...

Had the meat that you cook on the hot rock..... Did it once, won't do it again. 

Had the spicy tuna roll - the rice was too wet

Had the hamachi negi roll - rice was too wet

Will only come here for the drinks next time.No. Just, no. 

We went on a slow day and had no idea what we were in for. Our server was nonexistent for the first 30 minutes, when she finally did show she took another 30 to get our beers. Did I mention the place was 1/4 full? Ridiculous. The coronas were 4 bucks which is crazy when you can walk over to Dos and get them for $2.50. The tables around us were also complaining at the lack of attention. The food here is bland at best. Just don't do it.My husband and I frequent sports bars since we are both sports nuts and sometimes watching a game at home by ourselves is a little dull. Saturday afternoon we were starting to go a bit stir crazy at home, so we decided to check out Upper Deck Sports Grill to watch the Jag/Pats playoff game. 

The only reason I am not giving this place one star is that there were tons of TVs with a variety of sporting events playing and I liked the two level idea. We sat on the second level at this mini bar that lines the balcony so we would have a great view of the two huge projection screens that were showing the football game.  Other than that, I have nothing positive to say about Upper Deck.  The service was horrific...my husband actually had to go to the bar on the second level to get our drinks and order our food because while there were waitresses walking around, they never came over to us.  The food was incredibly mediocre...I ordered the "kickin chicken wrap"...I am still trying to figure out what was kicking about it.  My husband got the chicken burrito and he didn't care for it.  The menu is really lackluster and not much about it envokes the sports bar idea.  The beer prices were a tad high for the most part, but our 64 oz. Bud Lite pitchers were $8.50 which we didn't think was too bad.

One of the most odd things about Upper Deck is the hodge podge assortment of universities or teams that claim the bar as their "viewing" place for games...Georgia Tech, Kansas, Virginia Tech, Michigan State, and the Philadelphia Eagles all had banners hanging up...weird.  What the common bond between them all is, I have no clue.  Needless to say, I will not be making a trip back to Upper Deck anytime in the future.As a Target Shopper, I would NOT recommend this store! While the stock/selection isn't bad - the Service generally is!! I always seem to ne amazed at the attitude/apathy of "many" of their staff. Tonight took the cake as I when I got home & reached for my new jammies + they weren't there! Neither was the outfit I planned on wearing tomorrow!! Turns out the Brainiac that checked me out (looked) like she was loading them into the tub I purchased, but instead was placing into some obscure spot she "forgot" about! I now have to drive ALL the way BACK tomorrow - which is not close for me! So ticked! Manager on phone could barely muster an apathetic "sorry." Which is EXACTLY what I'm talking about. UNreal. Skip this store if u can!Very average.

If I'm paying $70 for a 10 oz filet and $90 for a $25 bottle of wine, it better be the nicest place in town and the food should be fantastic.  I didn't have either at Strip Steak.  Not worth the money in my opinion.Mardi Gras made the switch from comedy club to full-fledged live music venue last year and has attracted a new crowd with its revamped atmosphere. The dive rock 'n' roll bar, which features a jukebox and attached restaurant (the Voodoo Lounge) is a great place to see live music. The sound system is awesome. 

The club is lacking a big following however since they tend to book anyone with a guitar. Some of the bigger shows included national alt-country act Shurman, Scotty Johnson of the Gin Blossoms and Steve Larson of Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers. Sadly there's more bands you probably haven't heard of that play here than well-established acts (like the above mentioned) with a following. Hopefully Mardi Gras will get a clue soon and start booking some better talent.This place used to be bomb. You can tell they are cutting corners now. They took off their best appetizer queso fundido, service was slow, no longer 24hours, and they barely comp drinks for players,got hasseled everytime I ordered a.drink and I was playing maMuch better options in town, no point of wasting time or money herex credits and fast. there are much better options in town, no point of wasting money or time hereClaim Jumpers is overpriced and overrated. The fried zucchini from Carls Jr. is better than Claim Jumpers. Their portions are large and filling but the lack of taste leaves you with no motivation to finish.Stop by to get a sundae as walk in there wasn't anyone there until we said hello then the employee came out, the place isn't clean, they use to be better and been here for awhile, but I guess things change. But it's okay if you just want to grab something to eat really quick and leave.Oh DCR ...how I loved thee.

It sucks because it used to be such a favorite spot to chill at... But the last couple of times have been less than worth the time. The service on nights like Monday and Tuesday when there are no events happening.. Is just not good. Will I be back? I hope so.. But literally the last two visits were all about slow/bad service, unknowlegable staff, and.. Even slower still service. 

So I recommend skipping it or don't go on the slow nights. seriously. Not to be mean..just don't waste your time.Boring.  This place was recommended to me by several people.  And I want to stop talking to them now.  It was a complete let down.  

First, of all, the prices?  What?! Three tacos, rice and beans $9?  No thank you.

Second, the tacos were $1.50 extra if you wanted cheese.  Then it was mozzarella cheese?  Gross.  If I wanted mozzarella, I would eat Italian.  

Third, the food was ok.  Nothing special.  Nothing amazing.  The salsa they put on the table was sweet and hot.  No one wants to eat that.  I had chorizo tacos and they were just ok...just ok.  

This is what Mexican food is for people who know nothing about a good taco.  Harsh?  I know.  But the truth is the truth.  And my tacos were terrible.  I have used "ok" probably about twenty times during this review.  It got two stars because the service was friendly.The goods:
  1) Its an all in 1 casino...there is food, gambling, childcare, a movie theater, a bowling alley....HUGE.
  2) The cheapest rooms are really nice.
  3) The extremely deep tub with television in the bathroom for relaxing.
  4) Its Vegas...
  5) The spa facility - wonderful!

The bad:
  1) The check in at this place is AWFUL...and thats no way to start off.  They had 2 people working and a line of over 20 when we came in, also there was no "set" line so you had people just standing everywhere.
  
   2) The minibar/PAY tray - There was a tray on the dresser that if you accidently even bumped stuff off it...if you didnt get it back on fast enough cha-ching! They charged you.  I dunno about you but 1- I usually drink when Im in vegas and its hard enough to not bump stuff sobber...2- this is suppose to be kid friendly....my 6 year old INSTANTLY was eyeballing this tray....We had to get them to remove it.
  
    3) The Imax in this facility is beyond bad.  BAD...the room is extremely tiny...and they fail to mention that if a seat is RED that nothing can be seen in 3D and infact that it will just appear double.  

  4) The distance to the strip.  It's over 20 mins away.

  5)  The price of the spa facility...its super lush and super nice....admitedly, but the price dampens that bit of fun by quite a bit.  Your looking at $150+ for a 50 min massage.

  6) Amenities fee, wth is THAT?  $30 a night (not including the room taxes) and Im not even sure what thats for.  Why not just roll that into the price of the hotel, so you arent wacked with it later?

  7) Food Poisoning....We had the buffet the first morning of our stay...needless to say, my 6 year old and my husband ate something there and ended up vomiting the rest of the stay.  Made the food bill cheap thou!  They didnt eat anything the rest of the stay! (sarcastic)


All in all, Im not sure I would go back.  I know what to expect now, but the cons out weighed the pros.

The kid's quest hourly child care would be about the only thing to lure me back, and they have that at other casinos.Decided to give this place a try. First of the wait to get seated was long. Waited over 30 mind to be seated. Then waited another 45 minutes for our various orders coming from the sushi chefs. There were so many to go orders coming in that were prioritized before all regular orders. I was expecting to be wow-ed from all the reviews but considering everything was a'la carte. The only wow moment was the market price blue fin tuna. Everything else felt the same as most sushi restaurants that I've been too. Wish the sushi was a little more chilled and not room temperature. Plus the service was poor. I was expecting so much more for what we spent but it was not worth it. I would rather spend the money I spent there at a nice steak house restaurant.Wanted to have a meal close to home and decided to try this place on someone's recommendation. Severely dissapointed!
I was debating what chicken to try, in my quest to eat high protein, and the server suggested that the pollo a la planchia was really good. I took her recommendation and decided to order this. The chicken breasts were pounded and marinated and grilled. I found the chicken to be too oily and also the onions that came as a garnish to be very oily. Since it took over 20 min, for us to get our order, and the entrees were priced at $14 I think, I expected more. Instead of rice, I asked for a salad which they got-lettuce, tomatoes without any dressing. This came with a side of beans in a smallish bowl and I took 1 bite as I did not like the way it tasted and looked. I asked for hot salsa and got 2 bottles of chilli sauce.

D had the Havana Grill Pollo Salteado which came with rice and beans. It was ok. The serving was quite big but lacking in flavor.

The positive was the server who greeted us promptly and brought glasses of iced water and some bread. Even though it was not too busy, they took long bringing out the food, and then bringing the check as well.

I will not be going back.It looks like I'm in the minority here, but I didn't think Bouchon's macarons were anything approaching good.

They're large for sure, about the size of the palm of my hand and reasonably priced at $3.50 each. No creative flavors available - just the classics of chocolate, caramel, coffee, vanilla, pistachio & raspberry.

The large cookie size meant that the ratio of shell to filling was way off (too much cookie) and my raspberry was a tad stale. Service was pretty crap too - the attendant couldn't have been more disinterested.

Honestly, it's my fault - who buys a French pastry in an Italian-themed casino? Lesson learned.Used to love this place for years. They used to have the best almonds chocolate croissants. Croissants ate still good but what happen to the service with a smile?! What's with the attitude?!I have eaten at the Landmark dozens of times over the last ten years and have generally been satisfied. Several weeks ago, a friend of mine and I ate the pasta salad from the salad room and two hours later, we were both very sick. I know it was the pasta salad because that's the only thing that both of us ate. We were both sick and had the same symptoms. I called the restaurant to let the know what had happened and spoke to a female manager. She was extremely rude to me and told me that we probably had the "flu" or something else as nobody else had gotten sick except for the two of us. She did not offer anything to make the situation right and told me that if I didn't want to come back in there, I didn't have to. I wasn't expecting a comp or anything like that; just an apology and a promise to look into the situation would have sufficed. She took NO responsibility for anything and made it seem like I was a neurotic who was wasting her precious time. I have not been back in there since and will not go back; not because of the food but because of the poor way I was treated by the manager. I have been a restaurant manager myself and I know that's no way to treat a customer.I'm not a huge fan of this store, but prices are often good and it's 3 minutes away from where I live. There is usually something ghetto going on here, in store and in the parking lot, such as people selling tamales out of their trunks, people buying groceries with food stamps and paying cash for cigarettes, and other various stupidities, so it's not really a great environment. EDIT: There was a guy asking for money in the aisles during the 2010 holiday season... I'm like, REALLY?? And you're asking at the most ghetto grocery store ever where the customers are mostly money pinching and paying with ebt? I couldn't believe it.

About the produce department mentioned in the other review, I disagree. It is a good size with good prices but every time I attempt to buy something from there, EVERY piece of produce I pick up is bruised or has something wrong with it... and I refuse to buy crappy produce. I have bought meat here though and it was fine. Basically, avoid buying produce here unless it's just potatoes or something that's difficult to mess up. Even the onions and oranges here suck constantly. I go here to pick up frozen food and soup and other basics, but otherwise try to avoid the place.Yes... I went to Popeye's for dinner tonight.  I had a craving for popcorn shrimp and it was the closest thing to satisfy my hunger.  Is it just me or are their portions shrinking?  My popcorn shrimp was good and finger-lickin' greasy like I expected, but I could have eaten 3 times the amount! I guess that explains why they don't have a kid's menu and my boyfriend's son couldn't get a damn toy! They have obviously melded the two menus together and now I get to pay $6.95 for a combo that is kid-sized.The suite was very nice.  Newly remodeled, clean and spacious.  The service was great.  The staff was kind and very helpful.  My main complaint was with the waterpark.  We arrived on a Saturday around 3pm.  The park was filthy!  The bathrooms were smelly and dirty.  The garbage cans were overflowing.  The pools were not clear.  It was overcrowded and very unpleasant. It was so bad we left and went to the pool near the room. That too was almost green and the water was hot.  There were kids running and screaming everywhere.

When I complained the front desk staff said that was common for a Saturday in the summer.  The bell hop told us it would be much better on Sunday.

He was right, the next day we had a much better experience although the waterpark still was not clean.  There were dirty bandaids on the walls of the lazy river, plastic cups in the water, food on the floors.  I expected much more.  The McDowell Mountain Aquatic Center has a much cleaner facility with similar features.

There are too many resorts in this area for us to ever come back to Squaw Peak.  The pool at our Lifetime Fitness is much nicer than what this resort had to offer.I think the concept of AMC Esplanade 14 is great and the remodel is definitely looking nice but honestly,  the last thing I want while i'm sharing a room with far too many strangers is the smell of someones Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar lingering from behind me for two hours. Can't we enjoy movies with a drink, Red Vines, and popcorn anymore? Why do you need a New York Strip while you watch Prometheus?  I just don't get it. 3D movie plus a huge meal= vomit. Just saying.

Plus, who wants someone (servers) walking back and forth, back and forth, yada yada.. while you are trying to watch a movie? They do a great job of being quiet, courteous, etc.. but over all the service is just ok. We told our server before we ordered that my boyfriend and I were on a separate check from a friend and he still only brought us one check. Super annoying. 

I say, if you are going to have a menu keep it small. They have tons of drink options that seem like they would be great but again, I doubt I'll down a margarita in a movie theatre. I promise I'm not boring. Hell, maybe I am. 

I'm sure many people will rave about this and go on and on about how great it is to ring your server 5 times during a movie for more food... god. But this just isn't for me. I'll go and I'll bring my own Milk Duds and Red Vines. Don't tattle.Gargantuan and Inconsistent!

In a city where everything is larger than life, Caesar's Palace is probably the king. This is something to think about when booking - because getting from point A to point B in this palace-place is going to eat up your time.

In terms of the standard services - guest check-in/out, bell staff, housekeeping, spa, taxi line, doormen, you'll be dealing with some very nice people and experience attentive service - and for this excellence - the star rating of this hotel is warranted. But remember - this is a massive hotel - that often appears understaffed - so sometimes your wait for this excellent service is going to be a bit longer than you'd expect.. And - while the general staff was wonderful - a small brush with management over a water shut down (for seven hours - with no planned adjustment to the bill) - showed management to be unpleasant, aloof, and disconnected from the guest experience. No stars for management.

The rooms themselves are great, if you're staying in the recently renovated Forum Tower. There, Caesar's Palace appears a five-star hotel. However, if you're in the Roman Tower expect the average-quality of a three-star hotel that has seen better days.

The best thing about this hotel was the Spa - which - while quite expensive - was worth the price and experience.

In other - wifi will run you about 15 bucks a day for service - but only in your room. If you want to access the hotel wifi from other areas of the property, you're looking at an additional fee.

Overall - while the stay was okay - the size of the hotel got to be cumbersome - and the inconsistency of value an annoyance.We have heard about this place for quite a while. Given the friend reviews and the look of the building, one would think it was more of an upscale breakfast joint. Instead we were greeted to a large open restaurant that was very loud and with what seemed like a group of robot teenagers running the place. The sense of urgency (to be seated, take order, etc) was there (as they rushed us through every bit of our visit) but with no individuality or customer service. Autopilot. 

First, we are shown to a table that is not ready for us and we are left standing in the middle of the dining room. Very awkward. Then the waitress asks us what we would like to drink. Coffee for him, coffee for me and.....had to get her to stop the robot talk (and almost flag her down as she walked away) so I could order an OJ. Since it was our 1st time, we took a bit of time to decide what to eat. The open menu on the table with my face buried in it should have been the first clue I wasn't ready to order. But the robot-server came by 3 times ready to write everything down; and I mean everything, spelled out and repeated as she wrote. Wow... 

The food was OK. A little on the bland side, but tasty. The chorizo was very flavorful and the sausage gravy was excellent. The menu is extensive with something for everyone - French toast, crepes, pancakes, skillets, specialties and more). The food came out very fast which was good because we were hungry! 

Maybe my expectations were too high in general. I truly thought this place would have been nicer. If I want my check delivered to me in the middle of my meal, I would have eaten at Denny's. I was shocked and surprised.Good place to get ice cream water whatever u need staff is awesome only downside is they don't have enough room to keep out all the ice cream flavor they have out so if u have a taste for something it may not be outPeople must come here for the owners or the pizza, because what we experienced last night was just mediocre.

The penne in cream sauce was just plain. Presentation was bleah. Caesar was okay. Chicken was dry and there was a bit too much dressing.

If you want romantic and quaint, this isn't it. Think pizza joint with slightly better decorations.

I would say if you're in the area, go to VinciTorio's. We seemed to be the only non-regulars, so I must be missing something. Probably will not return.I read all the hype on this place and was hoping for some great food and instead left wishing we had just eaten fast food. 

I tried the old staple of chicken parmesan as it seemed a popular choice and I will never go there again.  It tasted like a frozen chicken patty with canned tomato sauce.  It came with spaghetti on the side and that too was not only overcooked, but just gross.

My girlfriend had the gnocchi with pink sauce and again it underwhelmed.  I know finding good gnocchi is difficult but to me, the sauce again fell flat.  It all tasted store bought and out of cans or jars.

When I go out somewhere I want to eat something that I can't fix at home myself.  Not only could I have made it but I could have made it MUCH better.  The only redeeming thing I liked about the food was the bread at the start.  

As for the ambience, it is small and had a quiet feel to it but looking around, all the artwork (most of) are pictures you buy from Target...And there wasnt much other decor around to give you that Italian feel to it other than the waiter's accent which to me seemed very over the top whether he is authentic or not.  Sometimes I couldn't even understand him. 

Either way, for the price I know you can get better Italian food.  Try Cucina Tagliani.  I felt Nick's was overpriced, underwhelming, and not worth me ever going back.  It wasn't the worst food in the world but it wasn't anything memorable by any means.Same issue as everyone else.  You budget a certain amount and that means crap.  They will constantly add additional charges.  At first it was a $6.99 charge for "modem rental" which is only waived when you have a landline as well as internet.  Cancelled my land line over a year ago and suddenly, it was something that was "supposed" to kick in but never did.  So, I am stuck with a $6.99 charge on my bill.  They downgraded my internet, assuring me that it wouldn't affect my services (which it didn't) but a few months later, they raise the price for their services $7.00.  A lot of good that did me.  Thanks asshats.
So I call in and I'm supposed to be transferred to customer loyalty.  First time the call is dropped, call back in and have to give the whole story again.  Again, they try to transfer me to customer loyalty.  After 25 minutes of dead air, I hang up and call back in.  This time I ask them to transfer me to a person, not just transfer me to dead air again.  I finally get a hold of someone who can only offer me a $5 discount on service for 1 year.  My bill is still the "prorated amount" which means I am still paying the full bill this month but it will be going down $5 starting next month (read, I am still paying $2 more per month than I was).
Ridiculous.  Apparently sticking with a company for 8 years means nothing.Nothing overly bad about it.  It's your standard Peter Piper.  I think my problem was more with the clientele than the employees or the facility.  I was born and raised in the barrio, but come on......kids were acting like their parents weren't even there.  When your kids are over ten, you need to let them know that Peter Piper and Chuck E Cheese aren't really for you anymore.  These kids were ten and twelve acting like they were five.  My grandma would have smacked em.  My parents would not have taken us there in the first place.  If it were just for the food and employees, it would be a three.  The customers make it a 2.  Rude!I have had some good experiences at this Chick-fil-A, but I have had a couple bad experiences that I seem to remember more.

To say something positive about the restaurant, the employees certainly are very pleasant and polite. It is actually pretty surprising for a fast food type place.

However, I ordered from the drive-thru a few nights ago with my wife and we both ended up feeling awful after eating their food. All I know is that it will be a long while before we are willing to give Chick-fil-A another chance.Was at the chilis for over 2 hours and nothing seemed to go as planned. Everything thing took 2 times longer than need. The wrong flat bread was brought out, and the French fries were never brought out. The food was cold and we were over charged for the fajitas. Been here before and it's always hit or miss, but this goes down as the worse experience. Nothing was comped which after that many mistakes you would think something would have been comped. Will never return.I figured there would be a bunch of college chicks drinking beer here. There was not. They had Left Hand Stout on draft which is alright. Where the hell were all of the college girls? I didn't get to creep any of them out!Used to eat here all the time but the last couple times they have been horrible. food tasted old and chips are not fresh anymore. maybe they changed cooksi dont know but they are not the same Manny's with awesome food and reasonably price. :( 
Ive left a great review in the past and not my stomach churns every time we pas by this place :(I would have liked to rate them well as they are a typical mom and pop store unfortunately all the 3 times I have been there the food is passable at the best. The air is also thick with burnt wok oil which ruins ones hunger if you sit around for too long(bad ventilation).

They do have wonderful service and generous portions, but that has never been a redeeming feature for restaurants.

So far I have tried the Kung pao, the Singapore noodle and the firecrackerNo sweet potato fries anymore and $2 for a tea? McDonalds here I come! And their regular fries have changed yet again.Used to be much better but the quality has gone down recently. Drinks are chalky and way too sweet. Won't be returning any time soon.Pizza isn't half bad....but it's way overrated, and overpriced. If I want good pizza there are plenty of places I would think to go before Grimaldi's.Steak tasted like chewy rubber, had to wait forever to get water, games are over priced. Really feel like there is no organization, I only go here when forced or because its on someone else's tab.I should have read reviews before heading here. I had heard from several folks that this was a good place to eat, and we had heard that the wings were out of this world. Yeah, not quite.

First of all, the ambiance is not that great. Lots of small, loud children. 

The service was very average. We had three servers ask us if we had been helped yet, which I suppose is a good thing, but they all seemed very confused and not sure if we were their table. But good that they asked. Our actual server took quite a while to greet us, and of course he forgot my water. Brought the beer though! 

We started with wings and we wanted to split them...two flavors. At first he told us we couldn't do that, even though it says right on the menu that you can. He made it seem as though he was doing us a favor by splitting them for us! They tasted more like chicken fingers and not wings. Way too much breading. 

I had the California burger, hubby had the fish and chips. The burger was overdone, but I expected it would be so I ordered it medium to get it to medium well. It was well done. Thankfully I didn't order well done! Otherwise it wasn't bad for this kind of place. I also order the potato chips as a side since they make them there. The chips were burnt.  The fish was seriously over breaded (apparently they like doing that here) and way too big. The baked potato and cole slaw...very average. 

Now all that being said.....our bill was very cheap ($33) and that included two beers, wings, and two entrees. 

Want cheap food and average service? Go here! Otherwise, try somewhere else.Why does it seem like the people working at the counter act like you're bothering them when all you want is a little eye contact to order? Did the service go downhill or what? They ran out of rice, so it took a minute for them to make some more so then I make my way to pay first so I'm not holding up the line. But I make sure I tell the girl that I wanted cheese, sour cream AND lettuce before I went to pay. 

Of course she forgets to put lettuce in there, and when I asked her if she had put lettuce in it, she slowly sighed, and slowly unrolled the burrito and put it in there. Dude if you don't like your job, go work somewhere else. Sorry.. your life sucks? Either way I don't have time for your dumb attitude.

What the suck.yet another groupon try... 
They have a HUGE menu, which excited me greatly, upon first gaze, however the results weren't so great. I had the Mama Leone. The bread was kinda gummy, the meats were ok, but there sure wasn't much to this sandwich.. it was supposed to be hot, but it was just lukewarm, and the marinara sauce was also cold. Yuck. 
Also, the Little Italy Salad was served not-as-described by the menu (they didn't include croutons, or onions.. it was just lettuce, tomatoes, and meat. that's it!).  Finally, the dining area is cluttered, and needs to be de-crumbed.Typical chinese buffet their attempt at serving a lot of seafood for your money's worth  falls short because there are heeps of people lined up like there was a blow out sale for the crab legs.  Once you do get the crab legs they are over salted so you won't want to eat more.  The sushi was super fishy and other entrees dry as they are left out on the heating pad.  The one yummy thing is the mongolian bbq & fried chinese donuts.. but $20 for that? No thanks.Just moved to the westside of town and decided to look up Ted Wiens, since I always hear it on the radio. With the good reviews here, and with the GM actually responding to people, I figure I would give it a shot. 

Took my 2006 Pontiac G6 in for a check engine light check with an AutoZone diagnostic paper that narrowed it down to an EGR valve issue. The gentleman there told me that they would take $100 from the diagnostic and apply it to the cost of repair, from what I understood. Anyway, quoted for $318, so I went ahead and let them do it since it was cheaper than Meineke or my dealership.

Fast forward two hours later and my car was ready to be picked up. We walked there, and I received my bill and was told I had $368 due, since they did a half diagnostic and didn't take any amount off, I was a little shocked by it. Then I pulled out my debit card and the gentlemen said my grand total was now $409. I took back my card and said I was ORIGINALLY quoted $368, and he said in a quiet voice "Oh yeah, that was before tax...". At this point I was very upset, but kept my temper and the cashier brought down my total to $381 and some change.

Honestly, from the reviews here I am very disappointed. The repair was wonderful, however the service was sub-par and I felt robbed because I was quoted for three different amounts and was upcharged for a service I did not necessarily need.

I will probably be back for basic maintenance, but I am now afraid of getting any major service done from this place. Chris P, keep up the good work replying to these reviews. Props.I booked online 2 weeks early and that was a smooth transition, but when I got to the room the pillows were so flat I couldn't sleep on them! This hotel doesn't even offer complimentary breakfast. When I got to the pool area I was sooooo disappointed the pool was dirty! It had bugs all on the edges of the pool :(I really don't like writing negative reviews but I was quite disappointed with The Maple Tree. I was excited to try this place after seeing it on Restaurant Impossible. If this is "after" transformation, I wonder what the "before" was like.

Even though it doesn't  fit in with the Asian businesses in the shopping center, the interior is nice and quaint.  We went on a Sunday morning and were the only non-Senior citizens for some reason. Luckily they have high chairs so they are kid friendly.

They advertised the Monte Cristo sandwich on their window so I ordered that along with Red Velvet Pancakes. My husband ordered the Country Fried Steak. We both got coffee and it tasted watered down. I didn't taste any Red Velvet in my pancakes. The Monte Cristo was interesting but nothing special. The Country Fried Steak was chewy and the batter wasn't sticking and wasn't flavorful at all. Their famous apple fritter was hard and didn't taste fresh. I has high hopes that I would like at least one thing we ordered since we ordered a lot of items; however we didn't like a single one of them.

Albeit the tasteless food, the service was good. The hostess and servers were friendly and attentive. 

I was surprised to learn that they have two other locations in town which makes me wonder how they survive with mediocre food. Sadly, I will not be back.On October 8th,  at my recommendation, 13 of my closest friends and I decided to eat at Charlie Palmer's Steakhouse. I have been to one other Charlie Palmer Restaurant and had a good experience and therefore thought that the quality of food at the steakhouse would be just as good.  I am a local Las Vegas attorney and routinely frequent many of the higher end steakhouses in the Las Vegas valley including Del Frisco's, STK at the Cosmopolitan, The Capital Grille, etc.  The prices at the Charlie Palmer's Steakhouse were comparable to other high end steakhouses and hence I expected that the quality would be on par.  I ordered the 40 oz Tomahawk Bone-In Ribeye which cost $110 (not including side dishes). The steak had very little marbling and was overcooked.  Put simply, the steak lacked flavor.  Moreover, at no time did the waiter ask me about the quality of my cut, which for a high end steakhouse is unusual.   Perhaps, the chef that night was having an "off night" but I am unlikely to return to Charlie Palmer Steakhouse.Here is a fun game to play while relaxing in the hot tub at the Canyon Ranch SpaClub - count the missing tiles!  This used to be my favorite spa in Vegas, and I have been to nearly all of them multiple times.  I was looking forward to returning, but was amazed at the disrepair.  There are probably nearly 50 tiles missing from the hot tub.  What is that sharp, pokey thing under my foot?  Why, it's a loose tile that I then fished out.  I would have loved to take a picture of the all the missing tiles in the two in-tub lounge seats, but no photos in the spa.  Perhaps they are counting on that.

Here is another fun game.  Go into the Igloo (cold room) and look behind the frosted glass covering the lights on the wall.  That is black mold growing that you are inhaling when you are enjoying your cool down.

And they still are charging $175 for a 50 minute massage.  All the price, but they have given up on the facilities.  Brow wax is done in the noisy salon with a lady that was rushing the process as fast as possible (taking the mirror from my hand as I am looking at my new brows?!? am I that slow?!?)

Check out was slow, when I was assured that my bill would be ready to sign when I left.  And no one asked how many experience was - otherwise, I would have gladly explained my lacking experience.

The bright spot was my massage (hence, the 2nd star).  Leticia (Leti) was really amazing.  She listened to what I was looking for in my massage, and executed wonderfully.  Unfortunately, I just don't think I can come back to this place to see her.Stayed here for 3 nights.  

Overall, I found the hotel itself amenable to sleep - but the staff were entirely clueless and unprofessional.

When we checked in, our first room had an *overpowering* smell of cleansing material - so much so, we had to move rooms.

To make matters worse, my wife cut her foot in our (well, their) room and the staff were virtually apathetic to helping her. They offered us a new room, but we needed to leave the next day - thus, no good.  I felt like I needed to argue to get some kind of financial comp for an issue that was not our - this to the hotel  manager, Ashley.

I was left disappointed and would not recommend this hotel.The place looks like you are going to get the best Mediterranean food in Vegas, Buy it is not. I didn't like the food at all. The Gyro was the worst I have ever had.  And silly me for ordering Pizza from a Mediterranean place. One word Gross. I will Not be returning to this place.I was rolling over 3 stars but figured 2 would do it more justice. We spent 2 nights here and I tried to stay in the room as minimal as possible. 

Review is for room only... its very rundown looking. Those flowery cheap curtains that match the bed sheets. Restroom was very confined. My car trunk seemed bigger. Not that I have used it as a restroom or so. 

Aside from the room... everything else is just just average or below. Valet dude was polite. Insisted on tip even tho he never parked our car. Parking lot is pretty big, always found a good spot. Front desk guy was cool... however offered no help on whats going on ON the Strip as far as shows an attractions goes. FAIL! 

2/5 because I have had MUCH better. Esp in Vegas!Food wasn't that great!  Since I had ordered noodle soup, I asked for a little bit of bean sprout and they had to charge me $1 for just a tiny bit!!! How cheap and no customer service.  And they don't carry soup spoons...big problems when this is an Asian restaurant....All the noodle soup place have soup spoons...tsk tsk tsk!!!!Here is what I can tell you about The Mix, it is a mix of the following;

people on overpriced alcohol
people on *e*
people on shrooms
people on acid
people on pot

okay, and whatever all of the people I didn't know were doing. 

All of this would seem to make for a happy experience. Especially while enjoying an unbelievable view of the strip after being whisked upstairs by the most adorable elevator operator who had hair that rivals Savs and a pinstripe suit that was neither too trendy nor too retro to not just be totally fucking cool. 

Too bad the door guy downstairs was a lying judgmental piece of shit. Thank God I only encountered the elevator guy, because had I run into the door guy I would have had to knock off more stars than I already did just hearing the stories about him.I never thought I'd give this place a negative review. I've been coming here for years. Every time I come to Vegas I ALWAYS come here. 

So I just got here and ordered the traditional Irish breakfast. I was born and raised in Ireland so I know what to expect. 

So when I got the food I was very disappointed. You get half a sausage, half a piece of bacon. So many potatoes u don't know what to do with and even sweet potatoes. How's that Irish? Very disappointed! 

Anyway, if your expecting traditional Irish food - it's not here. It's catered to American tourists who don't know what Irish food is. 

The Guinness was great that's why I'm giving two stars.I ordered a vegan chicken dish and when it came to the table it was a side of white rice, steamed broccoli, and chik'n nuggets...not impressed!We enrolled my son here for the preschool program with the hope to have him learn with some structure to his classroom and expose him to social interaction with his peers. He attended this "school" for the entire  year only so that we did not disrupt his experience. We are so glad to not be returning. The teachers at the school are caring and sweet, but I think the teacher-student ratio is too high for what I am paying for this place. They are not able to give each child adequate attention for this young age. 

Also, the front desk is extremely unfriendly and one woman in particular has a very sour attitude all the time. My biggest complaint is they are inconsistent with discipline. If my child has a tantrum (common at this age), they are quick to call us to pick him up and do not credit you for the day. However, there is a child in class who has bitten other children several times and the only thing the school does is call both parents ( the biter child and the bitten child) to "document" it for their records. I find this unacceptable! If this is repeated behavior for this bully child and the parents cannot curtail their kid, the child should be expelled or suspended. The school has done very little other than covering their own butt. My child is not having a good experience at your school if he is being bitten every other time he attends class. While I understand kids will be kids, the school cannot be so passive. This is a private school and one child should not be habitually jeopardizing the safety of the others.

In addition, their program advertises a structured curriculum, but I did not feel they stuck to this well. My son does not even start and end in the same classroom with the same kids each day, nor does he have the same teacher for the day. They switch off based on their own schedules. How does this create structure for a child?  They claim they will encourage a potty training environment, but I saw no evidence of this all year. 

In summary, we tried to be patient and to talk to the director about our concerns, but in the end our experience was very disappointing. I definitely do not classify this as a school, more like an overpriced daycare. Would not recommend this place to anyone, unless you are okay gambling with your child's safety and well-being.Not the best pho but it's at least pho. $12 and not much to choose from in terms of selection. I'm used to spending half the price and getting a bowl twice as big from traditional pho places. There's only one bowl size here, and it would be considered a small/regular at most pho places.

This place seems like half high-end pho restaurant, and half diner. Service here is so-so, especially for the small crowd at the time. As for the pho, the broth was very disappointing. Not only was it somewhat bland, but temperature-wise, it was lukewarm. Not only was I able to finish my pho quickly, but because it wasn't hot, it took a long time for the pieces of meat to cook in the broth.

Overall, if you want something different in a casino, this is a good option. But if you want good pho, make the drive to Chinatown and get the good stuff.I cannot find anywhere on here to review their concert venue, PH Live, so I'll just review it here.  ***This is not based on the hotel itself, or the Miracle Mile shops, or the restaurants there.  

Attended the Linkin Park concert with a friend this past weekend. Ticket stub said 9:00pm.  Didn't say if doors were opening earlier, or if that was when doors were opening. We arrived at 815pm, parked in the lot across from the parking garage on Audrie Lane?..whatever the road is behind there to access the parking garage.  
Got to the venue at 830pm. There was a line, as expected.  We started walking to find the end of the line....and walked, and walked...and walked. We actually stopped for a beer at Ocean One Bar and Grille. Took it to go as the line seemed to be moving. We walked, and walked, and walked...finally ended up by Cabo Wabo, which is the complete opposite end of where we started!!! It's now 850pm. We ask the security guard directing people into line, if all of these people are going to get into the venue in time for the show in 10 minutes. She shrugged. We asked if my friend's Diamond Status with the hotel had any "help" for us getting in quicker, again no clue. We decided to forego standing in line and headed through the casino to the other side where we started. The band was playing already. :/    I went up to a security guard by the door and asked about the Diamond Card and sure enough, we got right through, no waiting. Had to chug our beers.  "Beers" as in another we bought expecting to wait a long time. I feel bad for the people that were in line on the other side of the mall. Linkin Park played about an hour and 15 minute set, and I'm sure those at the end of the line saw maybe 20 minutes of the show at the most. 

They seriously need to open the doors earlier, or find a way to move people in quicker because it's just not working....I'm probably a little biased in this review because of the fact that I can't stand disorganized stores. There are about 5 long aisles of merchandise in the store and it is almost completely random of what you will find (and where you will find it). From my understanding, unknown items come in each week with very good deals. The catch is that you have to be willing to maneuver your way through the mess to get to them... almost like a second-hand store. Not my thing. 

I'm willing to pay a few more dollars for an item to go into a store and find it located neatly in its place; a place that I know where it is; a place that I know I will find it. (i.e. you need sheets? You know that you can go to target and they're going to have a good selection of brands, styles, and colors... and you know what section of the store you'll find them in... and they're sorted on the shelves in an order that you can quickly find the size you need).SERVICE WAS NON EXISTENT..  I asked for an 8 on spicy scale for curry it was a two.. I know I'm white but an eight for a white guy should still be like a six.. Too expensive too.. They need to get there stuff together.. Too many Thai options in area to drop the ball on customer serviceExpensive mediocre food and i had terrible service. Mexican food should not be expensive. The best thing was the raspberry hibiscus tea.This may be the last time I go Indigo. Don't get me wrong, for Scottsdale the price is right, and I never have a problem getting a last minute room. But it seems really rundown here and a few things left me with a sour taste during my one night stay. First up, there was a harsh smell of sewage in my room, couldn't detect where it was coming from... you'd think the bathroom but it got more faint the closer to the bathroom I moved. Also the shower tile needed to replaced a year or two ago, cracked, chipped, dingy. The food at the bar is pretty meh and it's not cheap. But Justin works hard and he's up for some conversation if that's you're thing. I think I'd rather spend more and hit up somewhere else in the hood like the Ho or Firesky.Had this for lunch recently, and it was meh.  I had the california burger with the fresh chips. The chips were tasty (although I prefer the kind at Omelette House, they are a bit thicker). The burger was a standard burger, prepared as described.  Nothing knocked my socks off, but nothing was awful either.

Service was prompt, but imperfect.  My companion ordered an iced tea with no lemon.  The waitress returned with it in about 20 seconds, with a lemon on top. No big deal, but it's an indicator.

There were two other observations:

1. The pricing was a bit steep given the current economy.  NO burger is worth $10.  My regular haunt (Lakes Lounge) is half the price, with excellent service, and imho better food.  With that said, the place was packed when I got there at noon, so I guess they don't need to lower their prices.

2.  The menu would lead one to believe that they are control freaks.  I went in wanting to get breakfasty food, but breakfast was not available after 11a.  This is the first pub I have run into that doesn't have a decent breakfast special for $4-5 that is available 'round the clock.  I mean, it's frickin' eggs, right?  It's worth noting that the burger I ordered comes with 2 fried eggs.  I looked at the other side of the menu, and the dinner menu was also time-restricted.  I get that, I suppose, as many of the items are not quick-makes.  Anyway, I went in hoping for one thing, and ended up settling for an ok burger.A single scoop gelato was about $5.75 and it was not worth it @ all and a croissant was about $4. It was hard and we had to get it warmed up. Then it came out burnt. Dissapointed that this did not meet my expectations especially since its in Bellagio.Lots of hype around this place, lines all the way out the door all the time... The first time I ate here, I had the Fontina Burger, and was quite underwhelmed.  I also had the date shake, which had barely any date in it.  I didn't want to write the place off, however, since Joe's Real BBQ is one of my favorite restaurants.

This time, I went with the hot dogs: Carolina and Sonoran.  The Carolina dog sounded pretty good, with its pulled pork, BBQ sauce, and slaw toppings.  It was decent, but not as awesome as I thought it'd be.  The franks seemed to be decent quality, and the buns were nice.  If you get a dog, this is probably the best option.

Now, I knew going in that the Sonoran Dog would not be an authentic Sonoran dog.  Sour cream?  Really?  But I tried it anyways, hoping it would at least be good, even if not a Sonoran Dog.  It was underwhelming; seriously, guys, at least make it spicy.  If it doesn't even have that in common with a real Sonoran Dog, why is it called that?  A Sonoran Dog has pinto beans, bacon, mayo, mustard, pico de gaullo, tomatillo sauce, is served on a bolillo roll, and is served with a grilled hot pepper.  You can't just slap some bacon and beans on a hot dog and call it a Sonoran Dog.  This should be a crime.  This is a blatant affront to all of the hardworking Mexican immigrants who, through their efforts, created Arizona's finest contribution to the culinary landscape.

The outdoor seating is nice.  That's really about it.  They don't even have the awesome homemade root beer or lemonade they have at Joe's Real BBQ. Skip this, and stick with Joe's other restaurants.Sorry, I cannot give Al's Garage a good feedback. We were there Saturday evening. There was a free concert, and although it was crowded, we found a nice place to eat outside on the patio. We ordered chicken tenders with fries. They were alright, but nothing to write home about. 
We were very patient, but after about 10 minutes, we asked if we could order. It took another 5 minutes until the waitress came to our table. She was very unfriendly and probably unhappy to work that evening. For whatever service we needed (napkins, refill etc) we had to battle to get her attention. She had no smile, or apology whatsoever... The people we shared the table with waited to pay for about 15 minutes. They were also not very satisfied...
There are too many good places around, so why bother and go back...LIving on the strip in a condo makes this one of the spots that I frequent most.  The reason for my 2 stars today is all due to the service I just experienced for our server JILLIAN.  Where do I even start!?

As we were being seated by the sweet hostess, I noticed a young blonde girl sweeping by our table.  After being seated and looking at the menu for 3 or so minutes, that same girl who was sweeping came to our table.  She NEVER gave us her name, just asked what we wanted to drink.  Now I have been a server and a bartender at many places and I know the Universal Steps of Service!! Always start by being polite and saying Hello, my name is.... Come on! Common Sense!!! Anyway, she took our drink order and came back with it.  I had water my friend had an Iced Tea.  She forgot to bring a lemon with it.  That is also common sense.  She didn't try to up sell beverages.  Normally you ask, would you like to start off with a pepsi, ice tea, or an ice cold beer etc. but this was not even offered to us.  She then took our order and walked off.  I noticed that there was only one silverware wrap-up on the table and she did not notice it.  I waited to see if she would catch that.  Our food was delivered by a food runner and that food runner didn't catch the 1 silverware roll up either so I stood up and grabbed one from another table.  The food runner, also female said nothing to us. She did not ask if we had everything, if we needed anything, or to even enjoy our meal.  Jillian, was no where to be found.  We had our food for about 5 minutes before she even came over to see if we were okay or if the food was cooked correctly.  Well, my fries were a bit cold but I let it slide.  Our drinks ran low, so I pushed my glass toward the end of the table with hopes she would see it.  As she stood with her arms crossed against the wall I started to get mad.  Everybody knows when a drink is half full you refill it, but mine was completely empty. As she stood against the wall looking around I wondered how she did not "see" this.  As she walked to the back to avoid us I stood up and POURED MY OWN WATER from a pitcher that was by us.  YES, I poured my own water.  As I did this a server named ALEX came over and he was so polite and sweet.  He asked us if we were okay and if we needed anything.  He grabbed my friend more ice tea and he then bussed our table and took the dishes we weren't using all while our own sever Jillian watched him.  She is something else.  

Being a server is a team effort.  I would be livid if I had to pick up the slack for a lazy server who clearly was hating her life that day and who showed she did not want to be there.  So, with that said, I asked Alex what her deal was.  He said she was upset because her guest had been stiffing her or tipping poorly all day.  WELL I WONDER WHY!! Now comes the best part, she asked if we wanted desert then dropped our check off.  Her name was on the check so that is the only way I got her name.  I asked for a manager and relayed all of this to her as well.  The manager was extremely responsive and helpful.  She offered to do something for us but I said no.  I was not looking for a hand out just good service.  I told her that Jillian's poor attitude and lack of serving skills makes their place look bad and I just wanted to address the issue so Jillian's attitude could be adjusted for her next set of patrons.  Our bill was $29.00 so we left Jillian $3.00.  That is more than she deserved clearly.  Since I am in the Vegas service industry I just couldn't leave nothing.  I get it, we work for tips and that is our sole income.  But as I walked out I did hand Alex a $20 tip for being so polite and helpful.  He deserved it.  Now, the kicker of this whole experience..... as we left Jillian yelled out, "ADIOS" in a snide tone.   Are you kidding me!! How old are you!? So I asked again for the same manager and told her about that as well.  That is seriously uncalled for.  If I was Jillian's manager I would have sent her home to adjust her attitude.  I hope you are reading this Jillian because this is NOT how your treat your customer unless you want to get getting Zero to 10%tips.   Take some notes from Alex!

All in all I do love this spot.  The food is yummy and I haven't had a bad server experience until tonight.  Yes, I will return but you best believe I will not sit in Jillian's section again.  I'll save my $20 for the next server.First of all I think the sandwiches here are fantastic!!! I have been to firehouse many times now. I feel that the place is starting to lack in customer service a lot. I dont understand what is the complication to make a sandwich in this shop. Honestly their customer service sucks now. They are so slow and uncaring. 
1. two weeks ago I ordered a chicken sub plus 2 more. I payed for all sandwiches and they tell me that they are out of chicken.. ok fine.. put turkey.. Cashier says no problem she switched my  order accordingly. I did not have to pay anything extra. What I did not realize until later was that.. it was actually cheaper to get a turkey sandwich so I was overcharged. She did not bother to do a return. Nice. I waited forever to get the sandwiches..It was not any busier than a quiznos would be.
2. I ordered ONE turkey sandwich last Saturday from my house for take out. I figured since they have been slow making sandwiches.. I will call in to give them more time. I called.. and they said.. 10 minutes.. I left my house and got there in the 10 minutes.. I still had to wait an additional 20 minutes just to get a sandwich.. 30 minutes for ONE sandwich? are you kidding me? This place is really lacking on focus. I dont know if they owners realize this but I dont remember waiting 30 minutes for a sandwich anywhere EVER!!! I am real disappointed. If they were more efficient I would be there at least 2 times a week...now I am starting to not go because I dont feel like waiting so long. Maybe they need more training. I dont know if the other locations are this slow. Sandwiches.. I love them.. customer service.. not so much.Nothing special, just Shops in a Casino......only plus is they aren't as high end as the Forum Shops.Located in kind of in the walkway between Paris and Bally's, this French Bistro/Burger place sits.  It is kind of a sports bar.  The decor focuses on the color black, and the waitresses have to wear touristy corset getups.

We needed something quick, and this did do the trick.  Service was good, and food came out quick enough.  I wasn't super hungry.  I had the clam chowder and the potato skins.  I've had better, but both dishes weren't horrible.ORANGE! That is the best word I have to describe my custom airbrush tan experience. This is the first one I've been to where the girl didn't even ask how dark i wanted to go. She brought out the spray which she apologized was still cold because nobody told her about my appointment that I had booked weeks prior. TIP: Look at the person airbrushing you, if they're orange you probably will be too. Never again and two days before my best friends wedding!food was ok, not great. ambiance was directed towards older clients. cocktails boring.I gave Name Brand Exchange a second chance, but I probably won't be going back. I did find a couple of good deals the first time I went. When my mom came to visit we stopped by there and she found some things as well... But the girls that work there are the worst. The one girl that I saw both times was really irritable and when my mom asked her a question she got all sassy about it. Not cool.I was not impressed.  It's ok for a sushi bar in the middle of the desert, I suppose.  The coveted toro was blah.  It didn't melt in my mouth like the best ones do.  I enjoyed their tuna better.  The salads are a delight and the sea bass is like sugar, perhaps a little to much caramelizing.  Overall, it was OK.I returned to DOS GRINGOS MESA only to be highly offended and disgusted, The first time I went the Margaritas were awesome, this time THEY WERE SO HORRIBLE! They had a comedy night which was so horrid, and annoying! I will never revisit this bar again!My aunt and uncle came into town the other day, so I decided to take them sightseeing downtown! My uncle had to use the restroom, so we walked into the closest casino, which happened to be Fremont! When everyone was done using the restroom, my aunt saw the huge "Seafood Buffet" sign right outside of the restrooms, and that is how it began...

It was a Friday night, which meant Seafood. The seafood buffet was $20.99 per person. We were all hungry, so we made the best of it! My friend and I had a strategy... and that strategy was to ONLY EAT SEAFOOD!

The 2 stars for this review definitely goes to the Giant Crawfish! I HEART CRAWFISH! So... GUILTY, I had about 2-3 plates full of crawfish =X. There was also crab legs, which were alright, extremely small. I did enjoy the smoked salmon and fried oysters. The peeled shrimp on the other hand? They were BAD... They looked very dark, I did not even want to try them! The sushi was not good. The rice had seemed to harden from sitting in the open all day. Aside from the seafood, the rest of the food selection was very minimal.

It was then time for dessert. Luckily they had banana cream pie! It wasn't the best, but it was okay.

Overall, nothing too spectacular about this buffet. I don't think I'll be paying another $21 to eat here...Was here w/2 friends on Saturday 9/20 (at about 6pm), then again this past weekend. The visit on 9/20 was -really- good, mostly because of our server, and the food (prime rib sliders w/cheese, the buffalo chicken dip, and a burger-entree). Our server on 9/20 was very attentive, and helpful w/menu suggestions. 

Unfortunately, when my two friends and I visited on Saturday 9/25 (at 4:30pm), we had a -very- different experience. The place wasn't -that- busy, but our service took FOREVER (first water, then another 15-20min. to order drinks, then another 20min. to receive said drinks; the worst part came with paying the bill - the process of receiving the check, getting the check picked-up, and returned with receipts - 45min.). I asked the hostess as we left, she informed me a server had walked out, and our server had been working there 'only 4-weeks'. 

Completely understand that when staff walk, it creates a ripple effect, and also understand that new servers can be clunky in their delivery . . . but 4-weeks is PLENTY of time to learn to ask for help from others (at the very least other servers should have helped her). 

We -may- be back (but only because it's a convenient location for my friends)Came here today because it was the quickest way to lunch from the Hilton Grand.  It was ok.  I got the house fried rice and it was very good and a large portion for  $11.  The fried rice had pork, beef, and actually well done squid.  

The single worst experience here was the service, terrible!  it took forever to get even a menu let alone water or tea.  Definitely not going here again...Now I like a burger just like the next guy, someone please tell me why people go crazy over this place!!! Please.
Always a crowd inside and out, I just don't get it. The people that work there remind me of the Stepford Wives, little robots that smile and take orders, scary!!!

Fries, not to my liking.  Burger, not to my liking.  Experience, not to my liking.

Overall, Not to my liking.

You want a real burger, try Giant burger, you can't handle a real burger, can you?Wow, there is not a lot of love for this place. I suppose that is fitting. 

I have only been here for reverse happy hour. This is primarily because it is too freaking expensive for what you get. Sapporo right down the street has much better sushi at the same price. 

There are good things. The reverse happy hour makes it affordable, for us whose pockets aren't loaded with coin. The sushi is decent. 

One of the big faux pas of this place, I think,  is the atmosphere. Plastering the walls with huge flat panels that are flickering the latest sports event, seems to scream chicken wings and beer to me, not sushi and sake. Overall, this is not a coveted destination, but works if you are dying for mediocre sushi at Robin Leach prices. Wow.Had a machaca burrito. Tasted like pot roast, the meat was dry and chewey. Salsa was nothing special. I guess they are known for the breakfast burritos so I might give em one more shot, but I say go right down the street to Los taquitos. Never been dissapointed there.Went to Joey's on May 25 for lunch; not too crowed at noon.  Had  fish tacos served with black beans and coleslaw.  Fish was battered, fried and tasted good, but served on a flour tortilla which became a soupy, gooey mess.  They should use warm corn tortillas.  The taco filling was fairly tasteless; pico de gallo could have used some spices.  Black beans were bland; no flavor, maybe out of the can. (I d suggest a side of black beans and rice instead).   Also, since the tacos are made with coleslaw and the included side dishes are not described on the menu for this item,  the side of coleslaw was redundant.  Boring beans, flour tortillas, bland pico de gallo, redundant coleslaw = BORING FOOD!  Waitress was nice though.I have always wanted to try Nathan's hot dogs after watching them on TV......

Boy did I regret wasting my money here. Super salty and ridiculously overpriced for 1 hotdog.

Would have been better off eating at McDonalds next door if you want something to eat.Got the short ribs.  All fat!  Very disappointing.  BBQ Chicken also very fatty.macaroni salad has very little flavor.  Don't trust the multi star reviews.  This place is a bummer.Very average.  The big eye app was not fresh.  The Kobe beef carpaccio was flavorless and seemed like it might have been seared.

I left it at that before diving into a very overpriced steakLove this place. Overpriced, because I can have a strong Vietnamese woman do the same thing for about $30... But they are all very personable!

I went here because I got a gift card. I will say that you should not get water there. I have been to much cheaper salons that give me a little bottle of water. Not this one. You get a glass with ice cubes they made themselves! I like lemon in my water, but this tasted rancid for some reason and made me nauseous. No water for me.

The massage was nothing special. It was really no more than lotion that allegedly had diamonds in it being rubbed into my skin. I thought I paid for a 15 minute massage on my hands/feet each, but apparently not.Wow, this may be one of my first 2 star meals.  Probably because I was so pissed how terrible it was.

I get it.  Late at night, with a rowdy crowd, drinks, ladies and guys, who really cares about the food?  So that's why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one.

The chips and salsa were ordered (it's not free) and it wasn't bad.  I liked the different salsas and the chips were fresh.  

I had steak tacos.  I'm not looking for the absolute in authenticity.  When I saw the tacos arrive at the table I was a little bummed about flour tortillas for tacos.  But I'm game to have some flour tacos once in a while.

It was your typical "gringo" taco.  Flour tortilla, iceberg lettuce, shredded cheddar, and meat.  The meat had a good flavor, but was extremely fatty.  There were pieces of fat that I was spitting out.  

For the record, I'm not a fat-o-phobe.  Give me pork bellies, pastrami, chinese spare ribs, beef short ribs, etc.  I don't run away and demand leanness.  The meat could have been easily trimmed.  The fat really did not have any place in these tacos.  

What bothered me the most (and I'm still thinking about it) was that the taco without the meat tasted a lot like Del Taco/Taco Bell.  I'm not dramatic in my reviews, and I don't pull the "this place tasted like fast food" card unless really deserving.  I would even go as far to say that it was borderline "grody".  And I haven't used that word since I was 7.

All in all, the ambiance and "potential" gave this place 2 stars.  The prices were outrageous for what I got, even despite this being Vegas.  

With that being said, management could maybe try a little harder to make the tacos a little more memorable.  Perhaps a more rustic or hand made tortilla (flour is still ok if you must) and perhaps a sprinkle of Cotija cheese.  Trim that fat off the meat and maybe add a nice thin slice of avocado inside the taco.  Maybe a little Guajillo chile or chipotle flavor would add to the flavor profile.  

Anyways, I see this place could be a lot of fun for drinks and having a good time, but I'll pass on the food unless it's for something that you absolutely can't mess up (I think), like a quesadilla.  But anything is possible.Some of the sandwiches here are truly awesome. Some of them suck. Don't get the "Cannonballs", the meatball sandwich.  The beef tastes frozen, and I don't mind telling you, it came out both ends. 

Their cold cut sandwiches are pretty good, but the whole "fresh bread" thing is a joke..looks like frozen loafs warmed up through their conveyor driven oven. 

Not only that but the service is lackluster. I get my employee discount sometimes, sometimes I don't. I don't even bother to ask anymore, because it isn't worth the 40 cents. The sammiches are ok, but not as good as so many here claim.Average Italian food, nothing special. It is in a nice location near the fountain inside the mall though.I'm not sure if this is the best Fox restaurant. As of this week, I went into sauce twice. I found a hair in my mac and cheese the first time and then the second time I went I found another hair in my pizza. Can the cooks shave? Maybe wax? It's very displeasing to the eye.This chick fil a used to be the best, we went every week for family night on Tuesdays. Apparently it's taken over by new ownership in the last month and its just awful. The food is still decent but customer service and cleanliness is definitely lacking. The high chairs are horrifying now, which is one reason we used to like to go there, it was super clean and I didn't worry about bringing in a thousand things to sanitize my child's eating area. I'm not sure who the new owner is but he better step his game up, family get used to be super busy but it's dwindling down a lot now.Large was not so large that should be their m if not a small;( Boba kind of smoshy;( I got the aloe Boba tea it was a little too sweet for my taste and it had a little too much Boba almost half the cup full. I  don't think I would order it again.I've been to a few tea places before. This one is nothing special. They have overpriced drinks. The service wasn't that great. It took 8 minutes for them to make our drinks and it was just me and a friend in the entire store!!! We were like "How long does it take to make iced tea? It's taking quite awhile for them to hand over our drinks! what's the deal!?" 

I wouldn't mind coming back here and trying them out again. I mean, the place was really nice, clean and appropriate setting was illustrated with their decor and design. *thumbs up*My husband and I tried Cien Agaves this past week with a groupon. The groupon does not cover happy hour food/drinks so I ordered a margarita from the regular menu. $12.00 and it was all juice. My husband ordered the fried chimichanga which he absolutely loved....I ordered the seared ahi salad ($15)which was utterly disgusting. It was a large plate of a bunch of salad leafs and about 6 strips of ahi. The ahi was not pink at all... and was mushy ewww!  Obviously it was previously frozen.  Lesson learned....order mexican food when eating at a mexican restaurant.I have waited a few weeks to review this place thinking it will temper my feelings. My wife and kids were in town for a dance competition at the Paris. We walked next door to Koi and got seated right away. Funny how every place else was packed but Koi was empty. The service was very good. The wait staff were very friendly and helped us place drink orders and food orders for the kids. Not a very friendly place for food with kids, but this is Vegas. Some chicken skewers, cucumber rolls, and white rice. 

My wife and I split one of their signature rolls and she had another appetizer. I had the lamb chops. My wife had a cocktail and I had two beers. The food was very good. The reason for the low rating was for what we paid for this meal. Tax tip out the door we paid $250. This place was way over priced and I can now see why it was empty.So the Burger was good, the fries were kind of bland, but what really stood out was the bad service. I was at the airport late and hungry and this was one of the few places still open. I really wouldn't be complaining except for one indian (I think?) working there that wanted to tell us they were closed (even though another male employee had pushed us to come in) and then refused to give me a water cup larger than a shot glass. What was most annoying was that I had asked her 3 times about a larger cup, the last of which times I asked if a manager would allow it. She vehemently insisted that company policy would not allow it, but low and behold as I was walking out with my 3 tiny water cups the manager saw my predicament and offered the largest cup. I would never go back just because I would not want to have to deal with the indian lady ever again.We were here at 9 which is a bit before the late night crowd I suppose. The place was practically empty and yet we still waited an age and a day for service. 

We sat a booth not at the bar. The people sitting at the bar looked like they got served faster. 

From our vantage point we could see the place all the servers congregated. Our server would bring her order to the bar, the bartender would fill it and the server would stand around gabbing to all the other servers that were standing around for 10-15 mins AFTER her drinks had been made by the bartender. Then she would deliver them.

Here's a scenario for you. We sat for 15 minutes before she approached us for our order. We waited another 10 before our drinks were brought out to us. We gave her a very nice tip. And then sat another 45 minutes without her ever coming back to ask if we wanted another round. I don't know about you, but where I come from my milkshake usually brings the boys to the yard... but not this time.We arrived hoping to have a true "old Las Vegas" experience, but it was more akin to to episodes of GR's Kitchen Nightmares.  The theme is familiar, a once great restaurant now tired, dusty and dated.  Once exquisite cuisine now tasted and had the texture of day old left overs.  If it wasn't for the extremely attentive service, I would have given it one star.  The food quality although beautifully presented, was extremely lacking.  Update the decor without losing the character and please return to fresh foods not thaw and reheats.I've been to the location in Tempe, which is typically pretty good. This one was terrible. We ordered the "pot stickers"... supposedly precooked and then pan fried. I will tell you that the chicken was raw and the dough was chewy. We made one complaint, and the waitress assured us that they were "cooked." Then after cutting into another, the chicken continued to be under done and pink. We sent those back, and waited at least another 20 minutes for our main meal. That was just mediocre -The Southwest Chicken sandwich. 

Will say the beer was good as usual.I saw Mark Rich's Groupon promo in my inbox one morning and decided to give it a go--bad choice. The service was straight up horrendous. 

We ordered a Caesar salad which was tasty, but then waited for 30 more minutes on a spinach calzone. 30 minutes for a single spinach calzone. 

You gotta love open kitchens, because it was wonderful watching the cooks giggle and flirt with each other, slowly assembling meals for the handful of tables and take out orders they had. All the while, the manager casually enjoyed his red wine, slowly sipping the night away. Seriously, it felt like an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. Get off your bar stool and manage!!

The apathetic waitress walked passed our table several times, ignoring our empty beer mugs and discontented faces until I shouted out twice to ask how much longer we'd have to wait. The single calzone arrived and tasted good. But I don't like to wait around and be ignored all night for just good.

And wouldn't you know it? That waitress got so smiley and attentive as soon as the check came. You would have thought she was in the running for Miss America.Before coming in to dine here we all read the Yelp reviews which show 2.5 stars over 76 reviews and went in anyway ?@#^&%@$  

They were all correct... Over priced for marginal quality with slow service. We decided to go for the experience and to say we had eaten at Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville. 

Maybe the best plan if you wanted to "experience it" is to go for drinks and possibly appetizers, listen to some music and then go across the walkway to Yard House to eat.

If you were wasted in Margaritaville the bad food and high prices would not bother you. ... so who knows.. maybe that IS the marketing plan! 

No one was happy with their order, it was slow and not really very appealing.... that being said.. we won't ever be back.  

The music was fun we saw some AZ Cardinals eating there but the food not so much! Won't be back.Though this restaurant has great decor and is very interesting to look at, we felt it was way overpriced for the food that you receive. The club sandwich was dry and the fries were oversalted. At best the food was just okay, but we were disappointed with the prices. For the type of food that is served, it is significantly higher than other restaurants that have similar menus.No. Do. Not. Order the brownie.The food is pretty much inedible. After dark it turns into a hot, sweaty, ugly, trashy dance fest of scary people...who want to fight...or worse yet...fuck.

Two stars because it is possible to day drink here and survive. But for the love of god as soon as the sun goes down run. RUN!While the food is good, and the drinks aren't bad, the service is terrible.

First time I was there, I sat at the bar with a friend.  While I ran to the bathroom, he ordered a drink and 2 waters- telling the bartender I would be right back to order a drink also.  When I got back, not a single bartender came my way or would even make eye contact with me for a good 10 minutes.  We literally had to walk around to the other side just to get someones attention. This went on the entire time we were there, whether we were trying to order more drinks, or food.  I should mention also, that this was about 3pm on a tuesday - there were only 2 other groups at the bar.

On my next visit, we asked for a table.  The hostess kept insisting that we should just go to the bar, but finally caved in and gave us a table when we were persistent.  When she asked if we wanted a booth or table we requested a table so we could see the tv's.  She then told us we couldn't have a table in that section and sat us in a booth where we couldn't see anything.  Once again, it was nearly 10 minutes before our server came by to take orders, and didn't even give us a chance to give our food orders before rushing off with just our drink orders.  It was a long meal...

So anyway, if you don't mind crap service and long wait times between drinks, this is the place for you.  However, if you want to get more than 1 drink in per 45 minutes avoid here at all costs.The food was good nothing to go crazy over they did however bring out a bean dip with the salsa that was very good & different from most places. The decour was fitting for a mexican restaurantNot impressive.  Adequate service, but for the price the menu items lacked attention to detail. No guarana.  Feijoada is not very authentic.   Pao de queijo a bit heavy.  Meats were a little bland in flavor. Salad bar had good variety, though.  A little limited selection in the meats compared to other similar Brazilian steakhouses.We sat in the bar after work one day for dinner. My husband ordered the osso bucco and I had the Frutti di Mare. My pasta was ok, nothing special, but the osso bucco was utterly disappointing. The saffron orzo was bland and the osso bucco was dry with no sauce. For the price we were paying and the Mario Batali name, we were so underwhelmed.I've heard amazing reviews about this place so I tried it out for a gel manicure. The place is very trendy and I absolutely love how it is decorated. I was brought to a shelve with a ton of gel it's to choose from.. So that was cool. The lady who did my nails was friendly enough. The gel manicure itself wasn't done well at all. You could see through my nails and on the sides which I didn't realize until I got home. It was a little pricey as well. I'm sure ill be back, especially to try their pedicure. But I can find better service and product for cheaper when it comes to a gel maniureNot that great. Food is sub par. I am always cold when I go.Cheap happy hour, good location, ok food, ok drinks, awful service. 7 of 8 visits the service was terrible. Go check out the crowd, grab a drink then go anywhere else for a nice evening.The Big Blue (Chicken) Burrito was remarkably tasteless. The only reason I gave this place 2 stars was the prices are good and the food seemingly fresh. Good luck in Concourse C...you're going to need it.I went there for one of my friends' bachelor party and go-kart was good but the staff were kinda rude I thought.   I wasn't wearing a seat belt correctly initially and the way they tell you to do stuff are just plain rude.   Excuse me but not all of us are pro go-kart racers and Vegas is a tourist place so they better start some employee training soon before they lose customers.It looks alot better than it tastes...

When I first saw this place.. I was in heaven..  It's great how they present everything..

They have alot of stuff there..  We tried a crepe with gelato.

The crepe was just OK.. for the price.. and my expectations based on the look of this place was...it was a letdown.  The gelato was OK as well.
This place isn't cheap. You're in the palazzo, and expected to pay top dollar.

The chocolate syrup used was mediocre.  I would go back to try something else though.. something HAS to be good.. right??It was there and so were we.  It was getting late and we wanted to dance.  The music was fine.  The crowd, ok.  It was only a $5 cover, thank god :)I have to start with an old UK Joke. 

"How did you find the steak and kidney pie? "   

"I moved a chip...  

The plusses. They have hard cider:) The chips are not those evil stringy jokes  that  pass for fast food places "or the  crisp and crunchy variants they are pretty  close to decent home made chips  but  having grown up in the uk and eating this for  3-4 years during college   ( and they wonder why Scots have the most heart disease  outside of  New Orleans:))   this is  not just like home.    

 This is still very much  fish and chips at the "sit down"   rather than take out level. E.g   They are adequate but  didn't kick me back  nostalgia wise and  so far in the US I've not found decent ( aka bad:)  UK food that didn't come out of one or two suppliers  in the states and was lovingly heated to the same directions. 

The steak and kidney pie, holy heck it was lame. I'm eating offal here so you have to give me some credit for knowing when the piss is being taken.   It's not an fully enclosed pie like they would serve in the UK which is finger food meant to be consumed on the move which doesn't describe this 80% crust to filling ratio at all.

This needs a fork, and  not that big a one cos three  trawls of the pieplate was all I  got out of it.  So far the only place that has gotten remotely  close to UK pastry  is the  Cornish pastie co in Tempe. Seriously this alone took it from 3 to 2 stars.If it cost $2 more but actually contained the advertised ingredients in identifiable lumps I'd be happier as it is less insulting  in the long run. 

Nearly everyone else fakes it  and cooks a filling, then crust and marries them later  to heat. Having ketchup in packets is just bloody annoying, not having brown sauce out  likewise.     

Hint  Cross the road. Go to the Indian grocery , to their freezer  section and get their steak and kidney pie /  steak pie /  any pie   , Go to Codfather for chips,  stick the two together.Yes, it's free, but so are those cheesy Greek robot performers at Ceasar's. 

The show starts at 6 and runs every hour on the hour.  To be honest I think the best part is that on a cold night you can feel the warmth from the fire, but you can also stay warm inside the casino, which is where I will stay next time.I love love loooove cold stone.  It's our first destination when we decide that we want ice cream.  I don't know what it is about this location...the service is always so...I don't want to say horrible...but it's always awkward.  The staff just kind of continues to talk amongst themselves when you enter the store...as if they don't know why you're in there.  We always ride our bikes to the store being that we live nearby, and we always ask that we can take it to go.  After we request it to go, the hand it to us, open top and a spoon.  Then we have to ask them for each individual thing...we have to ask for lids...then we have to ask for a bag.  Either way, we'll always go back because they serve ice cream...but it's just like a hard core awkward off in there.What in the world happened here???

I was in Vegas the last half of the week of St. Patrick's Day, and got in touch with an old college friend who lives there.  So, we decided to meet up for dinner on Friday night.  We talked on Thursday night to decide where to eat.  I ended up picking Restaurant Charlie because it was on my bookmarked list of places to try (I've heard about Charlie Trotter's in Chicago), it had 1 Michelin star from 2009, & it was located in the hotel I was staying in (convenient for car-less me).  He called & made reservations for Friday night at 6pm while I was still on the phone with him.  

Well, we were going to meet there, since he was coming from work, so I walked down shortly before 6pm, only to find the door to the restaurant locked.  I was completely confused, so, I thought maybe there's an entrance from the outside.  I tried to figure that out while I texted my friend to let him know what was going on.  He arrived shortly after, & we flagged down staff at the Palazzo to discover that the restaurant was closed.  So, did they close after my friend called & made reservations the night before?  Or did my friend end up talking to some other place & making reservations there inadvertently?  I'm not sure what happened there.  We didn't get a call or warning or anything.  

Anyway, the story has a happy ending (for us)...we ended up having a fantastic meal at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (maybe a review coming soon?).

I don't even know how to rate this review!This Chick Fil A is awful. The last 3 times I have been here I have gotten soggy fries that are undercooked. How do you consistently mess up fries?? I love chick fil A but this location sucks. I've learned my lesson and I just have to drive up to North Scottsdale to get my fix.One thing I'm a stickler for is definitely Brazillian food. I know my Brazillian from having an ex and bf who introduced me to it. I can cook it most definitely. I was at Sushi Samba for a party and they had passed apps which were great. Great sushi, great crab cakes, awesome skewers of beef...But mind you passed apps. 
The drinks....amazing. As far as the Samba Juice. This is the only place in town I know that mixes with Acai berrys. Which give a unique chocolate hint to a blueberry flavor. Definitely high in antioxidents.
But I came here for brunch with a friend. 
Now I sat at the bar and we ordered drinks. She ordered the Pomelo...but they didnt't have any. So then the Cucumber. I had the Samba Juice again. I decided to order Churros because I LOVE HOME MADE CHURROS. Too bad I didn't get them. Grrr they took forever. I also ordered food to go. Feijoada, chorizo, linguisa(kinda portuguese sausage) and some peruvian corn which is like giant hominy. 
Well the order was wrong because I ordered sides and  he asked me how I wanted my eggs. The bartender was really slow. I asked him some questions on why he was shaking a certain way and he said it was because they put egg whites in the drink. I explained a different method on how to make the drink that he won't tire himself out and he said "No it's better my method" LOL I asked him where he worked before and he said..."Grand Lux Cafe" Yea Nuff said. I didn't introduce myself to him because he was too hard headed in knowing what was right and wrong. So he fcked up my order, returned the Churros when I asked him for it to go, and then he stiffs me on eggs on the bill. Yea I'm gonna order from the table next time. I think brunch is for rookies. 
The Feijoada was very....thick....the Chorizo and Linguisa with Hominy was delicious. They don't make it home made but they get it in Cali from this spanish place I know. 
Over all drinks are good. But I guess the staff being not so bueno made me drop the score down a lil.Circus Circus has one of the most tragic buffets in Vegas.  (Probably next to that Railroad Casino buffet.  Please see my review for a detailed description of that hot mess.)  Luckily, my dad got enough points to comp part of this meal.  Otherwise, I woulda opted to eat at the Auntie Ann's or a Nathan's hot dog.  Or a bag of chips.  Or a Red Bull.  

It's like Old Country Buffet, basically.  There were some highlights - like the mashed potatoes and jello.  But...that's about it.  I think the interior is exactly the same as it was when I was 9 and came here for the first time.  Pass!I'm 30.  That makes me at least five years too old to be on Mill Avenue to bar hop on a Saturday night (unless you're a transient).  Although I have to admit that I enjoy stopping by every few months for the nostalgic value.  It brings me back to my college days at ASU even though most of the places I frequented back then are gone.

Mill is a great place to go get something to eat.  Maybe even hit up a bar or two after a football or basketball game.  But if you're no longer of college age.  You may want to avoid it at all costs.This place is such an easy target, its like piling on the fat, pimply kid in high school.  Here's what you need to know

1.  Girls in uniform with things out that you can sadly and quite accidentally observe
2.  They have hamburgers, hot dogs, and beer
3.  Beer is PBR or the Champagne of Beers.  No other choices.
4.  Diner style seating, long high tops, patios with umbrellas
5.  Three high quality HD LCD screens in a decent, elevated spot.
6.  There will be some shiesty characters present. 
7.  Don't go here with your girlfriend.

Their screens and ironic selection of beers earns 'em two stars.I would seriously give this place a 5 had my last two experiences not been so dismal. This place has a great Kobe burger and is nicely placed in the casino with a great DJ who's songs you can hear from the bar next door...but the service is a whole other story.

On my last trip we went to Brand as a table of 6. It was not even busy, maybe four tables and they had two servers. My guess is they were understaffed as they were also probably taking care of the bar. Anyhow, we ordered appetizers and drinks and the appetizers came out twenty minutes before the food. THEN, they brought the food out at separate times for each person and the waitress was getting a little too friendly and joking a little too much with the table. Overall, we were in good company but I don't think I'll make it a point to come back here...Food and service were excellent, but the techno music blasting in an endless loop made it almost impossible to have a conversation and forced us to rush through dinner, leaving with headaches. Maybe just not our scene, but won't be back.I loved the inside of this salon, very comfortable yet stylish. So I was excited as I waited, thinking I would walk out with the best highlights and cut. I paid over $350 for a trim and highlights. She didn't go as light as I wanted...she was about 3 shades off, which barley made any difference in my then, brown hair. It was awkward the whole time because she never once spoke unless to ask me a question or to say she's sorry for pulling on my hair. For a "so called" color expert, she disappointed me greatly. I will not return, even after receiving the coupons that I just threw away.They take reservations but apparently it's up to the manager to make sure your party has seating or not.  Worst service ever.This review is a prime example of how bad service can taint good food. If I could give 2.5 stars I would. I really wanted to rate this restaurant at a much higher rating. 

I took my boyfriend here to celebrate his birthday a few days early. We arrived at around 7:30 and the place was packed. I should have made a reservation because we walked in and the line of people waiting at the hostess table was almost out the door. We waited to be greeted by the hostess for about 5 minutes before we could give her our names. At first, both of the hostesses were polite and told us that a table for two had about a 10-15 minute wait, so we stood in the waiting area because there were no more seats available. About 20-25 minutes go by and we still hadn't been called up. We went back to the hostess station and asked the girls what was going on. Somehow, they ended up not taking our name down, so we were never added on their wait list. When we asked them how much longer from that point, they told us 35-40 minutes, despite the fact that we had already been waiting. Their excuse was that the kitchen was working at capacity. Yeah. I understand. But if the kitchen is working at capacity, then why did she offer for us to sit at the full-service bar? Sounded like a poorly-constructed excuse devised to cover up a mistake. We sucked it up, gave them our name and made sure they had it this time, and went back to standing. Other groups and couples kept walking in and were being seated immediately. I was so frustrated that I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to leave and go somewhere else, but he said no so we just walked around the Kierland area. 

After about 20 minutes, we got a text saying our table was ready. We walked back, and were seated outside. Our waitress came to take our drink order, and having had so much linger-time before we were seated, we already knew what we wanted to order, so we ordered the Pig pizza as an appetizer along with two Diet Cokes to drink. She came back immediately with two water glasses, but no Diet Coke. In the meantime, we asked for some bread and infamous sun-dried tomato butter to snack on. Five minutes had gone by and she stopped by our table with nothing, and simply told us that the bartender was backed up-- this seemed to be the excuse of the evening all night. I mean, how hard is it to really fill up a couple of soda glasses. Five minutes later, she came back with our drinks, but no bread. It took her about another 2 minutes for bread. 

Right after the bread came, our pizza came. It was absolutely delicious. The meats were so flavorful, the crust was the perfect consistency and thickness, and the sauce was amazing. Even though this place isn't technically a "pizzeria," I think their pizza was better than LGO's Gladiator (similar pizza with two types of sausage).  In the meantime, we ordered our main courses. I got the spaghetti, and he got the short rib gnocchi. 

About 10 minutes after finishing the pizza the main courses came out. My spaghetti was really really good. The pasta, almost similar to a bucatini, was not like most traditional spaghettis. The noodles themselves were thick (larger diameter), and cooked to al-dente perfection. The pasta wasn't swimming in sauce, and similar to the pizza sauce, was very nicely flavored. My boyfriends gnocchi on the other hand was a complete disaster. I seriously cannot explain how unappetizing it was. The short ribs were apparently really good, but the sauce that it came in was SO bitter. I pretty much just dipped my fork in the sauce and didn't want to eat any more of it. After about 3 bites, we ended up having to send it back. We waited a bit, talked to the manager (I'm assuming), and eventually the other dish came out. It was actually pretty good. I can't remember what it was called but it had chicken, spinach, pine nuts and pasta all together. By this time (9:30 ish) the restaurant was starting to clear out. The waitress was nice enough to comp us an apple crumble dessert (that was truly delicious) because we were celebrating his birthday. We ate it, paid about $55 for the whole meal, and left 2 1/2 hours later. All together, the food was really good, but the service was really, really lackluster. 

If the service was even just a little bit better, this place would have gotten four stars in my book. At this point, I'm not too sure if I'd be back or not. Maybe I'll venture out on a day that seems to be less crowded, where all the staff can keep up with demands.Service could really use some improvement. Maybe a smile or two would be great. I mean, it was our first time and we definitely smiled at her & she enthusiastically (not) walked us to a booth.

Anyway, thought the food would save the icky service but I was wrong. It was.. alright. Nothing special & I've definitely had better. I ordered the Sizzling Beef Hibachi.. which was definitely not sizzling when it got to our table. Actually, it wasn't even warm, except for the rice. Also, my supposed-to-be sizzling plate barely had meat. I'm sure I didn't order Veggie Hibachi. Sigh. Food wasn't terrible but it wasn't anything special & portions were ehhh. 

I probably won't be back. Oh well.. on to the next Japanese spot.I've been here before and the food was ok and since this place is local I decided to try one more time just in case I missed something, but now I'm really turned off by this place. The quality is not good; wasabi and ginger plate I received was all dried up, the cucumber salad they served tasted like it was prepared a couple of days ago and to top it off, when the guy served us the cucumber salad he had one finger in the salad ( not cool ). I sat at the bar and asked the guy making sushi what he suggested to eat, he grabbed the menu from me to point something out then went back to making the sushi roll without washing his hands. MENUS CAN BE ONE OF THE FILTHIEST  THINGS IN A RESTAURANT. Another thing, the batter on the tempura shrimp looked and tasted old. After all that I ate my sushi rolls with some hesitation. There are other sushi places  that trump this place so  from now on I will drive further and even pay more to get better quality. 

Just gave them 2 stars:
1 star cause the people were nice and
1 star cause food did not make me sick.Service, slow and it was empty. Took 15 min. To get drinks!
Burgers were dry. Bread tasted old. The fries had a weird taste to them. Maybe undercooked? Only thing good was the rings. Much prefer Fuddruckers.

Such a disappointment as we use to go to the one in Florida all the time and it was good!Meh.... 

Let's start with the positives:  Our server was friendly and awesome.  The cornbread served in the cast iron pan was rustic and fresh (piping hot from the oven).  The food presentation was pretty and appealing.  The ambience was rustic, but the place was bustling -- but I went on Black Friday.  It probably isn't usually this crazy.  The prices are middle of the road.

The negatives:  Too bad the food did not taste as good as it looked.  Everything seemed to need some salt and they used the same slaw in the ahi bites appetizer as in the fish tacos I ordered.  This homogenous taste experience left much to be desired.  Why they serve fish tacos rolled in a gummy flour tortilla is a mystery.  If you are going to serve a rolled taco, it better be a fresh corn tortilla.  The gummy flour tortilla stuck to my teeth and top of my mouth.   I ate 2 pieces this way and eventually just took my fork and gutted the two remaining pieces and the experience was much better.

I guess I am used to real Mexican food and enjoy good Cali-Mex and Tex-Mex.  However, this place would not qualify as good in my book.  I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.

My sister chose this restaurant.  I definitely will not return on my own volition.I've only been here once but the time I went, I felt the food was a bit expensive for what we got. It's not bad and the staff is incredibly nice, but it didn't impress me in particular.

Also, when when I ordered the egg roll and asked how many pieces we get, the server told me 8. When the eggroll came, it was just two eggrolls cut into 8 tiny pieces. Haha...what the hell.I hope the hour and half wait for the food is well worth it since we are sitting next to the kitchen door watching the group getting served as plates after plates come scrolling by.... Not even busy. 
Not much seafood options unless it's drenched in coconut...... Still  waiting still waiting. ....
The kids meal finally came. 
Waiting. ... waiting. ... that looks good! Waiting. .....
For the price of what you get and the taste, this place is not worth a second try.Had dinner with my friends because 2 of them had a deal from group on so we all decided that's fine we're willing to try out new places. Of course we're lagers and was late thought we would've had to wait even though we had reservations as soon as we parked the car and walked up it was empty but was understandable because it was during EDC weekend. The atmosphere was suppose to be dimmed but it was super dark in there.

Sat down and looked at the menu & there's not really much items .. I was feeling like a steak would satisfy my hunger so I order the fillet Mignon my rating for that eh.. its okay I guess. I had also order a side of grilled asparagus all of that including my friends orders took them a whole hour just to bring out our food, I looked around and thought man it's pretty busy for them since its taking so long but nope there was only 7 people in there not including the group I went with & the workers .. wthell really?

Finally our food came out .. I was pretty excited to fulfill my hunger man was I so disappointed. The grilled asparagus sucked so bad it was burnt  and the steak was alright like I had mention before, I had better. The mashed potatoes .. no comment. The meat loaf .. gag sorry to say. The dessert was little zinger looking cupcake bites & cotton candy something different but cotton candy really? For a 'high end looking restaurant' they're super cheap with the dessert can't even serve ice cream or something .. 

My overall review : will I go back there? NOPE.  

no wonder they had a deal on group on ..Food was OK, but the service sucked today. We have been to this Claim Jumper and the one in Henderson multiple times, but this place sucked today. Luisa, our server, seemed like someone pissed in her cheerios. We were the second group of people in the place. 2-3 other families got their appetizers before we did. Also, timing is key when eating at a restaurant. When our appetizers come out as well as our soup and salad, then 5-10 minutes later the main course come out. Seriously? We barely even got to finish. Claim Jumper has lost our business and we will never go back. Tip was less than 10% because of this service.Not impressed. Better Indian to be had, but probably not on this side of town.Everything was awesome but there is one very big exception. If you are staying at the Encore ask if the Surrender night club is active! The music was so loud it vibrated our beds until 4 AM.  So in a nutshell no matter how nice a hotel is if you can't sleep a motel 6 is a better choice.They have been messing it up lately.  I havent been back for months.  Having the wagging tits in your face with the big smiles and what are you doing today is starting to get old.  Everyone is obviously forced to make conversation and to start by asking what are you guys up to today?  Come on you guys it starts to feel like an intrusion and we know its forced which is why its becoming uncomfortable.  You guys are doing everything else right.  Lose the forced buddy buddy stuff that is now starting to work against you and let conversation happen naturally instead.  Last few times my coffee wasnt right so now I just make it at home.Great business if you like sitting in a chair for hours. I had an eye problem and went to the Ahwatukee office for an afternoon appointment, my kids in tow. After waiting a while, they told me the doc was dealing with an emergency and would be delayed. I completely understood. After a COUPLE HOURS I tried to reschedule and while the staff was very kind, they wouldn't let me reschedule. They kept saying, just a little longer. My kids were hungry for dinner so I said I was leaving, so they hurried me into an exam room and left me there a while longer! I sat there and listened to my doctor in the next room do a whole appointment with another patient. Obviously he wasn't ready for me like the staff said. But finallly, I got the care I needed and it helped. I feel like the doctor really listened to me. So, a few months later, 2 days ago, I went for my follow up at the Tempe office for a MORNING appointment. I got there 15 minutes early, but was not seen by the assistant for at least 1/2 hour after my appointment time. Then I got processed in by the medical assistant, and was put in an exam room. An hour and 5 minutes after my scheduled appointment, I walked out. I told the receptionist my name, and that I was leaving because I had been waiting so long. She just said, "Alright." I was furious; my day off was shot, no apologies, no explanation. I know doctors have emergencies, but that must not have been the case here. I am incensed at the lack of customer service. Each individual person I dealt with at both offices was very nice, but the entire office system at both offices is inconsiderate of my time. I am a consumer and I would not stand for this behavior at a restaurant or a store. I believe they should have told me, on both occasions, "We're running at least 45 minutes late. Would you like to reschedule?" Unless you need one of these physicians for their particular specialty, vote with your feet. Walk away. Unless you really like sitting for hours and being disregarded.The BLT Burger was okay.  I just came back from Las Vegas last night. On Friday, I was looking for the restaurant and it was hard to locate at first. There were nobody standing in line so I decided to try it out. I saw several reviews and they say it was the bomb. It was okay.Why does this man have a club in Vegas!?!  

This club is small, with one dancefloor and a small patio in the back.  Drinks are standard, but they couldn't make our scooby snacks cuz they had no whipped cream... The guys are less scandalous than the guys you'd find in Tao, but some of them were definitely more creepy.  I was busy rejecting this one guy when he told me that he liked being rejected by me.  That's when I took it as my cue to run to my guy friend and and beg, "save me, save me, save me..."Let me preface by saying the store is a cool little store for dogs but..........Probably an off day today or something but we came to this location last year while on vacation and the staff was fantastic...friendly, gave attention to our little guy and let us try a sample behind the counter...then we purchased a good amount of treats and toys.  This tiime the staff didn't even say hi...i guess the reason why we pay so much for the treats is not because of quality but for the friendly interaction b/w us and the store...my dog would be just as happy with a twenty five cent treat from petsmart then a $2 specialty treat from Just Dogs....I always give places 2nd chances but if i get the same customer service as this last time I probably wouldn't spend my money there again.Too crowded and music was questionable...I don't really understand what all the hype is over this place. When I walked in there everything looked prepackaged by some mass industry. Most of the stuff there is overpriced compared to places like sprouts and even trader Joe's. Occasionally there are some decent values there but  not worth the trip. This place is literally on the corner where I live but I don't shop there. I also feel like they are lacking a certian level of variety that I desire in a store.While the food was OK, the service definitely left something to be desired. We had multiple people serving our party, which made it confusing as to who we could actually ask when we needed something. The initial waitress was friendly and helpful but after she delivered our first round we lost sight of her. Our second server we all mistook for the bus boy, and as it turns out was a far more accurate description. After about three people ordered drinks his eyes glossed over and he admittedly couldn't even remember the second persons drink. We would have valued his honesty if he had not also been visibly irritated that such a large group dare order from him. 

The service rant aside, Bogey's hosts a pretty fun trivia night and there specials are plentiful and worthwhile. The bar is large and spacious offering outdoor seating and shuffleboard ( a personal favorite of mine). While I wouldn't go out of my way to frequent this semi dive bar, if that's where to group wants to go, I wouldn't object.In Surprise this is probably the best Chinese offering which isnt saying a whole lot. I really wish there was an awesome offering out there in terms of Chinese food.. Mexican food, oh yeah, some very good places mostly but Asian, youre better off staying at home and cooking. 

We ordered the Asian Chicken Salad, chicken was old and had that old gross fridge taste.. Dan Dan Noodle, the noodles were over cooked and stuck together as one large soggy noodle.. Curry with Tofu, the curry had a weird perfume taste.. the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers. 

With Surprise having so many chains it wasnt surprising to see one of these finally opening up.. a far better choice than Panda Express.. kind of sad, huh?Rice was too dry, service was slow at best and for what we got the price was way to high. The decor was nice though but I can get better sushi from albertsons for a fraction of the cost.I needed to eat something. Anything. Nothing that wasn't fast food was open at 11 am. Benihana's looked nice but it wasn't open. I walked around and there was a line to order. There was definitely a wine by the glass vending machine that you had to use your hotel card or something to part take. Can't say I've ever seen that before. They served coffee, sandwiches, wraps, pastries, etc. The gent in front of me was irritated that they were out of parfaits. He needed three of them and I guess I'm assuming by his irritation that he called before hand. I ordered some shrimp pasta container that was served cold. The one on display looked disgusting and the get behind the counter assured me mine would be fresh. It was OK. There was some weird glaze on the shrimps that was weird but consumable. I was basically served cold linguine pasta with a few pieces of of lettuce and five reject-like shrimps. I wanted an Arnold Palmer. Nope. Couldn't get that either. But they did have iced tea. So I just went with that. Those two items came to $14. 

I'd say there were enough tables but when I was done, I didn't see a trash can to dispose of my food. So I left it on the table. As I was leaving the casino, my plate was still there. Bus boy?My whole night at Sushi Roku was full of "I should have known better...."

I should have known better to not trust the front desk folks at my hotel to make a restaurant recommendation..... should have  trusted YELP

I should have known better that trendy and hip don't always equal quality dinning .... should have consulted YELP 

I should have known better ... when the hostess tells you 30 minutes for the next table and you don't get seated after waiting for a good 45 minutes, its time to get the hell out ..... YELP would have saved me 

I should have known better .... when you're waiting for a table and you see a sea full of empty tables that the restaurant could care less if you are waiting or not ..... god YELP me 

I should have known better when the restaurant never seats you at a table, keeps making up excuses as to why you can't sit down, you find a bug in your drink and they only comp you for part of your bill .... its time to give that place a big YELPIN review

Ok so bottom line ... 
Sushi Roku is a trendy place in Scottsdale, its kind of hip.. but again you're in Scottsdale 

I should have known better and left restaurant after being told it would take 30 minutes to get a table.  But instead I decided to take my chances and that was my bad. 

The saving graces of the night was my dinner party, and the very helpful and wonderful waiter STAN.  Stan allowed me to give Roku an extra star.  

Sum it up:
Roku ain't worth it... move onHonestly I wasn't all that impressed with this place.
Pretty limited menu, the portions are tiny, and they charge for salsa (which was mediocre).

The signs boast the best carne asada in the valley.  Not sure what valley they are talking about, but definitely not the best in phoenix.  Although it was good, I would put it at about average for carne asada.

The location was great and the building was kind of cool, but the seating was very limited and there seemed to be some wasted space.  

All in all, I thought the food was okay, but overpriced for what you get.I've noticed that a lot of my yelp's begin with 'i went on a date here once' ...and this is no different...

So, I went on a date here once! The first thing that struck me was the size - it is huge! But really nicely decorated. It looks out onto the canal (yeah, I didn't know there was a canal in Edinburgh either) and has a lovely outdoor seating area.

BUT..... I've been a few times at the weekend and it's always absolutely dead! There is no atmosphere and hardly anybody there! As a result all the drinks were extortionately priced - but as I was on a date I didn't have to pay (score!) . The mojito's were good....not the best but ok, definitely not worth £8 each.

Overall, it's a nice place but has no atmosphere. If you like a bit of life in a bar, don't hit Cargo!Visited this restaurant one night and it was pretty quiet.  For a restaurant with prime location on the Royal Mile, I would have expected it to be busier, especially on bank holiday weekend.  There were two other tables occupied and we were invited to sit anywhere we wanted.  It's a odd space arrangement, the kitchen is at the door which provides a narrow eating area along side it or else you venture to the back where there is more space.  The room temperature is a bit crazy here too, it was nice and cosy at the wall, but there was a cool draft down the centre of the space.  So we moved early on to find a cosier table before ordering. 

I ordered the ham, spicy pepperoni, onion and mushroom pizza and the my friend, a pasta (forgot what exactly, but in the menu is stated "go on give it a try")!  The pizza arrived and was a good size, but sadly the base was cooked underneath, but the top was still soggy.  Flavour wise, it was good, much better that my companions over salty pasta dish.  I wasn't all that impressed and the interior is basic and dated.  The restaurant is dependant on tourist who don't know better.  Expected more from a restaurant on Royal Mile, there are better Italian restaurants out there... Go a bit further a field and got to La Favorita, in Leith.As with a previous yelper, I was attracted to the Malt Shovel because of their beautiful hanging-baskets outside. Yeah, I realize that sounds a bit uncool for a 20 year old, but I was with my mum and she likes those sorts of things. 

The pub was what you would expect from an Edinburgh/British pub. Very pleasant, very nice atmosphere and lovely staff, but pretty average to be honest. Their wine was quite warm - Heinous crime in my opinion - and they didn't have any Pimms so I wasn't all that satisfied with the overall experience. But it was nice to sit outside and watch the world go by (not that much of the world passes Cockburn Street).This place is full of opposites.

It's a warm, welcoming atmosphere (from the buzz of chat, the piano and the smell of food) accompnied by some of the nastiest service I have ever experienced from a mamber of staff who so clearly thought I didnt belong in the Living Room that I'm suprised she didnt just come right out and say it.

The food is expensive and very nicely presented - but you either get it on a great day and the food is delicious or it is bland and tastless. Worst thing is, there is no way of telling which day is which.

The most annoying thing however, is the clientel of this place. You get (as you may have noticed from the other reviews of this place), the Edinburgh Elite mixing with people who just want some nice food and a drink. Mixing those two together isnt a great mix as at least on the side of the non-elitist's its more than a bit uncomfortable.Very ordinary. Don't believe the hype. We summed it up: "Anyone who can succinctly explain to me what it is that I'm missing with Chop Chop would be welcomed with open arms. For me it's totally ordinary, completely mediocre, bland and inoffensive, much like their food. I just can't see what it is that inspires the level of adulation it attracts."A ship which is a bar, restaurant and music cellar. 

No reviews yet, shame. So all the people that I usually see on the Cruz don't seem to bother about reviews on Yelp - or are there no Yelpers going to the Cruz? 
Anyway this ship is a less of a hit and mostly miss for me. 
They have a brilliant location and a fantastic venue and why oh why don't I like it?. 
I want to! especially in the summer when you can have the sun (if..) on the deck the whole day. There are no comfertable chairs on the deck and it has an 'ramshackle' outdoor bar thingy.. but when the sun is out it is packed.

The restaurant has not been visited anytime I passed. Can't comment on that. 
The inside of the Cruz is .. a ship's lounge. 
there is a grand Piano and all is a well kept. I can't say anymore really as most of the time for me it was a bit .. meh.Totally dont uunderstand this place........at all....!

Are you a Mexican restaurant....are you a pub......what are you? The food is ok - the wine is questionable for the price - ther service is ok.

Its just a bit pointless - great location going to waste in my opinion.Neat idea but over priced and the drinks were not that great. I am glad we went but I wouldn't go again.It had a nice vibe, but the food was less than mediocre.

The appetizer was dried out chicken, and for the main course, I asked the server what the signature dish was, and she steered me to the pork shoulder.  Instead of the succulent, moist, mouth watering vision I had in mind, it was dried out as well.  Didnt finish even half of it.  

Maybe our problem was that we were dining after 10pm on a weekend, and they weren't as mindful as they should have been.  But for the prices they charge, there is no excuse for the lack of execution.

The scene was cool, but I wouldn't go back to eat.BARF! Gave it a extra star for the ambiance and decor that was the only thing this restaurant had going for itself.Really disappointed.  It was our anniversary dinner (12 years yay!), we ate out on the patio.  The atmosphere was very nice, wonderful weather, quiet, enjoyable in that respect.  However, I ordered the prime rib and prawns, and my husband ordered the ribeye.  He said his ribeye was good, but no better than Texas Roadhouse.  It said it was served with rice pilaf, which it wasn't it was wild rice.  My prime rib was horribly overcooked and dry, although had nice flavor, and my prawns were undercooked, but again good flavor.  I did eat the prawns the way they were, but could not choke down the steak being so over done, so I said something.  One of our waitresses (we were passed back and forth between 3), siad she'd get me a new one.  They did bring a new one which was cooked correctly, however it was still dry and this one had no flavor at all.  I don't EVER spend $30 on an entree for myself and was very disappointed that this was such a let down after so many friends had raved over it.  Our calamari appetizer was good.  Our drinks were only refilled once and glasses sat empty for a good long time.  After the prime rib was replaced, that was that, nothing off the tab, no apology, no dessert on the house, NOTHING.  

For what we paid, the food was just okay and definitely not worth the high price tag by any means.  I doubt we will return in the future.  The only reason I would choose here over something like Texas Roadhouse would be the atmosphere, but even at that, I far prefer better food at a better price with better service over atmosphere.Dos estrellas.

My review has been fed into Yahoo! Babelfish Text Translation...twice.  First English to Spanish, then Spanish to English:

Not more than two stars. It ate the tacos of fish, #6. combined. The fish was exaggerated and oily and now I have a pain the belly. The rice was good, the beans was hardly acceptable. My daughter ate enchilada of the cheese. She was just very well also. My wife had kidney beans of the rice and the swindle of the flutes. Once again two to star worthy. Moreno' s does not come until now near my hole preferred in the Mexican restaurant of the wall, Mess orderly from in the boulevard of the chandler hardly to the east of the 10. Grieved, as soon as can' t recommends east place.

The original:

No more than two stars.  I had fish tacos, combo #6.  The fish was overdone and oily and now I have a tummy ache.  The rice was good, the beans were just ok.
My daughter had a cheese enchilada.  It was just ok as well.  My wife had flautas con arroz y frijoles.  Again, two star worthy.  
Moreno's does not come close to my favorite hole in the wall Mexican restaurant so far, El Ranchero on Chandler Boulevard just east of the 10.
Sorry, just can't recommend this placeCheck it...

I generally loathe restaurants attached to a hotel. 

With the exception of Cleo (one of my favorite spots in LA) inside The Redbury (my favorite hotel in LA). 

I don't know what the deal is, but they always look like overstock dot com took a dump in the middle of the room (metallic wall art, turquoise arm chairs, ultra modern textiles) and the food is about as exciting as watching paint dry. I guess because it's in a hotel it needs to be bland enough to please everyone? 

In any case, DSG follows in the footsteps of all the other places I've come across where you can slumber and snack... it's just not good. Not only were they out of 3 menu items (one of them being olives... how do you screw up that order?) but the things they did have weren't great. Cheese curds dripping with oil and flattened like little pancakes. Salumi that though I was told was prepared in house felt like chewing flavorless fat. The tuna wontons were fine. The parmesan fries also fine, but nothing about the experience blew any of us away. Service was awkward, less than informative and not very warm. 

I apologize to visitor's to Madison who may not make it out of the hotel to dine. This is not a good representation of what our city has to offer.If this were my first experience with a Moes, I'd have been pretty unimpressed. We actually went through security twice though because we don't have regular access to Moes, but thought we would get there since we could.
We stood there for at least 2-3 minutes before they acknowledged us, we were the only ones in line. The guy that took our order had no idea what a Billy Barou was... odd, since its been on their menu forever as far as we know, including the menu right there in front of him. While he was making my homewrecker, I guess he hadn't quite mastered the moes technique for getting guacamole and sour cream into a burrito and I ended up with one huge glob of sour cream and one glob of guacamole and hte rest of the burrito had none. He didn't really seem to know what he was doing and none of the other employees seemed like they were trying to help.

The ingrediants were definitely not up to what I think Moes standards would be. The rice was dry, the steak seemed like it had been under a heat lamp, and the chips were not that good. In addition, the the lack of the salsa bar that I'm used to at Moes was a bit of a bummer.Our  breakfast this past weekend, not so good. super crowded and order was not correct.I tagged along for breakfast this lovely Saturday morning to The Breakfast Joynt because my friend bought a Groupon.

The Joynt was a bit hard to find, as it is tucked into a shopping center, but my guess as to where it might be ended up being correct. (Maybe there was a sign near Northsight or Raintree, but I didn't see it.)

When my friend and I walked into the Joynt, no one greeted us. I didn't see a sign stating that guests should seat themselves, so we pretended to be cool and read the whiteboard of specials until a kid about the age of 14 picked up some menus and pointed to an empty table. Yay for nonverbal communication? I completely agree with Jay F.-- the Joynt needs a sign stating to seat yourself or a greeter.

When seated, a somewhat cheery waitress came and asked for our drinks. We both ordered the fresh squeezed OJ. (I read on Yelp that the OJ was great, so I decided to try it.) The OJ came in a small glass and had absolutely no pulp. It tasted like some Minute Maid product that rolled out of a vending machine. Definitely not worth the $2.99 price tag. The waitress (no clue what her name is because she didn't tell us) asked for our food orders, but I wasn't ready, so she left and didn't come back for a good 5-7 minutes. 

We ordered the waffle and two eggs (scrambled) and the California Benedict and sausage. I disliked my breakfast. The eggs tasted like military powdered eggs that you add water to while in a combat zone. (Those Ready to Eat Meals with the 25 year shelf life.) The waffle was tough and chewy, akin to eating rubber. I wish I could have said something to my waitress but she didn't come back until after the bus boy took away the plates-- not even a stop five minutes into the meal to see if we needed anything, thus no proof of the awful meal. 

However, my friend really liked his meal. He liked that the sausages weren't prepackaged rounds, but rather looked as if the cook formed the patties in the kitchen. His poached eggs were cooked perfectly and he really liked the avocado and tomato on his Benedict. 

The Groupon was the best part, but I agree with other two-star reviews like that of Tori B., Daniel E., Ron R., Jay F., and J. S.: "Meh. I've experienced better."

TL;DR Nothing special and not worth the hype or the price.The place is a bit unassuming in terms of the room, simple, light colors and large pics of Sinatra and his cohorts. Service is solid, portions are decent but up sells on small items, like a "side" of a 1/2 cup soggy spaghetti in meat sauce for $10 was silly, and mediocre at best. Like most places in Vegas these days they are not providing what you'd expect for the money. Passable, but not worth a special visit by any means. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the abundance of good, reasonably priced restaurants here in AZ. See my review of Aiellos in Phoenix - that was what I expected here - but did not get.went to this store b4 and wow... sorry to say but one employee messed it up for me... I was hunting down a dress i was inlove with and i called all the stores in Vegas... this girl told me "Oh, all the other stores send us all the clearance stuff.. so if it's not here u won't find it anywhere!!! .... omg I drove down there and the dress was there!!!!! freakin lazy a$$$... any ways.. I will never go there again... but I'm sure all the other girls there are nice but this giel was not the bizzznizzQuality shouldn't be sacrificed because this is an airport location.  CPK can generally be relied on for tasty food, but this location just sucks. What you'll find here is a limited menu and an unorganized waitstaff running around with its hair on fire for no real reason. You can find better food at the airport, don't let the reliability associated with the brand name fool you.Usual Quiznos.  They dont accept most Quiznos coupons.  They seem like they are a franchise that doesnt work with corporate sales etc.

I usually pick a differnet location if I have to have toasted bread.Good: The atmosphere is pretty cool. It's laid back and the music selection on rotation is pretty decent.

Bad: The music is way too loud, and you can't hold a conversation without shouting. The staff are kind of disinterested and borderline rude. Prices are a bit high for essentially getting a gourmet Hot Pocket; and wasn't worth coming back for in my opinion.

Other Thoughts: I can't help but hate hearing, "Cornish Pasty Co." or "Pasty" when my co-workers refer to this place. To me it comes off very "hipstery" and campy.Ever hear the saying, "You get what you pay for?"  Well, you'll be saying that when you visit or stay at the Tropicana.  Our room was decent...nothing special.  I did notice that there were a few holes in the walls.   The flushing knob on the toilet also looked as if it was going to fall off.  If you don't plan on staying in your room for very long, I'd recommend going here, otherwise, use those extra bucks and stay somewhere else.   The location is good though because it's about three miles from the airport so you won't spend too much for a cab ride over there.  The layout is OK (I never got lost which is a good thing for me) and the pool has a decent waterfall.The grilled chicken caesar is obviously prepared elsewhere and shipped in.  The dressing comes in packets and it's pretty much the most low rent $14 salad I've ever had.  The server was decent though. 

Don't eat here.  Maybe grab a beer though.Another in a line of chipotle style rip offs this place offers the usual cast of faux Mexican dining fare. White rice, black beans, corn, and a few meat options, check. Hipsters who act like they can not put down their phones yet are so concerned about saving the earth, check. While there is nothing wrong with the idea (imitation is the sincerest form of flattery) just how many of these places do we need?

In my opinion if you are going to copy something at least bring something new to the table when you do! This place does not meet that goal. In fact they manage to mess up some of the basic things that chipotle did right while charging you more at the same time. That is quite a feat to pull off lol. My order was for two burritos (one pork, green sauce, brown rice, cheese and the other shredded beef, cilantro lime rice, black beans and hot sauce). Both were a nice size (compared to chipotle) yet cost almost a full 2 dollars more! The pork had a nice spice but was to salty for me. The green verde sauce was ok but tasted of mostly tomatillos. It could have used something to balance it out like cumin, roasted poblanos, honey or even some more garlic. With drinks the total came out to something like 22.50 for two people! I can make this food at home for way less than that and still have money left for dessert. While it is nice to try eating somewhere new it is not worth almost $25 and 110 plus degree days just to eat here again. Good for some but for me No Bueno!I only have been here when others I am out with pick it.  If it was my choice,  I would steer clear.  The prices are higher for mediocre food.  The lighting is too dark for my preference.  The place has many Sun City residents visiting/long waits to get a table.  No point doing a call ahead,  you still wait (we called ahead but waited 45 minutes after our time slot). And the staff rush you through so that they can get the next group through.First of all, they offered me a beer as part of my complimentary beverage options.  Amazing.  Love it.

Now, to the terrible part.  I did not get the haircut I asked for, not even close.  I asked for face framing layers and I received a short layer that went around the crown of my head.  I have curly hair, so you can imagine what that looked like.  

I did not notice how bad the cut was, because it was straightened when I left.  As it curled up, I realized how bad it looked.  I asked for one, very important thing.  Please, make it a wash, blow dry and go look.  I am someone with a very fast paced life style.  I now have to take 30-45 minutes each day to actually style my hair.  

I have my portraits for law school coming up and my hair is terrible.  It has been nearly three months and waiting for this hair style to grow out has been excruciating.  There is NO saving the current hair style and its current lengths.  Yes, that is plural.  

I am a person who dresses very simple and sophisticated. I am not a hipster who wants her hair to be chopped and trendy.  It was awful.  $25 for a haircut.  I guess you get what you pay for.  

I emailed the person who cut my hair and all she did was recommend one of their overpriced products.  I am offended.  

I cried after this haircut.  Literally, sobbed.  Why can't I find any place that can cut curly hair?Called the rainbow store to check on stock for tulle.  After 20 minutes found they didn't have enough of the color I was looking for.  I was told it was 4 yards for $3.  Checked the Henderson store and they did. So as soon as I got off work I went down.  They cut the tulle and that is when I found out it was actually $1.99 a yard.  Come to find out the sale had gone off at close yesterday.  Spoke with the manager and he said they couldn't honor what the other store told me and there was nothing they could do.  Despite the fact that I was buying 36 yards plus multiple other items. He told me I could try driving to the Rainbow store (30 min.), return it and see if the would honor the quoted price, but no guarantee.  Not the service I have come to expect from Joanne Fabrics.  Very disappointed.Today, I finally saw CityCenter, and I was stunned by how lackluster it was.

The place in general was just lacking in character and charm. It was basically a high-tech Wynn or the Bellagio with less flowers, less art and no Italian motif. 

The Aria is borderline hidden, the easiest way to get into the place by pedestrian means is through Crystals, which is confusing enough in of itself. The waterfall and colorful fountain outside were nice enough, but the execution is a total fail. What use is stuff like that if it's hidden?

I walked in, started looking around when my subconscious pretension and snottiness block started going off. It was as if an alarm was going off in my head telling me "I REALLY SHOULDN'T BE HERE." Besides, the place looked immense and knowing me I would have easily gotten lost.  

I'm happy I saw it once, but it seems like it worked much better in theory than it does in execution.Atmosphere was ok.  Service all around was pretty sad.  Rooms were average.  Overall disappointed in the hotel.Casino review (not hotel/rooms) -- the dealers at this casino are some of the most uptight who won't indulge in conversation, won't even smile, in fact, we kept getting ID'ed even though we were much older which got really annoying..Rooms are big and views from the upper floors can be stunning. A few things need to be changed, though. Called for extra sheets and it took more than 30 minutes for housekeeping to come up. The water pressure in the shower was poor and for a place that wants to market itself as a high end hotel, this is not acceptable. There is a $22.40 resort fee every day, which includes WiFi so I guess I paid $22.40 for WiFi daily. The exterior already had broken glass/plastic on the floor above us that we could see from the window. The sofa bed is not comfortable.

Check-in was easy as was check-out. There is no casino, which can be either good or bad depending on your personal preferences. Also there isn't really a restaurant but the deli does sell bottled drinks and alcohol. If you want to walk to another casino, you can walk mostly indoors to the Bellagio, which is a plus, but if you want to go to the Cosmopolitan, you have to walk outside and down the stairs then across the driveway leading to the hotel. All in all it was fine but I don't think I would stay again.Oh Vdara, how I expected SO much more from you. You were so pretty from the outside. I am deeply saddened by how you turned out.

Being in City Center, I expected this hotel to be an excellent choice to stay in. From the photos and video tours on their website, I would be a fool to think otherwise. I was a fool. Vdara's standard check-in time is 3pm, but I had called (twice) earlier that week to confirm early check-in. The front desk staff confirmed it would be no problem. The day of, I called again on our drive there to confirm it was okay. When we arrived at 12pm, the room was not ready. Not only was it not ready, the front desk attendant claimed they have a strict, no early check in policy -- who were those people telling me otherwise ALL week then? A little annoyed, but decided to let it go.

At 3:15pm when I came back to the front desk to check in, the girl looked up our room (I saw on her screen that it was marked as uncleaned), but she gave me our keys anyway and (discreetly) radioed her colleague to check out the room ASAP because we were coming up. When we got in, the floor was wet, the garbage under the sink was not taken out, there were empty soda bottles in the fridge, and there was VOMIT (yes, VOMIT, PUKE, THROW UP, whatever you want to call it), on the bed. Disgusting and unacceptable? I think yes. I immediately called the floor manager and she was beyond rude. She said the room wasn't cleaned properly because I rushed her staff (isn't their policy ready by 3pm? I showed up at 3:15). She tried to have me not involve the hotel manager at the front desk, and she was very snarky and unapologetic, like I had done something wrong. I wish I had remembered her name (I would post it here), but all I remember is that she had a Russian accent & we were on the 10th floor. It took about an hour of going back and forth between her and the hotel manager at the front desk before our room was properly cleaned. They did offer us some hotel credit to use at the restaurant to compensate for our troubles which was nice. We didn't get moved into another room like we wanted though. 

This was probably an isolated tragedy, but even so I would probably never stay here again.

So what were the pros of this hotel? 
1) the view from the panoramic room were pretty spectacular 
2) the bellhops were SO nice -- extra star just for them
3) hotel manager did his job -- he apologized for the inconvenience and made it rightMy husband and I are retired professionals and long time mLife members who travel frequently to Las Vegas (10-12 times per year). We typically stay at the MGM but have recently begun to explore the other MGM properties. We have enjoyed Mandalay Bay, New York New York, Aria, and The Signature. This year, we booked a penthouse at the Vdara for a 4-day, New Year's Eve stay. While the staff was extremely gracious and helpful and the room was furnished stylishly, we were very disappointed with what we encountered once we settled in. We had to request the basic amenities - washcloths were not provided, the mini-bar was empty (although we never use it, we didn't want to be charged for the missing items), the bathrobes had no belts/ties, the kitchen had no cleaning supplies (dish towels, soap, dishwasher soap). We were provided with wine glasses upon request, but were told there would be a charge for providing champagne flutes. We asked three times for paper towels but could not get them so we had to use the bathroom towels to dry our dishes.  The 2-quart trashcan in the kitchen did not even hold a small take-out containers so trash had to be placed on the floor. Coffee was provided but no sugar/creamer packets were included. A washer and dryer came with the room, but no laundry soap. Although we requested the missing items, we only received the washcloths, dish soap and wine glasses.

The bathroom has almost no counter space for toiletries. Although we were encouraged to save energy and reuse our bathroom towels, there was only one small hook over the sink (no towel racks at all). The Internet, while "free" with the $25-per day resort free, took more than 20 minutes each day to establish he 1Mbs connection. We are not picky people, but were surprised that Vdara chose style without considering the essentials. We certainly would not classify this as a penthouse experience nor a Forbes 4-Star Hotel as the advertising indicated. Needless to say, we will not stay at Vdara again. For those looking for a condo-like experience, we highly recommend the Signature at MGM. All of the basic amenities are provided at check-in (washcloths, kitchen supplies, etc. coffee, creamer, sugar, salt, pepper), the bathroom, living room, kitchen and bedroom are far more spacious and less costly than Vdara.I was intrigued by the computer kisok ordering, however not getting the human interaction/acknowledgement that your order was received on was uncomfortable for me.  I ordered thier Butter Chicken and was given the choice of either rice or naan (why can't I have both for the $8, I can add to get both for at least $1 extra) and a mango lassi.  I selected my order To-Go and awkwardly waited, wondering if they got my order, if I was supposed to wait at the counter for my mango lassi or if it all came out at once.   It wasn't busy (like 3 customers waiting on To-Go orders) but the employees appeared just as awkward trying to put the food together.  The man before me had ordered one of their Specials that day the Butter Chicken Wrap.   The Butter Chicken was way to saucy for a wrap and the workers were clearly flustered by the fact that it was busting thru the naan.  The employees there wanted to make it over for him but he said he would take it as is.  They make their naan one at a time, which means you get it fresh but adds to the wait.

Like many of the other reviewers I waffled between 2 and 3 stars. While the food was good (not great), the awkwardness of the expereince has me dropping it to a 2.   Will I go back?  Yeah, until  I get a good Indian restaurant  downtown.We came here Easter Sunday. They had leg of lamb and a couple other additional items including lobster. The price was more than the normal $33.99, instead it was $49.99. Although the variety is better than must Vegas buffets, with the exceptional of Wynn, the price is certainly not worth it. The wait was long, although not longer than other buffets. The lobster was definitely frozen and the imitation crab stuffing was awful. The raw oysters didn't have any flavor and the leg of lamb was dry. I do have to admit the prime rib was good as was the lobster bisque. However it still wasn't worth the $49.99 price. I've had better, for instance, Wynn and Bellagio. Save the money and stick to those two, the drive from the strip, the wait and the price just isnt worth it.I would like to start  by saying the visit started with a two hour wait and the cattle fence was not even half full when we arrived! Without a doubt the worst line of any in Las Vegas. Now to the food, overpriced, cold, empty dishes in the food lines and once again customer service was terrible. This could be a nice place if the management cared about the customers paying the bills. The only plus to this mediocre eatery has alcohol that was added to give the illusion that customers were enjoying themselves. Being a non-drinker this buffet has nothing to offer out of the ordinary.The food was really good but the service was not.  And this was on a Wednesday at 11:30, I would hate to see the "busy" times.  They employees were unfriendly and looked like their jobs were miserable.  Very bad atmosphere.. we had to wait quite some time for our table.. quite some time for our orders to be taken.. and quite some time for our food.  Like I said.. food is great if you don't mind bad service!!If you didn't tell me this place was not RA sushi I probably wouldn't know the difference.  Moira Sushi is located in Central PHX and not a lot of my friends know about this place.  I thought I stop by to check it out.  The ambience is pretty hip and cool, but besides that the food is okay.  What I do appreciate is they have beer from different Asian countries which is a plus.  Service was good nothing to complain about but nothing to be amazed either.  If you feel thirsty and need to just chill - stop by  for a while.  Enjoy!Quick Summary: Savers sucks. 

I don't understand why people like this place. It's very overpriced. I've been in and out of this location several times and even with a family group who loves to go thrift store shopping we've maybe found $20 worth of stuff to buy in here. And 1/4 of that was two aluminum water bottles I found. 

Customer service? I'm laughing at myself for even mentioning it. Hey, at least they have plenty of parking! And you can always walk over to Colleen's consignment shop a couple of doors down to make the most of your trip here. 

Otherwise looking for another thrift store somewhere else might be a good idea.In one word:  HORRIBLE!!

My mother is a huge Elvis fan so I grew up with the music.  In fact, the first memory I have is finding out Elvis died when I was a little kid.

A friend of mine had comps so I went with her to check it out because I had been thinking of taking my mom for her 78th birthday.  I'm glad I saw it first, because she probably would've burnt down the Aria had I subjected her to it.

The dancing was amateurish and the plastic Elvis hair was weird.  I felt like I was watching a bad high school musical performance.  They had female leads singing the Elvis songs.  I'd rather have a GOOD Elvis impersonator or just a good male singer performing the songs.  The females had good voices but it seemed weird to have them perform the songs of such an iconic male singer.  

The only reason this is getting two stars is because I didn't have to pay for this train wreck.Overpriced mediocre food. $18 Spaghetti was GOD awful. $13 or $15 Sliders (4) sans fries had diameter of 1.5 inch. Frozen hot coco was underwhelming at best. Vegas has more to offer than Serendipity.The Ribs were fat and chewy, not real good.  Staff was friendly and the place was like a ghost town.  No one was in the place......  Second time in a row thae food was sub par!I've belonged to this gym since it opened.  I don't know if it's because of a recent change in management, but it appears they are not paying attention to maintanence of the cardio machines.  Many of the treadmills have a sqeaking noise to them like the belts need attention and the heart rate monitor does not work on most of them.   Also, they are a bit stingy with the air conditioner, in my opinion. 

Overall.. looking worn down.   Thinking of making a change.I had a deep tissue massage appointment at the Spa this past weekend with Meredith.  I have had several massages a year over my lifetime and was very surprised at the poor quality massage I received at the Westin Kierland.  I saw many patrons walking out of their service with that "ahhh" look on their faces.  I did not have that.  I specifically asked her during the massage if my muscles felt tight and she said actually no.  Which surprised me greatly as my neck and back are usually a ball of stress.  I did tell her as we walked in that I would prefer that she spend more time on my back and neck and not my arms and legs but this did not happen.  I was very surprised when she has me turn over onto my back so quickly especially after I asked for the concentration on my back.  She did lift up my arms a few times and do some digging into my shoulders, but it was no where near what I would consider a deep tissue by any means.  The time that was spent on my neck was minimal and felt more like a quick back run than anything.  My time spent in the sauna, steam room, and pool was actually more enjoyable and relaxing than my massage.  I actually asked my friend how she felt about her massage and she had very similar comments to mine, although my massage did seem to be more in depth then hers.  We questioned whether the reason of our sub-par massage was due to the fact that we used travelzoo vouchers - although we did tip on the full amount.  Also during the massage I was told there would be an add on foot session.  I'm not sure what it was supposed to include, but I received no more than a 2 min scrub and 30 seconds of rubbing in lotion.  Over all, this was not an experience that I would expect at a location such as at the Westin, but more of a lesser quality massage parlor.  

I left a voicemail and 2 emails for Carol Ford who is the spa manager and she has not returned the call or emails.  This just adds onto the poor customer service that I received while visiting the spa.  As a local patron, this is a place that I would have given a second chance - but now after horrible Manager customer service on top of it - I will not return.  And I will let all of my friends know as well.

FOLLOW UP:  I was contacted by someone they asked me to come back and try it again.  I will post another review following that serviceJust another greasy spoon.My wife and I like eating at eest asian bistro and have been going here for 2 years. It is slowly going down hill. Food is great but the service has been below par. It is in a horrible spot back in a corner of a strip mall that is half empty of stores. We always eat there around 7 at night and we have never been there with half of the restaurant full. Service is always slow that I am to the point of only doing carry out. It is a shame because we enjoy the food. Tonight was the last straw. We arrived at the restaurant at 745 PM and there were only 3 tables eating. We ordered and the food came out quickly. After we received the food we didn't see our waitress again. All the waitresses were preparing to close for the night. It was 830 and the sign reads closing time is 930. Another waitress  came over to fill up drinks when we were almost completed with dinner. We ordered a  to go soup with her. Our original waitress came over with the bill and to clean up plates. The bill did not include the to go soup. The waitresses were at the bar just chatting away and neglecting customers.  We waited patiently for over 15 minutes for a waitress to return to pick up my card. She came back and I explained that the soup is missing on the bill and that we never received the soup to go. She said that the soup would be out shortly. I asked her that I would like to talk to the manager about the service we received tonight. She said the manager wasn't there and no one with authority was present. I expressed that I was not happy with the service I received and I was disappointed that I received this service with an empty restaurant.  She was very polite about what I told her but this hasn't been the first time. The food is 3 and a half to 4 stars. Service is a 1 star.I'll just get to the point.
Staff, great.  Cleanliness, great.  Food, eh.

Calamari was actually the best part.  It appeared to be fresh because it was not over cooked and rubbery. However the bottom pieces were a little mushy from the grease. 

We had the porterhouse and filet.  They were cooked perfect (medium rare). However they had absolutely no flavor what so ever.  I tried adding salt and that just made it unflavored salty meat. It is hard to imagine and hard to describe that there was no flavor to the meat.

The house salad was nice but the Caesar had way too much dressing.

Needless to say we will not be going back.I've only been here once, but the wait in line didn't seem worth it, and there weren't many options on the menu.  I was expecting there to be slightly more on the menu than eggs + bacon and pancakes.  

Also, prepare yourself to reek like bacon grease when you walk out of Ironworks cafe.  I don't think they have a very good ventilation system or something because my clothes and hair absolutely stunk afterward.

I strongly disagree with other reviewers that say this is the beast breakfast in town.  They obviously haven't been to Sophia's or La Brioche. :DShould be renamed "Peep Show; feat; JOSH STRICTLAND"  He and the female lead singer totally keep the show going. The dancers are all really fit, athletic and convincing. Holly simply shuffled around the stage clutching her robe shut, and looking insecure. By all means, SHE IS NOT FAT. That being said, though, the rest of the cast made her look really... amature. She needs to step it up and rock it out like the others do, especially since its "her show". Nothing against her, but dancing is just not her thing for me... on a positive note- the comical relief of Timber is also a highlight, and holly was very cute there, because she looked a lot more comfortable. Long story-short: confusing story line (but whos going for the story, right?), great singing, and overall fun show. just go into it thinking its a peep show, and not the "Holly Madison" peep show...I've been here a few times as part of pub crawls or staff nights out. I always think it's a decent enough place, but actually it's quite over-priced and not good value for money! the drinks are quite expensive - I was £4 for a Gin and Tonic (single!) and the food wasn't anything special - my lasagne was cold and the 'salad' was a lettuce leaf.

It gets really busy at the weekends and during sport events, the bug screen outside is a nice touch. Not for me though!Being, that I go to Vegas 3-5 times a year, for the last 18 years, I think I've tried just about every Vegas buffet out there.  This being said, I had huge expectations from the Buffet at Aria.

As I walked in, the buffet area looked pretty nice, but what really impressed me was the presentation of all the food items.  I mean, beautiful.  Unfortunately, it didn't taste the way it looked.  The food just didn't taste great.  The shrimp on ice, tasted a little funky, not sure if it was off, or just ...I don't know, but not good.  Omelet, was just ok, but they didn't have a huge selection of fillings for the omelet like at the other higher end hotels.  

Very little fresh fruit.  Chinese food portion was totally lame, over cooked, soggy.

Wait staff, was slow as well.

Oh, one thing that was very good, was the dessert section.  It looked great, and tasted great as well.  Another thing that was amazing was their sugar free chocolate cookie, amazing.  

Overall, if I were to spend $24 on a breakfast buffet, I'd go over to Bellagio or Paris.Such a nice hotel with such sad food. I was overall disappointed, even though the venue was nice. Saw some people from the Glee TV show there, but nothing worth writing about.I was here in June, and 6 of us had a business dinner with fine service and tasty food all around.  On this last trip, though...

First we ordered drinks and an appetizer.  They arrived in this order: 1) My date's drink.  2)  The appetizer.  3) My drink, after our appetizer was complete.  At one point during the appetizer, my server stopped by the table to ask if I had received my drink (he should probably know that, right?); when he was informed that I hadn't, it didn't exactly put a spring into his step.  I still had half my cocktail in front of me when dinner arrived, and with it, the wine we had ordered to complement.

The chicken satay appetizer, phad see ew moo and yellow curry were all unremarkable, and a few dollars more than you'd pay for better quality elsewhere.  I wouldn't return.I was generally unimpressed. The drink prices were incredibly high.. I mean $8 for a Guinness, really?

The burgers were pretty tasty (maybe that was just considering this was my first one in 8 months), but the prices were rather inflated. Each burger topping cost $1.50 extra unless you got one of their pre-made burgers. All of our burgers came out more well done than we had requested.

Generally, you are much better going to Delux-better product, better price, better ambience. (so I hear!)I've been here before and had a somewhat better experience. This time not so much. As we watch everyone around us get there food, we waited for quite sometime before finally getting our food, only to find the chicken pieces are way to small. We repeatedly asked for drinks and the waiter only visited out table way too few times. I'm sorry I won't be coming back for a very long time.Dirty floors, dirty peanuts, and the worst customer service you are ever going to experience. That's "Teakwoods" in a nutshell.

Sometimes a good dive bar can be fun. That is, when the bar is clean. While Teakwoods likes to position themselves as something above a dive bar, the environment they foster isn't much better than that. There are peanuts everywhere. I love peanuts, but these things are dusty and dirty, and they sit around in huge containers on the tables. Instead of supplying fresh peanuts every day, these guys must buy them in bulk and store them in a shed somewhere, bringing them in by the shovel to put on tables once a week. A week's supply of dirty, filthy peanuts on your table to wash down with your beer. Just what I want to look at when I am eating a meal!

The food is absolutely nothing to rave about. The wings are just "so so" . . . the only thing I found I liked there was the supply of cheap beer. And when that's your high point, you can imagine the crowd you'll attract isn't exactly the norm for a "Grill." I'd say that they've misnamed this place -- Its really more like Teakwood's Bar. There's no tavern here, no grill. Just a dive bar full of dirty peanuts and people who couldn't give a hoot about you except to get you in and pour cheap beer down your gullet.Skip this place.

Unless you get one of the limited couches in the "stadium" area, you'll be stuck with a tiny tv monitor in your booth area.

Food is mediocre. Drinks are okay. Staff is friendly.

They had a $25 per person minimum, but that is not a big deal since its easy to hit that with a few drinks and some food.

Next time I'll just stay in the local sports book area of the hotel I'm staying at.Judging from the range of scores from other reviewers I think your liking of Namaste might be based on a particular preference toward Indian food done a specific way.

I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was, but I just didn't enjoy my meal here very much.

The Chicken Tikka Masala was filled with HUGE chunks of dark meat chicken. I'm not usually a fan of dark meat but Indian cuisine usually gets it to really blend with the sauces and spices. This wasn't the case here - it was like tasteless brown meat dipped on sauce.

Meat and veg dishes on the lunch buffet were OK, but a little odd - Paneer mixed in with a dry sort of Veg offering was a little unusual and out of place.

Overall OK, but not in my first few choices for Vegas Indian.It's a cool little unique place. My friends and I met there for a happy hour, but that's really all Sleepy Dog is good for. 

It's in a really bad spot for the type of bar it is. Sleepy Dog is a coffee shop version of a Microbrewery. It only deals in its beers. It has short hours, and it's only the type of place that you you'd stop in before you start your night, but it doesn't serve food (they do have complimentary popcorn and pretzel bowls, and people are welcomed to order food from other nearby businesses) and you have to drive on to get to another place (just what you need after drinking). The sign is also really small and hard to see from the street (a usually busy University Drive). 

My girlfriend and I decided to split a sampler. It had seven or eight of Sleepy Dog's beers. A few of them were alright, but the lighter beers were way too light, and most of the dark beers were low on flavor. There were a lot more options to choose from, but I would assume what's on the sampler should be the best stuff, which made us unenthused to try the rest. 

I would stop back at Sleepy Dog if someone wants to have a another happy hour there. But I would never go out of my way to head back there.Ok. After reading some good and some not so good reviews we decided to try Bambini's. As I mentioned in the quick tip, the garlic knots were amazing! We were there on a Friday night around 7:00pm and the place was fairly packed. We were seated quickly and the drink order was taken right away along with the appetizers. The drinks came, but the knots didn't... not for a while. We put in our pizza order, a large Margherita with fresh tomatoes. The knots were worth the wait, the pizza wasn't. The sauce was flavorless as was the basil. It tasted like pizza out of a box.

The service was lacking. There didn't seem to be a designated server. You ask for a refill over and over and it takes a while to get it. While we were there a large group came in and left saying they had called ahead for a reservation and there was no table available.

Worst of all is the music machine they have on the back wall. It's loud and the music is absolutely hideous!

We will probably not return. $30.00 would've bought better pizza at Sammy's.Ok, ok. So 2-stars doesn't look great. And the truth is, I suppose it isn't. However, I should clarify that this isn't a "bad" review.

First - if you are looking for The Griddle like the one in LA, this isn't it, so don't get your hopes up.

Now...  One of the easiest things to make tasty is probably a simple plate of bacon and eggs with toast.  The Griddle accomplished that.  I ordered two eggs over easy, a side of bacon, and wheat toast. I got everything I asked for, and it was all pretty good.  Coffee was fine and my cup stayed full during our visit.  The atmosphere was ok and the service was friendly.

Was there anything special about The Griddle? Well..... no. However, if you want something that is an alternative to IHOP or another sort of generic breakfast joint, this isn't a horrible option.Not Impressed. I was born and raised in Arizona, left about 10 years ago, and have recently returned. In the 10 years I have been gone, Scottsdale has gone through an explosion of commerce from big chain restaurants to little mom + pop shops and boutiques. I was eager to find some good coffee shops, so I hopped on Yelp and found this place ... boy was I disappointed. 

From the moment I walked into the shop and up to the counter I continually got the feeling that I wasn't welcome in the shop. I walked to the counter, and hung back a bet letting the customer behind me order, while I perused the chalk board menu (a nice touch). After deciding what I wanted to order, I stood in line and noticed the actual record player with a bunch of records representing the last few years indie/college hits (I also dug the record player putting out tunes). I stepped up to order and was not ever spoken too, I politely asked for my order, tipped a dollar, and was at least waiting for a smile or acknowledgement but received none. I then walked away from the counter assuming my order had been placed (I did receive change). 

I watched the female barista make my coffee, which she then simply placed on the service counter (again did not announce or gesture that it was my order). I had to assume it was mine because I was the only one waiting. I walked up the counter, asked if it was my order, to which the employee simply nodded her head. I had asked for my drink "to stay/for here" but I was given a coffee in a to-go cup, normally I wouldn't even notice this type of mistake however, as per above, I got the feeling I wasn't welcome. 

I then sat down to try and do some studying and the moment I sat down and opened a book, the barista began to give me icy glares. I put in some head-phones to listen to a few video lectures and about a minute after I put on the headphones, the barista walked from around the counter and turned up the volume of the speaker system to an abnormally loud level. I noticed that the other 2 customers in the shop were also taken aback by the absurdly loud level of music. At this point I got the hint that I wasn't welcome in the shop, packed up my stuff and left.

I should note I was the only non-white person in the shop, I don't know if it has anything to do with the attitude I was given, but considering the deference I was treated with it is either an unfortunate coincidence or this place really is intolerant of others.

2 stars because despite all the shenanigans my latte was actually pretty good and was 3 dollars, which I thought was acceptable for the quality. Will not return because for 3 dollars there are numerous other places to get an equivalently good drink without the attitude.The atmosphere is fine and the shop is clean, but the gel manicure is no good. The polish is sketchy in some places even after three coats. The technician drew blood on two of my fingers after cutting the cuticles too short. When I pointed it out and asked her to be more careful, she laughed, which may have just been a language barrier.

I would expect a nicer manicure for $25.The food is on par with any decent casino buffet, but having to pay full $19.99 price for a 5 year old is a bit ridiculous IMO, so definitely skip it if you have kids...So we arrived on Besos opening night with high expectations.  We were greeted warmly by a couple of waiters and quickly offered drinks.  We indicated we wanted "regular water" since anyone that goes to Vegas knows they will charge you for bottled water.  Wine list presented we ordered a bottle and later found out that they did not yet have many of the bottles and even some on the mix drinks on their drink menu.  No big deal, there was still lots to choose from.  We decided to order various different appetizers instead of entrees in order to try out a variety of foods.  So disappointing.  They make a big deal about Eva's special guacamole only to get a big glob of mediocre guacamole that costs $10.  I make it better for about $4.  Then their beef tar tare was a big glob of diced, unseasoned beef on a bed of mashed potatoes.  So unappealing!  The taco sampler was like ordering from a taco truck.  Lastly, our fourth appetizer never made it to our table.  Whether they forgot or not I am unsure, but when we decided to cancel it they took soo long to return to our table with the updated bill we almost got up to find the manager.  They apologized for the delay stating the first night is always a problem in the kitchen.  How sad considering all we ordered were appetizers.  I do admire the tranquil beauty of the place, however it does not ultimately make up for the less than spectacular food that doesn't really convey a latin theme.  It is a Hodge podge of different foods that are less than memorable.  I wish I could say something better but it all boils down to the food.  There is definately better places to eat.I would like to start with 'I LOVE the food here'.  It is one of my absolute favorite lunch spots.  

So why the two stars you ask??  Because 95% of the time our order is wrong.  When we are dining at the restaurant  it isn't that big of a deal, it is when we order to go that it is extra annoying.  The funny thing about it is that we always order a 'build your own sub'.  So it isn't like we are being super picky and changing orders around!!  It has gotten to the point where we won't order to go anymore and we are hesitant about going because it is pain to always send our orders back.  Such a shame too, because this place could be great!The only reason I came here was because I was staying at Aria and it was convenient. Sometimes you are surprised in a good way and this wasnt one of them. Mediocre bartenders who just had no concept of who was at their bar first. We were constantly ignored and told to wait.

This place is a circus full of clowns and it isnt a lounge. This is like a supermarket deli with loud music and a crappy bar.This was my third Vegas rock and roll -- last year I ran the full and had a terrific experience. The year prior I ran the half. I was so excited -- elated, actually -- about the opportunity to run a race on the Las Vegas Strip at night for the first time. A friend  ran with me - which was great because we were able to navigate and dodge some of the crowds (before/after/during) together.  I had a strong run, but found it to be really chaotic.  WIth the increased number of runners, plus volunteers, plus supporters, plus tourists and many events in town the same evening/weekend those running (and race organizers) faced some surprises. In all fairness, big crowds sometimes make me a bit crazy and running at night and running in the cold isn't really my "thing."   I feel strongly that the opportunity to run at night in Vegas is unmatched and also feel confident that based on feedback received, the city and the race organizers will do what it takes to make necessary improvements and this will be a much better experience for everyone running in 2012. Huge races like this are exciting and can be fun, but some runners are better suited to (and enjoy) smaller races.Sorry to say but I'm not a fan after my first visit. Maybe I just ate on an off day but I dint enjoy the flavors as much when compared to say Pita Jungle and though the meat and vegetables were over done service was very friendly though so it wasn't all badI had high hopes for this place...cute name and theme.  Plus, I looked at their menu online and was pretty excited.  

What's funny is that OTHER than the food (somewhat of a big deal when I go out to eat and I'm starving!) I had a great experience here.  Service was great (really great actually), we got right in and I had one of the best gin cocktails I've had in awhile.  Delish...if anything go for a few drinks and move on somewhere else for the food.

I had trout and it was worse than something I could make at home on a Tuesday night.  Which is saying a lot b/c I'm a terrible cook.  Sides were flat, small portion and just not very satisfying.

Conclusion  - great service, great drinks and fun atmosphere but terrible food.  Lots of other great places like that in Scottsdale, don't waste your time!For as much as this restaurant was hyped, and for as much thought as was put into the aesthetics, I expected much better food.

We visited CD on a Friday around noon, when I thought the place would be full.  Instead, we found it virtually empty, which is not usually a good sign, especially for a place so centrally located in Old Town Scottsdale.  I tried the cheeseburger, which the waiter described to me as the best burger he had ever had, hands down.  While there was nothing wrong with the burger, I would probably not order it again.

Sure, it's a cool looking place, and I'd go again if it were just for drinks, but I wouldn't recommend it as a restaurant...not when there are so many better restaurants so close by.It pains me to down grade them a few stars but this last experience was disappointing.

I do note we did stop in for happy hour this time and really enjoyed the $5.00 margaritas and $5.00 mini tacos but I don't judge places by their happy hours because Happy Hours are usually happy anyway.

We had a really great dinner here last year and thought we would again. It's a BEAUTIFUL ATMOSPHERE here and they have beautiful Christmas Tree and Ice skating at the Princess.

 For Dinner I was going to try the Grouper or the Pistachio Crusted Tuna this time but to my surprise they took them off the menu and replaced them with a Tempura Battered Fish. (website needs an update)  Why would I order Tempura at a Mexican Place? So I went with the Skirt Steak. 

OK I didn't like anything on my plate. The steak wasn't tasty. It looked OK but just didn't taste good. I guess it needed some salt and pepper. I should have asked for salt and pepper. It was just soggy beef and also was like chewing just cow and not a tasty steak. I didn't like the potato gratin because it also needed salt and potatoes don't taste good unless they are salted. I didn't like the enchilada because of the horrible thick mole sauce. This was the worst mole sauce I've ever tasted in my life and if it was my first time with mole sauce I'd never touch it again. The sauce wasn't balanced and was thick and too much chocolate and it turned my stomach. I do note the table salsa was seasoned nice and the bar foods we tried were made nice so I know you can get good food here.

My husband ordered the short rib that I had last time. The rib this time was OK but not great like the one I had last time. This time it didn't have the really tasty crust on it and the portion size was much smaller. The rib was just passable and not made with the really great care like last time. But my husband felt really bad when he tasted my plate and told me I could have his instead since it was better.

A very nice manager did check on us and offered to get me something to fix my meal and it was before I knew what was wrong with what I was tasting. I told her it was just OK.

Last time they weren't busy and the food was very good. This time they were very busy and that might or might not be  factor in this last experience. I received my meal for free since I have a preferred diners card.Just went here 2 weeks ago and it was awesome taco Tuesdays.  However sometime in the last 2 weeks they've changed their taco shells.  Seriously the Taco's shrunk by about 1/4th.... Sad..Guess I'll have to start enjoying Taco Tuesday somewhere else...I just gave this place a second chance, I got sick the last time I ate here.

I'm very disappointed with how they handle errors.

I ordered to go and felt rushed while I was checking that there were no fish eggs. When I got home it was the wrong roll.

When I called the store the owner refused to make me the right thing or refund me. This is the first time I have had a problem here, but I won't be returning due to the very negative experience. I paid $14 for vegetables in a roll.

Edit: I was thinking about the time I got sick and found thishttp://checkit.regionofwaterloo.ca/portal/Inspection/Details/9fc23a9e-c4ae-4cef-a2d3-a157cd9d660aI was very pleasantly surprised as I walked in.  It was a hot, bright sunny summer afternoon and what a nice contrast was provided.

This place was dark and cool (my wife said she was freezing, but she always is) and it reminded me of a 100 year old bar in San Francisco.  Think dark wood, red velvet drapes, chandeliers and upholstered furniture.

The menu is small but inspired.  The portions are small but the prices very reasonable.  

The drinks were quite creative with exotic ingredients, but at about $12 each, they should be something special.



Why just 2 stars??



The service was just insanely slow.  

EVERYTHING took FOR-EV-ER.


When we were seated, another couple was nearby.  They said, "get comfortable, you will be here for a really long time"   

We ordered 2 drinks and 2 simple appetizers.

My drink took about 15 minutes.  My wife's drink followed about 10 minutes later.

The 2 sliders and a tiny flatbread took close to an hour from when we ordered.  We ordered another round of drinks about one hour into our stay.  

Meanwhile, the other couple was waiting and waiting and waiting to pay.  They had been there over 2 hours but did not want to be, that's just how long it took. 

Finally, they went and got a menu,  calculated their own bill, added the estimated tax and just left a pile of cash asking us to explain it in the unlikely event the server ever returned.

She came around and after waiting 45 minutes for the second drinks that never came, I just handed her my cash and said  "I'm leaving".  

We were there over 2 hours and half of our stuff never even arrived.


That is the thing I can stand the least: leaving a restaurant feeling angry at the waste of your time, the contempt shown for your enjoyment and wondering why a night of your life was wasted hoping for some server to grace you with their glance.  


We went home, warmed up some leftovers and made our own drinks.We were disappointed overall. The salads were good however the hash was not at all. Sad since this is their namesake we expected it would at least be good but that wasn't the case. Would not recommend & prices are inflated for what you get.2.5 stars. Homemade Pita bread is delicious and left me with high expectations for the rest of the food which left something to be desired. I have been twice, once with a large group and once it was just me and my woman. 

The service: When I came with the large group the food service was poor as plates came out at various times with about an hour gap amongst people who ordered at the same time. When it was just two of us, everything as ok.

The food:  Have had two vegetarian plates the moussaka and the couscous and both were overpriced for the quality of the food. Vegetables were definitely out of a can and was something I could have made at home for about $1.50, which is unacceptable for a 12 dollar veggie meal. It is not that expensive to grill up some fresh vegetables and increases the quality of the meal substantially. Also had the lentil soup, which was tasty and not bad for $5, but it might have been from a can as well, just harder to tell with a soup.. You are likely not going to get what you pay for in food quality but the atmosphere is nice. If you are looking for some good flavorful ethnic food try GOJO Ethiopian on Thomas, you will not be disappointed.I wish they use fresh mushroom instead of can. We ordered half cheese and half monster but  the monster was loaded up and it made the bottom of the pizza soggy. Then the other pizza was sausage and mushroom (can) and pepperoni. That pizza was good but would have have be awesome with fresh mushrooms. I like the crust on the pizza it was crispy.  The guys at counter was nice and we didn't have any problems  like other yelpers.I am giving this place two stars and they all go to Frank. More on that later.

So I walk into this AT&T store to see the newest phones they have as I am in need of upgrading my phone. It is not overly busy but you would expect some to at least greet you within about two minutes of being in the store. I mean I have walked into many AT&T stores in my years and usually within a minute, someone comes to ask if you need assistance. This store, NADA. I walk around the store and while checking out phones, I notice that other customers that have come in after me have been greeted and are being helped. Me, still nothing. 15 mins later, one of  my friends comes into the store to find me and I mention to her that I have yet to have anyone acknowledge me in this store but whatever. I was looking for a specific phone so she goes up to one the sales men and ask where this brand of phones are located, he shows us and proceeds to walk away before I could ask questions. I am like really? Man, if I was a secret shopper this store would FAIL!  So we left.

Fast forward to about an hour later, and I go back to this store seeing as I was still in the mall and my phone was acting up. Again I walk in, it is not busy at all, and again no hello, no nothing. However I proceed to walk to the back and get a huge smile and hello from Frank, who is one of the service techs. (Hence the two stars) I am like wow, thank you for that warm greeting. It is a shame that I had to come all the way to the back of the freaking store to get a hello. They then proceed to call the manager Mario (as I had told them what had  happened when I came into the store an hour earlier). He apologized profusely for what had happened and assured me that it would not happen again. (hmm right) I will give Mario credit as after all this, he did take the time to answer all the questions I had regarding a few phones that I was interested in including the new IPhone, but both stars still go to Frank for that wonderful smile, greeting and help I received, even though I had to go to the back of the store to get it.MAC cosmetics department:  Not impressed.  I was making a large purchase and I was completely rushed by the associate "helping me".  It was not busy at all, so I don't see why I was rushed.  Unfortunately, this is the closest MAC to me.  Bummer.Ok...  The name contains "Urgent Care" which leads you to believe two things.

1. Your care will be "urgent"

2. This is a medical facility that treats minor emergencies and advanced illness.  I would expect them to bridge the gap between your regular doc and the ER.

Neither 1 nor 2 are correct.  Even with the call ahead WAHOO service you still have to wait.  Even when the place is empty.

And...  They only have Nurse Practitioners.  That's fine because they are in many cases better than doctors, but they are limited on what they can prescribe.  If you need something stronger (antibiotics in our case) rather than tell you that you need something they can't give you, they still give you a prescription for a weaker antibiotic and send you packing.

So I get less treatment than I get from my doc and I have to wait an eternity to get it.  Now remind me again why this is a good thing?Overpriced, average Italian in a hyped-up wise guy environment supposedly reminiscing of the old days of Phili lore.  Italian food should never cost this much.  I tried it twice, twice too many.Beautiful Hotel, but bad service.  

Seems like they are still working out the kinks here.  

The rooms are amazing!  Balcony terrace which I've never seen in Vegas and a beautiful view overlooking the bellagio fountain was great!   

Sub zero refrigerator dishawasher stove and washer dryer (just no utensils, cookware, or a coffee maker) - so if you want the room to cook in just be prepared to bring your own.  

Where things went downhill for us was that my brother was with me along with his wife.  Unfortunately they were on the east tower.  They were here from Florida.  DO NOT STAY IN THE EAST TOWER!  Unless you don't mind loud music until 2:00 in the morning.   

After enough complaining the hotel told my brother that they would move him to the west tower while we were out during the day.  By the time we returned at 5:00, not only did they not move him, but when we went to the front desk he was told there was no room available despite being told he would have one.  Exhausted, and lacking sleep they finally got himin a room but made him wait two hours for his bags keeping him from getting in a nap. 

In addition when we arrived on friday July 15th my brother had arranged for a welcome basket for us.  Unfortunately it was delivered to the wrong room.  I think around 8:00 or so that evening it finally showed up.  Oh well. 

My other gripe is that we wanted to go to peepshow.  Should have just gone to planet Hollywood to buy them.  We were told VIP was sold out but we would be right behind the VIP section.  If you call the back of the theater behind VIP then technically we were behind it.  

When we contacted the concierge they wouldn't do anything.  I've never experienced a hotel so disinterested in customer service.  

Today we ordered a large pot of coffee with extra cream.  $20.00 later including a $5.00 delivery charge  (no problem with that along with the included tip) we have coffee with milk.  How hard is it to get coffee right.  

My take on this place as a late 40's male with my late 30's wife is that this hotel is catering to the 20-30 crowd that doesn't mind $20+ cover charges $20 drinks and blaring techno.  I'm now too old for that so clearly I'm not that demo.  I want luxury. I don't mind paying for it.  

Maybe in a year or so this place will be great!  The property is run by deutche bank not MGM or ceasars or a regular casino operator so maybe over time it will be better.  I've stayed at dozens of Vegas hotels, and this place really is a nice property - great fit & finish with the rooms    I possibly had the random bad experience.  It happens but the way they treated my brother who unfortunately was stuck on the east tower makes me leery to stay here again out of fear that I might get a room on that side and never get sleep. 

So to sum it up.  

Great looking hotel
Poor customer service 
Geared towards a younger crowd 

If you can tolerate that you'll have a great time.The saving grace of Fox is that they have lower rates than anyone else.  That's what got me here.

Everything else is weak.  As other reviews mention, you have to take a shuttle to a shuttle, which sucks.  The line doesn't move quickly, the business looks trashy (come on, it's in a series of trailers) and it's not worth it.

I "upgraded" to a Chrysler 300, which performs like shit.  It was reasonably comfortable, which I liked, but acceleration was awful and the tires squealed at every turn regardless of speed.

For the standard car I reserved, Budget was only a few dollars more and is in the main rental car center.  Save some time, it's worth the little bit of extra money.I was not impressed. I got the most rushed, least detail oriented pedicure I've ever had. It wasn't very crowded, no one was waiting for my chair, so there was no reason for them to put so little effort into my nails.I went here one morning to get my eyebrows done, and the lady did a terrific job! I was so pleased with them and I WAS going to make this my new permanant go-to spot.

Here is why I changed my mind and why I gave 2 stars. Later on that afternoon, two of my friends visiting from out of town wanted to get their nails done. Of course I recommended we go to this place, seeing as the good service I got with the waxing would co-enside with nail service too right?
Nope nope nope nope.

We got there an hour before closing time, we all wanted a full set and they had enough people to so us all at once. So far so good. Then the actual manicure comes. The guy that did my nails did a TERRIBLE job. Horrific is actually a better word. I've never had so many hangnails in my life. He was rough and was rushing, even though there was no need to. He didn't properly attend to my cuticles so lo-and-behold 5 days later I already needed a fill. Not only that, but three of the nails he glued on crooked. CROOKED. Like my nails are hurting as they're trying to grow in. I went today to a DIFFERENT salon to get them fixed cause I was infuriated at the job he did. 

As for my two friends, one of them got lucky and got a good lady, cause her's turned out fine, the other friend had a worse experience then i did, her nails weren't smooth but grainy, and she asked for the half moon cut (THAT SHE PAID FOR) and they didn't do it, but instead rushed us out of their salon 15 minutes before closing time.

This place may be in a convienent location for me, but never going here again. EVER. (though the fruit with the water was the only plus, they should of put vodka in it to numb the pain my fingers were in)Came here for lunch the other day, the waitress/bartender was nice. Didnt sit at the bar, althought i guess we should have. We were told that since she was the only ine there, just yell her name and she'll coming running. 

We ordered our food, it was okay. I got the steak sandwich, which was dry and pretty much tasted like a slab of meat without and seasonings whatsoever. The fries that came with were awesome though. 

Service was slow with getting any refills. I'm sorry but I don't like to yell across a restaurant jus to get a refill on a soda. 

Could have been better if the bartender/waitress was a little more attentive.Hate is a strong word.......
but that's really how I am feeling about the front office staff.
I had to knock off another star.

So, like I stated in my previous review, I was charged $35 for a no show fee.....for an appointment that I could have sworn I cancelled.

Now, I KNOW that their scheduling department is messsseeeedddd up!

I will be posting a picture, showing my appointment card.

When I was last there in April, I scheduled an appointment for my daughter two months out. So, June 30th it is.

Looking at my card this morning, I keep asking my friends and family that it's the 30th....and that it's Monday. Because my card says Wednesday, June 30th. Slightly freaking out, I make the drive. When I arrive, they tell me that my appointment isn't today, that it's JULY 30. Not possible, I show them the card, and they instantly call out the staff member who's hand writing it is. They apologize, and ask if I still want to be seen today....UH YEAH.

I am asked if I have a copay.
....Shouldn't YOU all know if I have a co pay? Seeing as how you ask and make copies of my ID and insurance card EVERY SINGLE TIME I come. I told her that I didn't have a co pay, but that I did owe $25 for a previous billing that my insurance didn't cover. 

Of course, my daughter's pediatrician isn't there. So, of course, my daughter isn't used to dealing with a new nurse, and a new doctor. The doctor kind of got aggressive with my daughter's autism "scan" ... I guess because my 18 month old can't moo like a cow, she's at risk. 

Gotcha.

Anyways, we need to be seen again in six months.

I go to schedule an appointment for six months out, and they tell me that they can only schedule up to two **2** months out.

UUUHHH.
So, when I was here in APRIL,  how in the HELL was my appointment moved to the end of July?

I'm glad that my daughter was able to be seen today, but you know, what the eff? This front office staff is so terrible. I know that I'm going to have to call and make sure that I'm still not scheduled for July 30th, to avoid another $35 fee. 

TRIPLE CHECK that your appointment time in their system, and the appointment time on the card that they give you MATCH.

I love Dr. Lammotte. She was my pediatrician, as well as my brother's. She saw both of us up until the time we were 18. She is kind, down to Earth, but has a very straight forward "business" approach. She is no nonsense. I know a lot of people can find this "cold", but she has never brushed off any of my questions or concerns. 

I truly missed her today!!!!!The food is decent.  Not bad not great. The service is poor. The teenagers at the front were brats and rolled her eyes when i made a simple request. I ordered a chicken dish and substituted the meat for tofu and they charged me $2+ Really?! Tofu is cheaper! This place is only close to my house. That's why I ate here. I've given this place a few shots but It's not good.Horrible store! 

I don't understand why this store has such high reviews. 

The customer service (HAH) is one of the worst I've seen in a retail store. No one welcomes you as you walk in, no one offers to help you out no matter how lost you look, and when they do help you they don't even seem to be really paying attention to your needs. It literally took me half an hour to get a size on a pair of shoes that I was interested in buying. 

The clothes are cheaply made and wont last you in the long run but this is a "you get what you pay for" type of store. But I gave them two stars because the selection and layout of the store is nice. 

Jewelry is overpriced but the shoes are good.I wanted to love this place, I didn't.  Solo dinner, sat at the bar and that was my mistake.  Food was amazing; fillet Oscar, creamed spinach, brussel sprouts, bread pudding.   There were three bartenders behind the bar providing service for five of us.....   I felt completely ignored, to the point I spoke to management.   They don't know they have a problem if no one speaks up.  He knew it was bad.  He talked to me for at least ten minutes, the entire time both my coffee and water were empty and no one did anything!   He finally said something to the bartender, and admitted he was embarrassed and sorry.  I am guessing the dining room is different.  I say again, food was amazing,I will be craving that creamed spinach!I've eaten at Vino's inside the Cannery Casino several times, and the food has always been very good, as it was on our last outing three days ago. But this time there was a noticeable failure in service, to the point that after I ordered Calamari Fritti with both marinara sauce and lemon aioli to serve as an appetizer, not only did neither sauce arrive. Neither did the Calamari! First came a tasty cup of Minestrone Soup chock-full of vegetables, and a fine Caesar Salad of fresh romaine lettuce big enough to serve two, accompanied by addictive soft Italian rolls topped by garlic, over which I generously applied butter. In fact I downed four of them as we waited for the Calamari that never arrived. When our ordered entrees were at last delivered to the table about 30 minutes later, I mentioned to the server to take off the order of Calamari since it never came, and he just smiled and said, "Sure!" as if nothing was amiss. 

My Linguine and Clams in white wine sauce was all I hoped it would be. The sauce was billed as "buttery," and that it was. But, although my wife's shrimp in Alfredo Sauce had been specially requested by her to have no vegetables in it and be served with fettuccine rather than angel hair pasta, it came instead with bits of spinach (which she manually pulled out) and angel hair pasta. It is aggravating when a good meal is spoiled by lack of attention to orders--either by the server or in the kitchen! 

We will try Vino's again, because the food is really worth the visit when it is prepared as ordered, and we live nearby. But I am dismayed by the multiple errors in order taking, food preparation, and delivery that just turned what could have been a four-star experience into an aggravating two-star visit.Yelp, u embarrassed me. from all the spectacular reviews, I thought this place would be a great place to bring my wife for a treat. We were put into a room and the only thing a lady asked us was how long of a massage we wanted. My wife was never given an option for a female masseuse. Another thing, we were never asked if we had any problem areas or areas to focus on. The communication barrier at the place was terrible. That should have been a sign for us to leave, but we stuck through it since Yelp said this place was so awesome. 

I had a fantastic lady with halitosis although she attempted to mask it with mint gum. I got super relaxed at one point but her phone went off; all downhill from that point on. She took some more calls through the whole session. Annoying! Another problem were the coworkers talking to each other in Mandarin. They said some words that were insulting to my wife and I. My wife bit her tongue and didn't say anything because she wanted to snap at them!

At the end, it was awkward paying the bill because our massage people hung around the front counter till they heard what they got for a tip. 

one generous star for the value 
one generous star for the cashier - the only person we understood at the place

what about the massage review? I'm fat and my masseuse crushed me like I was skin and bones. She had a strong, but not so soothing touch and the same goes for my wife's masseur.The food quality & customer service has been pretty poor at this location. I was surprised at how items such as a simple taco or a burrito missed the mark.

The staff at the North Las Vegas location tend to be a tad rude at times (Especially this 30 something mexican woman, whose attitude stinks!). She rolls her eyes when I order food & seems very disinterested in the job. One of the cooks also seems easily irritated when customers have simple requests (such as not adding guacamole to the tacos, etc). 

I visited this place with my friend after a night out in Vegas, and altho the food hit the spot...the customer service left much to be desired. 

Would I recommend this place? Not really...I'd head to "Don Tortaco" off Craig & Camino Al Norte if I wanted a friendlier place with consistently better food quality. The staff there are nicer and greet you in a very natural way...especially if you are a familiar face :)

2 out of 5 stars for Roberto's Taco Shop. I docked 3 stars for the poor customer service, attitude and inconsistant food quality....things that easily take away from a pleasant dining experience.I was dissapointed in my experience at this eatery. I went in ordered my pasta with a friend and sat down. A couple minutes had gone by and my friend got her meal.. it wasnt until i had complained twice and my friend was almost half done that i recieved mine. When i got it the sauce was starting to harden and it was a bit cold.When I complained the staff was rude in explaining it got to me as fast as it could.  I didnt end up eating it but my friend claimed her pasta was amazing... she can go back there alone for more! haBuffy- the- thyroid freakin -slayer -Daney: A Tale of Needle Therapy Foiled
I had a less than titillating experience this week as I explored the Eastern side of Medical cures to ease my ailing thyroid. Dr. Buffy Daney, was one of the doctors who covers acupuncture on our insurance plan. I gave her office a call last week and I was scheduled to see her right away. 
A very pregnant woman called my name. "Hi, I'm Dr. Daney."  Well, sh*t on a stick!! I have nothing against pregnant women, after all, I was pregnant twice... but my mind began to race. Surely she was not due to have a baby for another 3 or 4 months. I mean, the office wouldn't have scheduled my appointment had she not been able to provide something called CONTINUITY of care, right? 
We proceeded to a very hurried and less than comprehensive intake of my symptoms and health history. I asked her if she had patients like me before. "Yeah" was her answer. "Have you had positive results?" I asked. "Um, well, the results have varied," she replied. And that was that.
She took me to the room. Placed some needles on my hands, feet, and one in my neck. She turned out the lights to complete blackness and overhead there was a flicker flicker of some fluorescent lights. We didn't go through the game plan, she just poked, then left. When she came back, I told her I needed to pick up my little one from school. Unaware of how much time I needed for travel, she told me I had 10 more minutes and had plenty time . 
She returned to remove my needles. "I'm 39 weeks pregnant and I'm taking maternity leave next week. You'll need more treatments. You can schedule another appointment with me this week and perhaps you can see my partner for Biofeedback therapy while I'm gone for the next 4 weeks. You can google Biofeedback if you like." 39 weeks pregnant, ready to have her baby any minute and her office told me as clear as day she was accepting new patients? Accepting new patients that she won't be following up on? Accepting new patients that may need more than one treatment? In fact, more than one treatment and several over the next few months. Really?! The plan was to dump me off on her partner and I can Google the information on what her partner does. "Why don't you take this Thyroid supplement? It has has thyroid stuff in it." I had follow up questions on the supplement and she had very little information on it. Holy crap! As a registered nurse I would have never told my patients to research the solutions I was giving them. Whether it was a pill to take, a procedure or treatment, I would have never expected them to find the information on their own. 
As I got up to leave, per her instruction, I told her I felt like a needle was still in. Oopsie, she forgot a needle! Man, I think she forgot that she had a patient and forgot her professionalism, too! Won't be back.Breakfast Review Only:

Pretty easy to find location directly on Cottage Grove Rd (coming from Madison it will be located on your left in a strip mall 1/4 mile after the Piggly Wiggly).

The Good- 
My coffee tasted good (I drink it black ~ exactly how coffee should be!). Not a single time did I look down on an empty cup. The 3 servers they had working walked around consistently with coffee pots. 

Service overall was alright. Our food was ordered and delivered to the table with in about 10 mins. for 4 people. 

They had an excellent selection of bread (including rye and sour dough!!!!) for choices as an accompaniment with your breakfast choice. 

Everything looked very clean and organized! 
Plenty of parking! 

I would say a solid 3.5/4 stars for the good. But, I went for food....so here comes the Bad...


The Bad:
I ordered the Greek Gyro Skillet. 
It was simple hash browns in a bowl layered with very, very small sliced gyro meet (I had a hard time finding any to tell the truth). A few sprinkles of feta cheese, like 3 small chopped tomatoes (like they ran out or something) and supposedly some onions? 2 eggs scrambled on the very top. 
Everything unseasoned and plain. 
They threw in a very small plastic container of yogurt sauce....but I'm not sure what for since I didn't have anything resembling a gyro in this. 
I got the sour dough bread as my side choice. 2 slices that came with a small amount of butter tossed on. Blah.

Unfortunately, the other 3 people I was with said about the same thing for there ordered food as well....

Maybe we came on a bad morning. Maybe the cook had a rough Saturday night? I don't know. Based off the other reviews my expectations were too high. 

It is very quiet in here. Please turn up some music or something to fill the dark noise. 

Kind of a major let down.
Will I try it again: Yes.....Gyro's were $5.75, and I'm game to try one eventually down the road when I'm craving a close Gyro to my home proximity. I'm such a sucker for a Gyro.This is a review of the giant cookie. I ordered one recently (snickerdoodle), and it wasn't very good. The cookie seemed like it had too much flour in it. Very doughy (not raw-doughy, too much flour doughy). As a result it was also pretty dry.

And they never asked about color for the icing design. I should have thought of it myself, so I have to take some of the blame. They picked a ridiculous color combination (red and zinc chromatic green) for me.  For an order like this they take your phone number, but they never called me to say "hey, you didn't specify a color".

I don't think I'll be ordering one from here again.  I had better luck last time at the Paradise at San Tan Village.Got a chance to check out RnR last night with a few friends. I loved the building and atmosphere. 

Called ahead and was told they do not take any reservations (think restaurants with that policy are so annoying) but was told the wait should not be longer than 15. 

We got there perfect timing and only waited about five. Nice patio and perfect night for dining outside!  

Was not too impressed with the menu. Very limited on choices, no vegetarian options. But if going with a small menu the items you do offer have no excuse but to be over the top amazing. Not the case. I ordered the Ahi Tacos off the "small plates" menu. Small was an understatement. Luckily wasnt starving or would have left very very hungry. I did love the spinach artichoke dip the group shared for an app. Perhaps still figuring out what menu will work best for them. 

Server was friendly. Will probably give this place another shot as I imagine they will continue to work out the kinks!I had lunch here one afternoon when it was surprisingly not crowded. I am giving four stars for an always cozy atmosphere and a nice patio.

I had the enchiladas which had a nice kick, especially the pork. But the quality if the food in relation to the price is what gets me. Everything is good but not great enough to warrant the prices. And the service is almost always lacking.

This particular time, we seemed to be the victim of our server going on break and their being a breakdown in communication or coordination. In any case, we had to  wait a while before our drinks were refilled and my salad was forgotten. Our server was nice and apologetic so no worries. Not always the case as some servers make it clear that they are way above looking after the likes of us.

So overall, not a bad place, the prices, quality and atttiude serve as enough of a deterrent to patronize again in the future.Great Margaritas.

But it's hard to review a mexican restaurant that's as good as the next.

I still wish there was a TRULY good mexican restaurant in Madison...

Still waiting.

And don't come tell me ... um... the one on Park.. what's that name???

....

La Hacienda.

I'd rather poke my eye out or eat at La Bambas....Great location, nice atmosphere, good food. But very slow service, and overpriced. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with no meat --  it took 20 minutes and cost $6.75.I want to like this place - I really, really do.  But it's fairly rundown, the bar staff makes you feel as if you're ruining their day by asking for a drink, the food is average, and the bathroom conjures memories of b-list horror movie finales.  

I've spent a few afternoons here watching the game, and even while sitting at the bar and tipping well with every drink, service is lackluster at best.  I've had their breakfast and some of the lunch fare - meh, nothing spectacular by any means.

Very much "the working man's bar," and I appreciate that aspect, but I can't help but feel like I'm just a step away from getting jabbed with a broken bottle or otherwise needing a tetanus shot whenever I stop by The Club Tavern.  

Middleton has better bars - try The Midtown Pub or Paul's Neighborhood Bar for a more personable and less sketchy experience.The restaurants that Food Fight offers are all subpar, with one exception of Johnny Delmonicos. Aside from the Johnny D's the others all serve incredibly bad food. I tried El Dorado's once and it was terrible, on top of things they charge so much for a margerita served in a tiny glass its ridiculous.Needed a quick bite across the street after I landed at the Sheraton. In short, some interesting stores and restaurants all just thrown together. I think it could be so much more. A Subway, Pizzeria Uno, Hooters, and AMC then a NY & Co. My fiancee would like the latter, but I'm thinking "well what the..."

For quick food come here; and don't get me wrong, next time I might try the Uno, as I love the one in Chi-town. But I get this feeling it's not really a mall or a center and just a few places crammed together to make the tourists feel at home, but I didn't feel at home. This place was sooo empty!!!My husband and I ate here after I purchased a Groupon. We both really enjoy Greek food, so we were excited to try this place out for lunch.  While the food was not bad, I definitely will not return.

I ordered the falafel pita.  I thought the falafel was very dry, and there really wasn't enough tahini to help out the situation.  The portions were huge, so if you like that sort of thing, then this place is for you.  However, I am not a big eater, and leftovers tend to go bad in my fridge, so I was not particularly impressed with the portions.  

My husband ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich.  Basically they took a chicken breast and threw marinara sauce and a little cheese on it and served it up.  The chicken did not have too much flavor, did not seem like it had been marinated or cooked in any interesting way.  Really, it was just a ton of mediocre food for not too much money.

This place wasn't bad, but it also wasn't good.  Come here if you like enormous portions of alright food for not too much money.I got hungry out on errands this morning & stopped in here for some breakfast.  The service was Poor with a capital "P" & the food was weak, too!

When I came in, the cashier pointed me to an ok booth, but it was a while before my loud waitress, who had brushed by my table several times, finally took my order.  After that, she disappeared.  (Did she quit?)  Anyhow, someone else eventually brought out my food.

I had a "Grand Slam" which used to be good, but 3 of the 4 items with this one were with this little tasteless hockey puck thing they called a "Chicken Sausage Patty", a little serving of hash browns the size I would give my cat, & two (small?) eggs.  The 2 pancakes were ok, but could have used more syrup.  A second napkin would have been nice too, but there was no one to ask for it.

Denny's (aka "Jenny's") here might be fun late at night, but it's a dud at 10 in the morning!     :-OUnfortunately the reason why this place  has gone down hill is because it's no longer what it used to be.I guess the recession hit this shopping center pretty hard, which is shocking since it's right across the street from the Biltmore. The shops and movie theater are kind of behind everything, so there's not a lot of exposure and whatnot. Plus, the parking structure is a pain in the ass. I personally wouldn't shop here because parking is such a pain. 

Anyway, I went to see a movie here at the AMC, which looked nice. In walking through the shops, I couldn't believe how many "For Lease" signs there were. Kind of sad to see. Anyway, I made my way to the movie theater, which is upstairs. There's a nice escalator to take you up, except it was broken. Ugh! I'm guessing either they shut it down at a certain time to save money or they don't have enough money to fix it. It wouldn't have been so bad except it just had rained and it was still 95º outside, so hiking up those metal stairs was not fun.Food is average at best.  But last two times the service was terrible.  They need to retrain their servers in customer service.  The only reason for the 2 stars is that there is no denying that their cheesecake is excellent.oh how i wished i check yelp before taking our concierge's advice about eating here.  the food was not good and was VERY pricey, i wish i went to the capital grille if i knew we were going to drop this much money, at least there i would have gotten a great steak and been satisfied.I am hesitant to write this review seeing all the glorious write ups before me. I came for lunch today and was very disappointed. I ordered the tapas trio and 30 minutes later the server came over to tell me they were out of the sauce for the meatballs and the chef did not want to make a substitution. Not a big deal, but 30 minutes was quite a while to wait to be told to order something else. 

On the servers suggestion I ordered the pollo cubano, it came out very, very dry. It was covered in a citrus sauce that was decent, but even with the sauce and marinated onions on top the chicken was barely edible. 
My friend ordered Arroz con Pollo and the chicken was just as dry, I didn't taste any chorizo and the asparagus was overcooked to a mush.
The sangria was pretty good and had a subtle rose taste.. I'd return just for it.

Like I said with so many good reviews perhaps this was just an off day. I'll certainly go back and give them another try, hopefully with an updated review to follow.much overdue review, but...

i guess it doesn't matter what was ordered here, because somebody has a heavy hand as far as salty condiments are concerned, so dishes are peculiarly salty, and it is possible that while en route to our table, someone surreptitiously powdered the food with yes, even more salt. flavor isn't necessarily bad, but if you didn't know, i prefer a blend of flavor(s), not just a flavor (salty). 

if you are luckily having salticious cravings, and would like to experience edema and other related salt and water retention, this is a great place.Not great but I ate it. I think everything just lacked flavor. Americanized Chinese food for sure, and I'm fine with that but everything needed salt or something, weak in flavor. I tried it but wont be back. I wanted to like  it cause I live close by.The store near Bell and 7th St. was filthy.
The employee making the pizza obviously had a cold or sniffles or something.  Repeatedly touched his face and handled the food.

My slice of pizza was very good.
But the utensils were all soiled, the tables were dirty, windows dirty, etc.

Been to this and other Ray's pizza locations many times.Just stopped for lunch before driving off. Food was below average. They had about 3 vegetable dishes and 3 chicken dishes. Nothing great .. Probably won't ever go back.This Taco Bell is located very close to Paradise Valley, which is evident because the Fry's supermarket that shares the same parking lot offers complimentary Valet Parking....LOL.

When I walked up to the counter, there was no cashier present.  I stood and waited for a few minutes...and waited....and waited.  I finally snapped this photo because I was bored.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taco-bell-phoenix-13?select=B_8TxcUXg61PmzTghnax5g#2hQRkmgKs5nxkjs9eXNnxg

When he finally showed up, I ordered my regular 7 Layer Burrito and 2 Bean Burritos.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taco-bell-phoenix-13?select=B_8TxcUXg61PmzTghnax5g#B_8TxcUXg61PmzTghnax5g

The food came out fast and accurate.  They were a little sloppy making the Bean Burritos as they had red sauce on the outside of the tortilla....which makes for a sloppy meal.  I would've expected better service from a restaurant so close to PV.

Overall, it wasn't too bad, but it was inconsistent.

Return Factor - 20%Yikes! Cold pizza when I called in the guy on the phone just acted totally confused & as if he was not responsible in the slightest. $50 of gross! Not ordering from this location ever again. Staff is clueless!FYI - if you plan to rent a car, allow extra time.  All of the car rental agencies are located in a separate terminal.  There's just one big bus to hop onto.  In light of the new TSA regs, they have little baggies for you to put your gels into [or lip glosses in my case].  Here's the interesting thing....At PHX they're drawstring... LAX has totally different bags....draw your own conclusions.....


ETA.  GGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH....I had to update this review.  The only reason it's not one star is because my bag showed up....EVENTUALLY.  I recently had to check a bag from Phoenix to Oakland, because it takes more than a quart size bag of liquids and gels to maintain the Rhubarb for a week.  Somehow, my bag and I did not end up on the same flight.  They found it within 24 hours of me getting home.  But it was a LONG 24 hours, and they just weren't very nice about the whole thing.  At one point this chick asked what was in my bag....um, I don't know.  I told her I did not make a list because I did  not anticipate the neanderthals at PHX would lose my beloved Samsonite wheeley.  When she asked me what type of bag it was, I said, do you want a serial number????  

OK, end rant.  let's hope they do better the next time.Not a horrible place, but certainly not good.

I landed in one concourse of the A terminal and flew out of another within the same terminal.  I walked through the first and saw several food options which gave me hope for my options near my departure gate.  Unfortunately after my long walk to the other concourse I found there to be very limited options.  This I cannot understand.  Both concourses had a similar number of gates, yet one was loaded with options and the other completely lacked them.  Of course by the time i walked to my departure gate I did not have time to wander back to the other concourse, so I settled for a lesser option near my gate.

Just hope you do not have to change terminals or rent a car.  Either requires a bus trip.  That is a big pet peeve of mine.  At least you do not have to take a train like in Atlanta or Denver.

The last issue I will cover in this review is the fact that Southwest and US Airways hold most of the spots at this airport.  That is enough reason not to fly here.One of my least favorite airports. The food options are quite limited (although slowly getting better) and the people are just not very friendly. (PDX has spoiled me.) It could just be my sensitive sniffer but there seems to be a faint stench in the air; probably from the old,worn carpet.Very few plugs to charge your devices in the gate areas. It is 2013, you can't spring for a few more outlets to accommodate the patrons? 

Also, the Wi-Fi took forever to connect. Why must I click on what seems like an insane amount of windows in order to get online?! I get you need advertising $ but c'mon!

The rental car building is a long bus ride away. I do like that all companies are innone place but you have to factor in an extra (at least) 30 min before you can get to your car. 

I'm pretty sure that you land in New Mexico and then taxi to Arizona. It seems like forever to get to the gate.Its just a jack in the box in the ghetto. I get the jumbo Jack with cheese and I like the egg rolls.  Last time through the drive thru I asked for ketchup.  I get back to work and their are three packets in the bag . WTF? I need way more than that.  Then they ruined the fries by adding way too much salt.She was about to give the next table to another guy,  when L stepped in and said something.  She had the nerve to tell that guy, oh sorry ihave to say summertime else first, I'll tell you why later.  Really? Are you twelve? And right in front of us? Really great customer service. She needs to go because she can't handle the pressure. Why they don't invest in those buzzers for these events.  Not very happy. .. we come here quite a bit and his family is here every Monday. I'll flag manager down, if I can. I had to downgrade my rating this time. Food rocks, but they need to reassess their Hostess.I'm not usually the biggest fan of Ra to begin with but we go there every now and then for Happy hour for sushi.  We decided to go to the Awhatukee location this time instead of Tempe.  Parking is usually crazy because they share it with a movie theater and other businesses. 

We were seated and ordered our drinks and all was well.  We ordered our food and we ordered 3 rolls.  It took them 45 minutes to bring out our rolls when we were starving.  They never take that long and it was just unacceptable.  Every time we asked our server to bring us something we knew it was going to take him 10 minutes to come back with it.  Our daughter was waiting for her cheater chopsticks so she could eat with us, and that took forever. Same with our bill etc. It was a pain in the ass.  Their rolls are pretty mediocre anyway.  They are never rolled tightly and they are tiny.  I don't think we will be visiting a chain like this in a while.  We will stick to a mom and pop sushi restaurant.A little surprised by all of the great reviews here, as I was very underwhelmed. Maybe I was in on a bad day? Came for lunch, and found the chinese food to be mediocre at best. The Orange chicken I had was really bad, so dry it kind of broke apart and separated when I would cut it. I also tried the sesame chicken, mongolian beef and sweet and sour pork. Some of the flavors were okay, but all of the meat felt like it was overcooked. Maybe that was just the constant reheating from a buffet style. I didn't get seconds of anything, and while I felt bad about it, I didn't completely finish anything that I took.

I don't like sushi, so I didn't try that station, and no one was working the mongolian grill style area, so that wasn't an option. For what I had, I found it disappointing, and at $11+ a drink, tax and tip, it's not cheap enough to be worth it. Service was fine, and the restaurant seemed clean, which is a plus.

It may well float other people's boats, but Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet is not for me.I have no Clue why people this this place was good. It was bearable at best.  The food was not awful, but not anything to jump up and brag about either.. The Store is interesting and I suggest you look through and browse.I always enjoy going to the JW Marriott Desert Ridge so we decided to stop by the hotel and have a drink by the fire after dinner.  We found a spot outside Roy's patio area.  Their outside firepit area gets a "5 star" but it's hard to give the staff that waited on us any type of compliment.  We waited at least 10 minutes before anyone even noticed us and there were plenty of servers outside.  Our group had to flag a waiter down to wait on us only to tell us, "he would find someone".  After another 5 minutes we had to just about "beg" someone to take our drink order.  When the waiter finally took our order he acted like he was doing us a favor.  The cosmos were good but servicde is something to be desired.I never thought my favorite class would be the gym, but I absolutely love it! The people who oversee the gym are very friendly, and encouraging. I have never seen too many people in the gym, it has always had a dozen or so or less in it, so it is comfortable. If you are thinking about a routine, this is a great place to get your start, they also have other classes you may like, such as yoga,track, belly-dancing or karate.  If it wasn't for the gym, I would have been long gone from this school from hell. 

As you can probably see by now, I am not a complete fan of the academics at MCC. I have taken around 30 credits here, and although I have a pretty decent GPA, some of the part-time online instructors are fairly 'feral' towards students( for some odd reason) which just messes up my degree plans.

  MCC has a 16% (or was it 14%?)  graduation rate. The lowest in the nation. You can see the statistics yourself if you log into your FAFSA. Who needs a degree- right? Obviously this is play time. (sarcasm) 

I'd say avoid the Religion at MCC, that one is a joke- save your money! I think it is ran by a bunch of secular-rabid-lesbian atheists.VISIT
Tuesday dinner service, main dining room

FOOD
On par with other NNY locations. Not great, but not bad. Although, my 7yo made a point to compliment the server on how much she liked the pretzel rolls on her sliders.

SERVICE
Friendly, but PAINFULLY slow. We sat for about 15 minutes before anybody greeted us or took our drink order. I felt abandoned many times. I had to sit there and stare at my salad (once I finally got it) for a while before they brought silverware. It took about 20 minutes between the time I said we were done and the time I got the bill, after reminding her once in-between. What should have been a 1 hour visit, easily turned into 2.

DECOR
In a word: depressing. I felt like I was sitting in my great grandmother's barn. It's just one, big, drab, loud, bright, dingy room. There were a couple pictures of New York on the wall, and some TVs. Otherwise, we might as well have been sitting in an elementary school cafeteria.

I will probably never go again -- not with the number of other great choices in the area.Breakfast isn't free,at courtyard. If you want that go Fairfield or Springhill Suites.  Book Marriott.com, package with breakfast if you want that at Courtyard, not priceline, etc.   Only Gold & platinum rewards members get free breakfast at courtyard, unless you book that room rate package including breakfast.  People stop complaining when you book thru priceline. Use marriott.com. guaranteed lowest rates and join marriott rewards online too.   This is not a newer hotel, it looks worse for wear.  We are not real comfortable here, as we are used to a more upscale or newer Courtyard.  Bathroom is small, carpets are worn, elevator has some issues.  I wouldn't come back.Groupon: So I purchase a groupon fro 3 oil changes and a tire rotation. Good deal! Although here is the catch....You lose your punch card and guess what? You lose your next 2 oil changes. You would think with computers in their building they could possibly keep track. Well out of their choice, they do not ,in hopes you loose it and now one oil change cost 35 bucks...Never going back!!!  Even if it was free. Little bit of integrity and honesty can really boost your business. Not the case here!= = = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =


This mid-sized buffet features a small selection of 25 food items.  The food is marginally ok but I think you're much better off to spend  just $.79 to $1.49 more down the the street at China Buffet, 1677 E. Florence.

Lunch Buffet $5.50, beer served.Meh! After reading the reviews and the number of times the wait was an hour or more, I expected much more. 
The pizza was not much better than Dominoes. The pasta was ok, and the service left a lot to be desired.I have been to two pita jungle locations. This one is probably the worse of the two. I have eaten in this establishment, ordered online, called for a to go orders, and ordered to go at the location itself. First I will start with the food. 

Food: I actually really like the food at Pita Jungle. Granted, I have only had 3 or so items off of the menu. The entree I get the most often is the Hummus and Tabbouleh salad with pita. I love their hummus. It is so creamy with the right amount of flavor. I always get a large order so I can have some for lunch the next day. The tabbouleh is ok. I have not had any other tabbouleh salad to compare it to, but usually I have to add my own flavorings because its pretty bland. Its parsley with cracked wheat, some tomatoes and onions. I usually squeeze some lemon juice on it, and then add the garlic and oil from my garlic mushrooms that I order (which I love. Garlic and mushrooms. Honestly, what's not to love?) as well to give it some extra flavor. If they did that on their own it would be great. Its also pretty watery so I have had to ask for it on the side, or extra dry. But this should be done automatically, because who wants watery tabbouleh sitting on top of hummus, which then also gets watery? Nobody! I have also had the falafel pita, which is ok. Sometimes the falafel balls have been really good, other times overcooked and almost burned. Its hit or miss. I have also had the 1000 beans. Pretty good. I have had the trio of hummus before but I prefer the original flavor. The roasted red pepper just didn't taste very good, and the jalapeno wasn't spicy at all. 

Eating in the restaurant: We have had a few different waiters. Usually when we have the guys they are more friendly. But the women that work here are rude and cold. We haven't had a problem with any of our food eating in the restaurant. But we have had to wait for long periods of time for our waiters to come around once in awhile. Even when it is not busy in here. Everyone here is apparently allowed to dress as they please. Last night I was in here and some girls bra was hanging out of her shirt. I am sorry, but nobody wants to see that when they are eating dinner. No matter how cute you think you look. Its trashy. They seriously need some sort of dress code in these places, even if its just jeans and a t-shirt that covers your boobs. 

Ordering online: There have been problems with this to the point I don't do it anymore. Some items they offer in the restaurant are missing from the options to choose from online. I have ordered online, gone to the store to pick up, and my order was missing. Then the girl who takes to go orders, called every single other pita jungle location in Arizona to find my order. Seriously? Just place a new order. There have also been times where I order something, and it didn't show up on my order, so I end up waiting around an extra 10 minutes because they have to make it after all of my other food has already been finished. I would say skip ordering online. 

Call in orders and ordering at the restaurant: The girl who is in charge of to go orders is extremely rude and snobby. She never says hello when we walk into the store. Just stares at us until we order. Uncomfortable. And then when we do order, she seems like its such a labor intensive job when we order 4 things. Get a grip girl. I have also ordered my tabbouleh on the side before and then I never got it, even though I paid for it. I didn't realize this until I was at home already and was pissed but not enough to go back and let my food get cold over a salad. I also have paid for pitas I have not received. Just make sure if you order to go, check your bag of food before you leave to make sure you have gotten everything you have paid for. They must tie their bags in a knot for this reason, they want to gip you and not have you check. I learned my lesson. I check every time now. 

I like the food (hummus) enough at Pita Jungle to keep coming back, but I should probably look for a more friendly location to frequent. This one just doesn't vibe well with me. So I will give this place 2 stars for the food. But 0 stars for everything else.I love Pita Jungle but we had stop for lunch today at this Chandler location.
The food was good, but the surrounding environment was not okay with me.

1. The girl sat down at a dirty table
2. Both bathrooms  (M&F)were very dirty
3. Some of the wait staff was in another world 
4. Leftover food on the patio deck and not pick up

I had asked one the wait staff to pick up the food from the deck and look at me like I was speak another language. After speaking with manager he did send someone over and it was finally taken care of. Where the common sense with food works today, and you is want better wages well take better care of your work environment so your customers would enjoy coming into your home to eat.

The manager also needs to be more visible and walk through his business or none of this would of happen.I am shock! 

Today I bought "Monica - Lapis Surabaya's" cake. The code is 751160. I sliced it at home and I found the moldy inside. You can't tell without you slice it. I ate 3 slices before I knew about the moldy, I hope I am OK..Lol.. 

Poor me! I should checked the expired date before I bought it (I should not forget again next time...LOL). It turned out that there's no expired date printed on the box. 

Still, I would like to go back to this place for fresh vegetables, meats, and anything else (as long there's expired date print on it...Lol).Its not often that one finds it actually painful to write a review, but this is one of those times.

Ninja has been one of my favorite places for years for all-you-can-eat sushi.  OK, so the fish isn't exactly what you'd get at Takashi in Manhattan, but it is always fresh and clean, making the $20 for all-you-can-eat one of the great bargains anywhere and the service was always quick, friendly, and helpful.

Unfortunately that all ended a couple of months ago.  A sushi restaurant can only be as good as it sushi-yas and it seems that Ninja has been having staffing issues.

My wife and I went there as usual a few weeks ago on a Saturday night, and as usual, the place was packed.  What was different was that I didn't recognize any of the sushi chefs.  They only had 2 guys working the sushi bar.

Shortly after being seated, a large group came in for teppenyaki and what do you know? The 2 sushi chefs became 1 as the other guy left to do his Benihana routine.  All you can eat is only significant if you can actually get some food.  There is no way in the world 1 guy can supply a room of 40 or so.  Simply can't be done.

I won't even go into how terrible our waitress was because she was new, avoided all contact with the tables because there was nothing she could do about the massive wait to get anything, and it is my understanding that she is no longer there.

OK. So anyone can have a bad night.  My wife and I went there again last week.  This time it was a Thursday and the room was nearly empty.  A different two sushi-yas behind the bar.  Should be OK, I thought.  I was wrong.

The first plate took over 45 minutes.  The reason is that although they had 2 sushi chefs, only 1 was actually producing anything.  The second, a very large bearded white guy in a black nylon do-rag produced a grand total of 1 roll during my first 45 minutes there.  But he was having a grand old time talking to one of the busboys so I got the impression that he couldn't be bothered with customers.

And in a repeat of our last visit, the service was also pathetic.  I sympathize with servers who are getting screwed by the kitchen, but that is no excuse for completely disappearing.  When our first plate finally did appear, it sat on the sushi bar for 10 minutes until my wife finally got fed up, got up and retrieved it herself.

That said, what we did get was great tasting as always.  If you go, you've got to try the 911 roll.  The fresh wasabi in it will make it hard to live with the powdered green horseradish ever again.

Can Ninja be fixed? Absolutely.  It is a staffing problem, not a food problem.  Coincidentally, there have been numerous Help Wanted postings on their Facebook page recently.

Also please note that this review does not include anything about the teppanyaki.  In all these years, I've never had it there.  For all I know it may be the best thing on the planet.You can never have a second chance to make a first impression.

I thought I would try this place out and support my local taco shop. Unfortunately I got screwed!

Ordered a Combo platter and a muchaca taco.m to go. They have me my combo platter w no rice and no beans then handed me bean tostada instead of a muchca taco. 

The food was very bland and had no cheese on the enchilada, tacos or the bean burrito. 

For a combo plate and an extra taco it cost me $13, I will not be back and only have it 2 stars because I likes the customer service, but the food sucked! Fast food would have been better..The experience would have been a lot more enjoyable if I wouldn't have had to get my own refill of water and eat chip crumbs. The chile rellenos and beef tacos are good though.Fun audio snippets overheard from other customers: "private equity," "When is YOUR next cruise?" and "What do you plan to do in Israel?"  So that gives an idea of the clientele. A nice place to relax.

Okay, the food:  I'm on a mission to find the best pastrami-on-rye  in the Valley.  The pastrami meat here is the best I've tasted.  Clean, flavorful, not salty.  And they pile on just the right amount.  

But -- ACK! -- here's the worst thing possible: The sandwich arrived with MAYONNAISE.  Really, I'm not kidding.  (I ordered the sandwich -- specifically -- with lettuce, tomato, onions and mustard.)  This is beyond "faux pas" for a Jewish deli, so I have go lower than the "A-OK" yelp defines for three stars and go with two.

Otherwise: The pickle was excellent and fresh and did not taste like salt, just good.  The bread the fell apart, a bit too dry and not a lot of "rye" flavor.  The red onion slices were about 1/4" inch thick, at least twice as thick as I prefer.I'm typically a Marriott girl, so staying at a Hilton was a stretch! I must say, even though the price was better here, I would still pay more for a Marriott property. The front desk receptionist didn't even know how to get back to the Villas, where we were staying. The Villa itself is nice, but that's about where it ends. Food at the restaurant is good; there is better elsewhere in Scottsdale. It is conveniently located though; and you can walk to The Good Egg in the strip mall adjacent. (Also - try Humble Pie!). The friendliest people there were the concierge (great golf recommendations) and the night person at the desk, who gladly split our bill between two couples. I wouldn't stay here again, unless it was another great deal.This establishment is walking distance from my home, my husband and I are also very committed to supporting the local economy, and therefore we wanted to purchase our bike from a bike shop as opposed to a chain store- even though her bikes cost on average $75-100 more for the same brand (Sports Authority at TMP has the same brand of Electra bikes for less, for example).

The owner Crystal was very kind and helpful in the research process, and let us ride the different bikes out back. The beach cruisers hurt my knees and so she directed us to a "Giant" brand bike where the pedals were a little farther back. I was still unsure and she recommended I try riding it longer to see. So I purchased the bike and a basket, and took it home and rode it around a little bit. The basket clinks against the bike rod (it doesn't fit correctly with the shape of the bike), and the bike still hurts my knees so we went back two days later to see about a trade-in or return, and she told us all sales were final. 

I expressed to her that it is bad business to have an "all sales final" without putting up signage, and also without even telling the customer at the time of purchase. I find this to be manipulative and dishonest. I did notice that the receipt she gave me after purchase did say "all sales final" on the top, however I did not get this until AFTER the purchase. 

So now I am stuck with a bike that hurts my knees, cost $375, plus a $35 basket that does not fit. In the future unfortunately, because of this unsavory experience, I will be purchasing all future bikes from mega retailers.Why is there a bar in the bagel shop?? This place is very disorganized. The placement of the bagels, coffees & creamers, chips, soda fountain, cream cheese and a full service bar.... They're in much need of a plan. Something about this place feels dirty to me. Not sure if its because it is so unorganized or the fact the bagels bins are hidden away.  Good I'd just okay but over priced. I think I purchased two bagels with strawberry cream chess and that was $12!I used to love this place when they first opened. But I have to say, that lately it seems as if they staff the store with exployees who just left Best Buy, they may seem like they know firearms to the inexperienced shooter, but for the most part they make it up as they go. Every time I go in there I have to fight someone to give them my money. I walked to 3 different registers with product in hand, but the people behind the counter were too busy having converstions to pay attention to me. I finally dropped my stuff on the counter and left. Only then did they pay attention. No worries, I went to US Autoweapons next door and dropped a couple hundred dollars. I let my membership lapse, the range is nice, but the staff are pretty hard to deal with.

Every time I would go in there, they would get my membership mixed up with my familys. It only took 2 years to get that straightened up. And their gunsmiths, forget it. And forget about ordering a gun and having it shipped there. The one time I did that, it had come from a dealer in another state and arrived in 24 hours. But they sat on it in the warehouse for 4 days before I could pick it up. Ordering a part for a gun was another 2 month ordeal. And a warranty return on a line of holsters they would carry took 2 weeks and 2 different managers. 

I used to spend a ton of money on shooting and the related accessories, and every time I try to like SGC. But it seems that their customer service gets worse with every single visit. They have the attitude that they have become so large, they don't need customers. I find that very frustrating, and a bad business move. Even more so when theres a shop 40 feet from their door that carries the same stuff, and is much more friendly. 

The only plus side is they are sometimes the only local store to carry certain items. But I find myself ordering more and more stuff on of the internet.It is like a parallel bizarre universe, you walk in everything seems familiar but not quite right.

This is what Sams club is, it is like costco, but just not nearly as good, lower quality products, a odd selection, useless staff and a lack of customers as a result.

The only highlight of this store is the Hummus, they sell Sabra hummus in large family size containers for a bargain at $6. I did see a recent addition of a house brand and I hope this is not a sign of change.

If you want a sample you are out of luck too, despite there only being a hand full of other customers, the sample people are painfully slow, and do not create a cache of samples to buffer demand.

I walked around and just felt odd and out of place. Also prices on some items are much higher than other places. A 1.75 of Makers Mark  Bourbon was $35 when it can be had for $27 at Costco.

Unless you have Agoraphobia there is no real reason to shop here.Wow!? Where to start?. Almost 10 years in invisalign, which I wore religiously, including 6 months of metal braces, during my last 2 years of treatment. After my first consultation, Dr. Brigham   told me 2-3 years in invisalign!  I finally had the upper retainer attached less than 3 months ago and was discharged, when the metal retainer snapped in half. Was told by Dr. Brigham that he "had never seen that happen before"! So what does he do? No problem I 'll just charge you almost $800 to straighten the misaligned tooth and redo the retainer that was either defective or installed improperly!!?? I can not believe it, after 10 years of visits 1 to 2 times a month, and he won't warranty his work past 3 months? I can understand if the band broke 1 to 2 years later, but not 3 months. I am disappointed. I guess he makes his money when you have to come back 3 times a year to have repairs done. I expected better and wish I just had regular braces in the begining, then I would have been done in 2005 and not have to deal with this headache! Thanks Dr. B!The best part of this place is the wait staff. They make the place and it's a good thing because the food seems to be deteriorating with every visit. It is close to home, so I am hoping that they improve the food.I honestly don't understand why this place gets such good reviews.  OK, it has some kitschy charm to it, but the food is far from fantastic for what you pay for it.

I ordered the filet mignon, medium-rare and it came out essentially burnt.  My wife ordered the salmon, which was so over-cooked that it was actually starting to dry out.  I hadn't realized before that you could dry out such an oily fish.  To top it off, my baked potato was far from being finished baking.

Long-story short, if you want to see some "interesting" decorations, knock yourself out, but don't go there expecting to have a memorable meal.I usually go to the good egg at thunderbird and Scottsdale road and love it but tried the boulder location since I was in the area. Sat out on the patio and it is a beautiful setting besides the bird problem, they are a little aggressive and clean the plates when customers get up to leave. Service was a little slow but it was early so they probably had not got in the swing of things. Ordered eggs over easy with whole wheat toast dry. It came fast but eggs were scrambled with white bread. I asked server and she said they were out of whole wheat and if I wanted her to she would fix the eggs but her attitude was the worst. Made me feel like I unconvinced her by the question. Not a great experience. Asked manager as I paid on the way out and she said they had plenty of wheat. Will stick with thunderbird location from now onI used to be a big fan of Nellos but they are really cheapskating these days.   Ordered 2 Extra large pizzas(supposed to be 14" but only measures 12") for take out.  I guess they measure the crust going up one inch on each side but its the smallest 14" pizza Ive ever seen and the pepperoni pizza had very sparse toppings like half of what anyplace else gives.   I still like the taste of the pizza but what a ripoff this place is these days.   Called to complain about my 12" pizza after ordering the 14"s and they told me to order another on if its not enough.   Never again!This was my first visit. I had heard good things, so maybe my expectations were set too high. My boyfriend and I decided to share a few items: small ceasar salad, 10 inch wing pizza, and an order of angel hair pasta with marinara sauce. The ceasar was good, the dressing was not overly creamy or heavy, it actually had a hint of spice to it,  which I liked a lot. Next came the pasta dish. I was really looking forward to this dish, so I was disappointed when all of the angel hair was basically sitting in a puddle of water with globs of marinara dispersed throughout the bowl. I'm sure the actual marinara was good, but it was almost impossible to taste due to all the water in the bowl. The pizza was definitely the highlight of the meal. Thick, deep crust pizza with good chunks of buffalo chicken. Overall, their food is ok, I'd just stick with the pizza. I would, however, like to note that my overall dining experience was not that great and is really the reason I probably wouldn't come back. We were sat at the far booth in the bar area. There was a smaller cocktail table situated within 2 feet of my seat. Right after being sat,  a man who I presume to be the owner or off duty manager sat down at that table with his beer. Nothing wrong with that. Except that throughout our 45 min or so visit, the man and his employees were conversing about their Christmas parties, wedding plans, and work drama/gossip that I honestly didn't care to hear about as a patron, but couldn't help to hear because of their proximity to us. Kinda killed the vibe we were going for and made us want to leave as quickly as possible. I'm in the industry myself, and I totally understand grabbing a beer and unwinding after work,  but not at the expense of the customers' experience.I was very disappointed. My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary and we will never go back. The weigh-tress forgot to bring us bread after being asked several times, she was slow on ordering our appetizer, and forgot to bring out our dinner. Another weightier had to go get it, and by the time we received it, it was cold. I ordered fish and the piece was smaller than my palm. The quality, quantity, and service was not worth the price. It's too bad. The location is beautifulWent here Friday night for some yummy Indian food, and it was okay.  We ordered 3 dishes for 3 people and 2 orders of the garlic naan bread.  I thought it was fairly overpriced for what we got.  We paid $53 for everything, and they only gave us 1 order of the naan bread.  I remember this place being a lot better than it was.  I have never dined in, but I don't think I would want to.  It had an odd smell, and the tables were pretty dirty for being "clean".DISAPPOINTED!
Saturday afternoon was my third visit to this restaurant. The first trip was the best, 2nd was OK, and this last visit was a disappointment. We were looking forward to having BBQ for an early Saturday dinner after going to a spring training game in Peoria. We get there and about 4 different people told us they would be with us in a minute. Once we were finally seated by a teenager who didn't seem to know how to interact with people, (for example she laid out silverware in front of our 14 month old), for anyone reading this who is wait staff, DON'T DO THAT! 

Anyway, we looked at the menu and knew what we wanted since we had been before. I got the Pork n Slaw sandwich with mashed potatoes, my husband got the 3 meat combo, brisket, pork and ribs, with slaw and fries and we ordered mac n cheese for our little one. Once the food came out, I was annoyed to say the least. The mac and cheese, (which was $4.50), was KRAFT MAC N CHEESE out of a box that I have never served my child (I make my own!). So the waitress comes back and I ask, um, what is this? Don't you have homemade mac n cheese, and she responds with, Um normally but we ran out. Mind you it was 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon, how does a BBQ joint run out of mac n cheese before Saturday night even starts??? 

My sandwich was OK, not as good as it was the time before. The seem to skimp on the slaw.  The mashed potatoes were not good. Gravy was way too salty for my taste. My husbands food was OK as well. The ribs were good, pork was good, brisket was tough. The fries seemed over seasoned (too salty) and the slaw was good. They have too many sides. If they would focus on what they are good at making, that would be better. 

Any-who, for a restaurant that was featured on food network, I would expect more. Maybe they have gotten cocky and are letting things slip. Who knows. I just know the wait staff is mediocre at best. We have had the same waitress every-time, and she gets worse every-time! That will be our last visit to Thee Pitts Again. We will resume going to our favorite local BBQ joint, Joe's BBQ in Gilbert. The line is out the door and they never run out of anything!My boyfriend and I tried the sampler platter. Pork ribs, beef ribs, brisket, chicken, chopped pork and pulled pork. We ordered 4 sides : coleslaw, Mac&cheese, beans and fries. We also ordered fried pickles as an appetizer. Of the many items that were ordered, the only thing worth paying for were the fried pickles. The worst was the pulled pork. It tasted like what I'd imagine canned dog food tastes like. Everything else was sub par.a lot of tacky decor
a lot of average wait help
a lot of messiness in the bathroom
a lot a lot of very average food
and...
a lot of old peopleDon't go here right when they open they seem to have an attitude that they have to make pizza. At least everyone that came in got the same great treatment.*********PRICEY IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT**************

The food is OK ...... not outstanding.
The Wait staff ....... is a bit above average.
The menu .......... they believe they're akin to Morton's Steak House.
       Salad is EXTRA
       Average entree price $21
My peppered crusted sirloin was $20.50
*********The steak was TOUGH & CHEWY...... FIT FOR A BEAVER.***************
 
Would I come back, for another try ????????
..........not unless I had a pet Beaver.


My Ethics .... My Standards:
Every business starts with one star ..... GETTING MORE .... HAS TO BE EARNED.Chips are stale and some were quite rubbery. I think they are cooking them in too low of a temperature oil. Salsa is delicious though. A great chipotle flavor to the hot salsa.
I had the two taco meal. One chicken and one shredded beef. They were ok. Nothing to rave about. Overall, a solid 2 star place. Worth the money I guess.I have decided not to go there again.  It's a chain that's totally west coast, so as a native west coaster, I've been going there for decades.  
BUT the service is crap!  Every time we go it's a hassle.  It's a hassle to get the attention of the host.  It's a hassle to order your food.  They don't know who the check goes to as they passed around some poor guy's credit card to three tables b/f they got it right.  
For mother's day, we left after an hour of not getting the food while we had kids!  Seriously, WTF!  
Time to order out for Mimi's!  That took 15 minutes.  Mimi's it is!(My fiancee and I stayed here 3 1/2 weeks ago. I'm just going to be brief and go over the pros and cons of the place because it was nice, but not "great"; we'll probably stay here again if we can't find a better option-)

Cons:

1.The Weather: 

Be warned! Vegas is a *desert*: We went in May thinking it's be cool-ish and mild-ish: It wasn't!! It was very muggy (It rained) and very, very windy-felt like the inside of a hairdryer every time we went outside; the hot, high winds (Gusts up to 60+ mph) made "walking the strip" very unenjoyable. Our bad and we'll more than likely not go there between the months of May-August next time, but still; I hate being cramped up inside! :/

2. Our Trip (Cut Short due to the Weather): 2 stars off

My fiancee and I were booked here for 4 days but ended up leaving a day early due to inclement weather. I know it's not fair of me to take a couple of stars off, but we had really been looking forward to relaxing poolside and getting a cabana each day, only to find the pool open only 1 day out of what would've been 4: Blah. :/

3. The Weird WIFI and "Fine Print Resort Fee" Charges: 1 star off

Additionally, they have this Game that they play where they "say" you get "Free WIFI" in your Room but you're charged the fee for it and it's "taken" out of your Resort Fee at the end...something like a charge-back it was explained to us..Yeah, okay, sure sounds shady...BUT I want to clearly state that after looking over our statement after our Trip, we were charged-back the WIFI fees..but we had this nagging, in-the-background-uncomfortable, "will they charge it back or not" feeling, which put a small damper on our enjoyment. I also think that they should've been way, way more "upfront" about the Resort Fee vs. making it a "fine print" item that you kind've..discover upon checking in. :/

Pros:

1. The Oyster Bar: Pretty decent, I've had better, but not bad for Vegas.

2. No nasty smoke smell

3. Clean, quite rooms (Albeit slightly worn down)

All in all, my fiancee adores this Casino and wants to stay here again. Me, not so much; there's plenty of other places to stay that I'd like to check out...It was my sister-in-law Judy's birthday and Mimi's is where she picked. I've been to Mimi's once before and had a good experience, but this time not so good. Our group had arrived before we got there and had ordered drinks, just water, but when we came our waiter never asked us if we wanted something to drink. When our waiter finally came over  I quickly made my order which was a warm turkey sandwich with Brie cheese, green apple, with apricot preserves on a croissant. Sounded right up my alley cause I've been on a huge Brie kick! The waiter asked if fries were OK and I said yes, assuming that's what came with it. Found out later I could have had a salad instead. I was very disappointed in my sandwich, but I was happy the apricot preserves came on the side cause they were gross. The croissant was crumbling and dry. I doubt there was any Brie on the sandwich at all. Overall I ended up ditching the croissant and just eating the meat and apples. The fries were also meh. 

Everyone else in my group enjoyed their food. My Husband and brother-in-law got the Le Burger de Madame. It wasn't cooked medium like my husband requested, but well done. He also mentioned that the fried egg was popped and leaking a bit. My mother and sister-in-law both got the Quiche Lorraine which they had salads with. The Quiche has bacon and Swiss cheese running threw it. Looked very tasty. My other sister-in-law had the Fall Harvest Salad which had honey walnuts, cranberries and a bed of greens with a Honey Dijon Vinaigrette. She said it was very good and she even finished the whole salad.

Maybe it was just an off day, but I've had better. For the price and discription I expected a really good sandwich, but I was sadly let down. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back anytime soon.I hate shopping at Walmart but it's one of the few places I can afford.Seemed like a dirty Wendys

Obviously food is always good, but i didnt like the feel of this place. Next time if i have to stop here ill just use the drive thru.I avoid this walmart at all costs. The night crew is pretty nice, but it's constantly in disarray. It has alot of products and is usually well stocked, but no exaggeration there are never enough lanes open. Anytime from a Sunday afternoon to a Tuesday night, checking out of this Walmart is like one of the circles of hellSo it seems like this Target is a bit on the ghetto side. First time I came here the cashier/manager said I can not purchase more then 1 sale item. Which was BS I called Target and they said there is no such policy. Maybe the guy didn't like me or was racist towards me or something I dunno.  
2nd trip here 2 cashiers, 3 customers, and manager on duty was arguing about fake coupons the customers was trying to use etc.. There was a lot of yelling and slowing the line down. sigh
3rd trip here nothing happened which was good. The store is clean & stocked. But not a lot of works around to ask for help.I am becoming less and less fond of Anthem Pediatrics, and their billing/records department.

My daughter was born on 12/31/12, I had not picked a pediatrician, and Dr. Vu was the pediatrician on call that night at St. Rose hospital. He was friendly, informative, and my husband liked him. I decided on him for our pediatrician.
I do agree that the doctors there are pretty illusive, and I have seen the nurse more than I have seen Dr. Vu himself.

But, on to my annoyance with their billing department. Today, 7/25/13, I get a bill from them for $350. For the dates 12/31 and 1/1.... yes, seven months ago, from when we were in the hospital.

They have been submitting this to my insurance, and every time they do, I get notice from my insurance. AND EVERY TIME, my insurance tells me that I owe them, the provider $0.00.

The insurance has also stated that appropriate codes need to be submitted.
Now, my insurance covered my birth, and my daughter's first two days of life.

I have written a letter that will be sent out tomorrow 7/26/13 telling Anthem Pediatrics that I will not be paying this bill until I get denial from my insurance company.  At this time, I feel that I have no other choice but to withdraw my daughter from the care of Anthem Pediatrics and Dr. Vu. I have asked for her records to be released.

I see here a parent that says that her and her husband don't have insurance, and pay $55 for an office visit. I find it funny that we are in the same boat, and we pay *******$100****** every time we step into that office!

8/31/2013
Still NO RESPONSE FROM ANTHEM PEDIATRICS.
Still don't have my daughter's records.

9/12/13
I get a phone call from a "Kerri", who works at the rainbow office. She says that my insurance, has given them denial over the phone. Sooo....she has denial, but I don't...? I will handle that with my insurance company.

Kerri says that they would send me a discounted bill, along with the woman from the insurance representative that she spoke with.

9/20/13
I receive the updated invoice from Anthem Pediatrics,
***but no name of the insurance rep. that Kerri spoke to, 
**or my daughter's records.

10/2/13
I finally have my daughter's records, after two months (asked on 7/26/13) ......Seriously.Dang how in the heck can you work in a theater and not know about the movies playing.  Its 2011, please stop being cheap and have paper towels in the bathroom. Popcorn was ok i should have went to Popcorn girl and brought my own(pissed i couldn't really eat it due to the smell). The only thing that was good was the movie hangover 2. I enjoyed the movie but since it was packed and some *ick-head had his feet all on my seat. (yeah i gave him the eye several times but I guess he was to dum to figure out  the deal-he got me on a good night). The smell was so foul he had my eyes and nose burning. (Man he needs to spray some big Oomp spray or something on those dogs, and the theater @the same time.) All and all i may need to continue to drive to fiesta or go early on tuesday.  

They better be glad i don't know any movies man around here- because I could have gotten the 2 for 1 deal on the streets.(jk)This office was on my dental plan's list. Extremely unhelpful, and unfriendly front office. Before my appointment I called for their pricing on amalgam and composite fillings (knowing dental coverage varies on composites vs amalgam) so that I may estimate my out of pocket cost. Something many other dental offices have done for me over the years. They are contracted to charge a set amount. Even "out of network" ,or dentist not on my plan's list, have been able to provide this information. I was informed that they could not give me that infomation or even the cost of the office visit. The response did not sound right  so I  requested to speak to the office manager. I was told that manager was not available.  I called back hours later, still not allowed to speak to an office manager and was now informed that because I had a question about their contract pricing with my insurance,  I would now have to pay for all services upfront and submit for reimbursement. I was never allowed to speak to an office manager. My questions were routine and pertinent to their daily business. Inefficiency and poor customer service is driving clients away. No wonder I was able to get in with in 24 hours when most others were booked.Came in as we saw the dollar cone special and ordered 4 cones including 2 kids.  They never mentioned until after the check out that they were giving us regular cones and only the kids cones were a dollar.  Yes we should have read more careful or even asked but I would have hoped they would have been more heads up about this when ordering kids size cones especially when it was 3x the cost it would be evident it wouldn't make sense to order in this manner.Burgers are ok. The ribeye and mashed potatoes were flavorless. Stay in the restaurant area, your clothes will smell like smoke in the bar. The waitstaff and bartenders are cool. I probably won't be back.First I had to figure out how to get upstairs to this place.  When I walked in I was immediately confronted with a one of those room dividers, except is is installed so close to the door that I can't imagine some fire code isn't being violated.  I didn't find the servers to be particularly friendly. I was getting take out and no one advised me about where to go to place my order, where to wait for it, etc.  After waiting a while I finally sat down at a big empty table. I was soon joined by a couple of of the staff eating during their break. I couldn't tell if they were annoyed by my sitting there, but I stayed seated until my order arrived.

The pho was fine but a bit pricey. I liked that they separated the noodles, basil and bean sprouts so they could be added to the broth separately.  The flavor was all right. I'm not itching to come back here when there is a better pho place down the street, though.We had booked a room @ TI but decided to go w/ Palace Station because it was cheaper and in a central location. I really wish we would've just kept our previous reservations. 

The staff was less than friendly (especially when checking in). They also take another $100 when you get there in case you "trash the room. They give it back to you when you check out, but until then be prepared to be out $100. Plus they keep their ridiculous $13.something-a-night "amenity fee" to use the pool, get shuttle service, etc. And if you use none of these, tough crap.

Anyhow, we had courtyard rooms & had to walk what felt like forever to get to our room. We were right by the pool and because of it we ended up w/ crickets & ants in our bathroom. The shower space was ridiculous & you cannot comfortable turn around. I'm not sure about some of you, but I like to soap thoroughly and these were NOT the showers to do it in. Not to mention when I went to get a shower, I almost fell because the tile on the shower floor is kind of slippery when wet. The bedspread smelled like it hadn't been properly washed from the previous user, it smelled horribly of perfume. 

I'm definitely not eager to stay here again anytime soon. If the tower suites are better, I'd give it another try...but again, not any time soon.The hotel isn't bad considering it's catering to the more mature audience.  The only thing that somewhat upsets me is that the price of the rooms are misleading.  You better read the fine print when reserving a room here because they might not inform you about the $14.95 per night surcharge.  Me and my friends wanted to find a fairly inexpensive hotel and when we booked online on expedia, the rooms were only $42/night.  But when we got there, we were informed of the ridiculous surcharge.  I can understand if it was something like $5.00 or something but $14.95?? If it was still summer time when we can at least use their ugly pool, i can also at least understand that.  I mean, even the GOLD COAST which is much more decent than Palace Station has a surcharge of only $3.00!  Okay, live and learn i guess.  Well, at least whoever is reading this could use the heads up, right? :)What I love about this place is that it opens late.

And that's about it. After that everything goes downhill from there. The food was okay, but I have had better from other izakaya places in the OC, like Honda-ya or Shinsengumi. The service was bad, the couple that came in 15 minutes after my husband and I had placed our order actually got their food before us. And they messed up our order too. We were served the wrong ramen and our server kept looking at her colleagues at the counter to see if she should be serving us our spider roll. And she kept putting down the plate and picking up the plate. THRICE. -_-

When we asked for the bill, I noticed that someone had tried to add a spider roll to our order, but it was canceled before the bill was given to us. And that was when the spider roll was the first item on a two item order.

So never again Ichiza. You guys messed up!I USED TO love this place.  I USED TO enjoy coming here and even have to wait for a table to open up.  The service USED TO be better!!!  However, my friends and I have noticed a BIG decline in their service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The servers (mainly women) "pretend" to NOT understand what you say or ask for.  I think it is ridiculous that after you have been seated, you have to wait more than 15 minutes before someone even comes up to your table to take your drink order, much less your food order...which we always already know what we want to order since we have been regulars here for a long time now and always take guests from out-of-town for the food.  Don't get me wrong, the food is still great, which is the only reason that I still come.  But food quality and busyness of the establishment IS NOT AN EXCUSE FOR BAD SERVICE!!!!!!!  This review is clearly all over the place, but I am extremely angered and disappointed about my experience here with a friend last night, because we came specifically for the food, which we were craving!!!!!  But what did we get, BAD SERVICE again!!!

First of all, after we were seated, we made several attempts to try to get a server's attention (and even the guy at the front who looked like he was in charge of seating people, and also the same guy who made eye contact with my friend who was trying to motion him that we were ready to order but just seemed to ignore us for the next 10 minutes).  Finally, we got the attention of a server to let her know that we were ready to order, so she went and got another server to take our order, who then never came back to check on us the rest of the night.  Their wait staff just seems so disorganized, because different girls kept walking by and our food was brought out to us by various girls.  We ordered our food all at once because we knew it would take a long time to get a second order in if we wanted.  Our food came, some items before others; so we ate, pretty much taking our time and enjoying our food, during which time no one came up to ask if we needed anything or to refill our waters or my hot tea.......but instead, three times three different servers did come up to take a bowl that was pretty much empty but had more sauce in it which we were still working on, but without asking if we were done with it and just trying to take it off our table.  I mean, JUST ASK FIRST if we are done before taking plates away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  SO ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Then, we still had two more dishes that we were waiting for, which my friend had asked two servers to please check on the remainder of our order.  But I don't think they even did.  Because when we were almost done with our meal and pretty much full, we still hadn't gotten our last two dishes.  So, my friend asked another server to cancel our orders of the tempura and butterfish (which the girl said, "ok let me check"....but we countered and said, "can you just please cancel the orders because he have been waiting for it and we are almost done eating here").....but she still went to go check on the order (which again, we had asked them two times prior to check on while we were mid-way thru our meal)......then immediately, she came back with both dishes.  My response to her was "oh, how convenient that when we are almost done and ask to cancel our order, you bring it out right away"....she just smiled and shrugged.  OBVIOUSLY, they hadn't forgotten about our order, because she brought them out too quickly, which made us believe that our food had been done and it was simply due to the sloppy service and inattentiveness that they brought the rest of our order to us that late......much less why my friend's shrimp tempura was already soggy when she got it!  INEXCUSABLE SERVICE, which is why we didn't feel the least bit sorry when we decided to leave a tip of less than 10% of the bill.

I MEAN REALLY....... I totally get that you guys are always busy.  But you should already be used to it and train your employees better, as far as being more organized and ready for such a rush.  Also, with that many people on staff (I'm thinking there were at least six servers last night, which if you think about how small the place is, should be enough to cover the tables and provide better service and attention to your customers), no one should experience such CRAPPY SERVICE!!!!!!  

I now come for the food alone and NEVER WILL I EXPECT GOOD SERVICE FROM ICHIZA'S.......which overall should make for a bad review!

Places like this, who really have a huge following and whose food is exceptional and worthy of coming back to, should be ashamed when they don't deliver in quality of service....and even more so when their SERVICE SUCKS OVERALL!!!!!!!We ventured into Sam Woo, lured in by the sight of luscious Hong Kong style bbq meats hanging near the window, and the plethora of Asian families eating here on a weekend for dinner.  We walked in, and immediately saw the "Cash Only" sign.  Luckily, we had enough cash to cover our charges for 4 people.  Once seated, we placed our orders, and were struck by how expensive everything was, especially for an establishment that is cash only.  The meal itself, was adequate.  We ordered a 3 bbq meat combo (Approx. $14) and I was expecting to see 3 dishes filled with 3 separate meats.  But, instead we were served a small plate with thinly sliced, smallish pieces of meat.  We also had wintermelon soup, which hit the spot to warm us up on that chilly night.  We shared some snow pea tips and braised tofu as well, which were OK.  

At the end of the meal we received our check, and did a double take when we saw that they added in tip automatically for our party of 4.  While we were somewhat annoyed that they had already added tip for a party that I wouldn't consider large, we were also amused that their additional tip was only 10%.  I guess they don't think much of their own service if they only give out 10% to the automatic tips!I find it difficult to believe that this store is still here.

Not because it is a bad store, per se. But because not much has really changed. In years. And too much change in a used bookstore can be a problem. But in this case, change would infuse it with a bit of life. Which it sorely needs now. It needs that zest of a great conversationalist at the front. Or the turnover of many great books. And not just being a paperback rotational gallery. Even a change of decor would help ( though I do give props to the papermache' banana that persists up on the shelf top ). I'm not really sure what bothers me so much.

Let's examine this:

The parking lot is situated in such a way you have to dive in and out onto a busy Charleston by the UMC. Not the easiest thing to do. Hint: if you must go, do so by the back entrance. 

The same books go round and round and if you find something to take home, it will be way out of line with any online prices or other used stores prices. That does irk me some. And I do get itchy being surrounded by that many romance books.

Actually I think I know the problem. There isn't much vibrancy in staffing. Cheryl is cool, once you get to know her. But that's about it. Other help is too temporary to make a mark or move on to more hours elsewhere. The one way used stores stand out is if the staff is really helping you find that treasure you weren't even sure you were looking for. 

So while this place has lost some charm, it is worth checking out infrequently. It isn't just paperbacks and does have some size. might be some treasure in there after all.Short: Pass on it, go to Krazy Buffet or any other place. Sub-average food, bad service, terrible atmosphere.

I dropped by here because I felt a little tired of the other asian buffets I visit, and it was in the neighborhood. $6.48 for lunch for one. I walked in and was sat down promptly, but that was about it for service other than plate pick up. Crappy decorations--a staple of low-scale asian buffets--but absolutely no music playing to drown out the coughing, children's cries and random conversation. It felt like I was eating in a run-down restaurant on the side of a highway.
Food was cooked at least.... It's the typical spread you'll see at any other buffet, just not as good. All sauces were watered down to the point that one tasted like all the others. I'd guess that half of the selection of "hot" food was previously frozen, and the other half showed that it wasn't made very well. Half of the buffet is made up of soups, the worse of deserts, fruit and a pretty bad "Mongolian BBQ" side-bar. I wasn't tempted to try the sushi--though I typically risk it.


Bottom line: If you've been to an asian buffet before, this place will disappoint you. It's one of the worse I've been to, and I see no reason why someone should go here when there's a dozen others that are better in this city.Hopefully I'll be updating this review after another try. We ordered about 5 different menu items around 11pm, the food arrived quickly, but it was not surprisingly below par. The lasagna was literally like a marinara sauce soup, in which I had trouble finding actual pasta or meat. The bread was pretty stale and plain, the pizza was very average to below average, and the wings were decent at best.


Honestly, I'd still recommend this for late night based purely on it being food and having delivery available.Tea Station is consistently good for me, but this one was a little pricey compared to the others. First of all, parking was easy. Being from LA-- this has to be mentioned.

I get the curry chicken and rice = great but the drinks is where they shine. Boba milk tea and blueberry green tea are good but for $6+ each ... yeah, no thanks.

There are cheaper, more delicious places. Sorry, Tea Station.I came here with a bachelorette party, 9 of us total.

The men -- there were some really really gorgeous guys.  No, not gorgeous, HOT guys.  Great bodies, great moves -- but I can only remember 2 really hot guys and none of them were particularly NICE.  Some of them were just aggressive assholes.  A lot of the guys looked over 40 and not in a sexy George Clooney "distinguished" flattering way.  

The dances -- they were much more raunchy than female dancers.  There's a lot of banana hammocks.  It made me think of impressionism -- good from far... yea, you know the rest.  One guy in particular really needed to ex-foliate their ass (according to a friend).  That's the opposite of sexy

The cost -- HOLY SHIT these guys are shady.  This place felt too mechanical and too shady.  I don't think you'd suspect it at first -- but when we got in we were greeted by a line up of guys.  They seemed friendly at first, but no money no honey.  There was one friendly guy (Asian guy) but all the other dudes seemed way more interested in screwing you over than pretending to want to screw you.

First, the guys would take money from out of your hand, put it in your mouth or your dress and then work for it.  Ummm, no it doesn't work that way.  Next, they would just take money from the table by the stage.  What the fuck?  Thirdly, I had one guy rub up against me only to find that he stole a $20 voucher a friend had slipped into my dress.  Yea, sly.  The worst was a guy asking my friend sitting next to me if it was ok if I bought her a dance.  Um, sure I'll buy her a dance but because I wanted to, not because you pressured me.  The worst part? Guess who never got her dance?

It was fun, but don't go there too drunk and set a budget for yourself.  Hold on to your cash closely!



Ok, downstairs, the girls? from what I could tell the girls were really hot.  I only sat for a little bit but they paid more attention to the guys than me.  So I took my cash and left.This place was not great. Quality of items not up to par with what I'm used to at other Savers locations. I never leave empty handed at a thrift store, and if I do, it's because I figure I've been shopping too much lately (but have something in mind I would get otherwise). This place had absolutely nothing that interested me whatsoever. I was so disappointed! I may go back today and give it another shot, but this was more full of junky items than any other thrift store I've ever been to.Meh, was craving Mexican food after being out in Vegas for more than a month.  Growing up in Texas, and now living in California, I have pretty high standards when it comes to good Mexican food.

Menu items of note:

Machaca plate - the shredded beef was just OK, pretty plain tasting

Chips and Salsa - a rip-off, chips were a bit stale, and of course they don't mention that the 'salsa' that they give you is the same stuff that is free at the bar.  Didn't even have pico de gallo to give me instead.

Service:
Hard to gauge, cause I went there at 6:30 in the morning and was the only customer.

Reasons why I come here:
Needed a Mexican food fix, but instead left unsatisfied.  Found out a week later that Ricardo's was near me and is a much better option.Had some trouble with the order radio so we went in to order. We got food to feed a family of 5 so, with  no one else in line or in the store, we went through it with the cashier, took our time and paid. The floor in front and back was in need of a sweep an mop. There were a couple trainees on the food line so it took some time. No biggie. Left and Had to come back because we were missing 5 items. Polite trainees but really unpleasant manager. Finally left with a refund for one drink and the missing tacos and burrito. Corporate needs to drop in on this bunch more frequently, especially the evening crew. Clean it up a bit and get a manager who is comfortable leading a team.The Tom Yum Goong here was good.  It had a great balance of hot and sour, along with generous portions of mushroom, tomato and shrimp.  At spice level 3 out of 5 my lips felt some fire, but my tongue didn't taste much heat.  With this being the first dish brought out, I felt that it was a strong start to the meal.  The other highlight of the night were the Chop Chop Original Thai-Style Chicken Wings.  The sauce was good; the chicken, not so much.

My palate and experience for Thai food is admitedly limited, since I always like to order Panang Curry and Pad See Ew whenever I'm at a Thai restaurant.  Due to that habit I've come to form my own expectations for these two dishes, and those expectations were not met at Mr. Chop Chop.  The Panang Curry had a sweet flavor, and the Pad See Ew tasted like noodles that were just heated up; not much flavor was present.

One thing that was different about this meal was that each dish came out on it's own, as if each dish was it's own course.  We were at the restaurant for two hours, and much of that time was spent eating.  Out of the five dishes we ordered, four of them were ordered at the same time at the beginning.  I don't know if they usually serve their food one dish at a time, but I was definitely expecting most of the food to come out together.  Two stars says it all: I've experienced better.I've used this dry cleaner for years. Their dry cleaning is fine (they send it out), but not especially inexpensive or fast. I'd give 3 stars if it weren't for their tailoring. It's terrible! I brought in 2 curtain panels and asked them to simply remove the rod pocket on one and hem them together so they create one long panel. They didn't remove the pocket, and just sort of ran several seams over it to mash it all together. It's terribly crooked and they used a totally different color of thread. On top of that, they charged an outrageous amount to do this simple task - $35!!  I am not even going back to see if they can fix it. I went to another nearby cleaner with 2 other panels and got exactly what I wanted done, neatly and cleanly, for $15. Needless to say, I won't be going back- not even for my dry cleaning.I have stayed here many times, but I will now find somewhere else to stay.

The front desk people are never very friendly.  

Our first room of this last visit was nasty.  The bathroom tile was coming up and the door hinges were rusty and the paint was coming off the wall near the tub.  The tub had grout coming off.  No continuing maintenance is going on.  
Our A/C did not work and we had to be transferred at 11:30 pm to another room.  This means that the maid did not report it not working or that they did not fix it.

Our second room was almost as bad.  The bathroom was in the same sorry shape, but the room was nicer.  

The Casino is always fun and great priced for being small and off the strip.  The pool can get a little crowded, but the pool bar and hooters restaurant overlooking the pool are fun.

I won't be back until some remodel is done.  Going to try the "New" Tropicana.Not good I'm afraid,, I was rudely awakened by a maid bumping his vacuum on my door repeatedly at 9am and when I finely decided to get up and open the door the guy just had a smile on his face and I said what the f--ks up with banging on my door at 9am and all he said he was "it wasn't him" WTF?? I called downstairs and was put on hold , I waited and waited and my call was not taken after two tries so I go downstairs to jump in somebody's ass and all I get was a the run around ,The supervisor Said I could have a late checkout and assured me no one else would bother me and he would call housekeeping and let Them know not to knock,, what happens !! The maid walks in on me just as i was falling back asleep:-( guess that's why this place is on its way down. Iv stayed here lots and lots of times over the passed few years and I think Iv stayed there for the last time.. I served in Baghdad and was treated better:-/this is for our stay on the weekend of July 13, 2013

I thought about giving one star, but decided to give two, only because it is affordable.  I didn't expect much either because of the affordable price.  you shouldn't expect much either.

CANCELLATIONS - a few nights before, we almost had to cancel our plans to vegas .... I called really late evening (around 1130pm) to cancel our reservation, and the operator was plain rude.  we reserved through expedia and expedia gave us their confirmation number and the hotel confirmation number.  my confirmation email specifically said to cancel through the hotel, and when you click the link, it takes you directly to hooters and gives you hooters number to call for cancellation.  it also says to cancel before midnight to to avoid any other fees.  I call at 1130pm, but the rude operator told me reservations are closed at this time and I'd have to call back in the morning??  she also told me rudely that i have to cancel through expedia, and after i told her expedia directed me to hooters, that's when she told me to call back in the morning (to speak to someone who actually knew the answers).  whatever ..... thank goodness we found out our plans came through, so VEGAS HERE WE COME!!

CHECK IN - we checked in on a thursday around 5pm.  not busy at all.  of course, the girl (not lady) at the front desk didn't seem happy about working here.  not welcoming, no smile .... again, whatever .... WE MADE IT TO VEGAS!! 

HOTEL APPEARANCE - filthy elevators (garage and hotel elevators) .... the elevator doors to your hotel room are just nasty.  like housekeeping hasn't wiped them down in years .....I thought it would be wiped down by the next morning ..... nope!  filthy the whole time.  garage elevators seem like they will drop with you in it any time .... again, whatever .... I wasn't expecting much for an average $56 a night ..... 

room is ok .... comparable to motel 6 .... one of the mattresses obviously needs to be replaced ...... the first thing we noticed was that the mattress was sunk in like an elephant sat on it for a month .... 

NO HOT WATER!!!  we're trying to get ready on a saturday morning around 9am to start our day.  FAIL!! I called housekeeping/engineering .... yes, they were aware the hot water wasn't working, and advised someone is working on it.  I asked how long it would be .... "that, I don't know"  .... again, RUDE .... at least throw in "I'm sorry, I do apologize, but we don't have that information at this time" .... after almost another hour of wasting the day away, I requested to use the shower in another tower (at least!!) so we can start our day.  thank goodness they were able to let that happen.  so, on with our late day in Vegas!

CHECKOUT .... I didn't bother accompanying my husband to check out just so I can encounter another unhappy employee, but I did notice on the bill that we were comped our room service and daily service fees, which made me consider 2 stars.

OVERALL .... you get what you pay for. like I said earlier, we didn't expect much, but I at least expected a decent experience.  no, I wouldn't come back, and I wouldn't recommend staying at this place, unless you like filthy establishments and rude employees.The man said that he heard of this place from a commercial on tv and after taking a look at the menu online we were both a bit eager to check it out for ourselves.  Upon walking in, you will notice that the place is a split bar and restaurant.  The bar looks like a bit of a dive and was partially filled and the restaurant was completely filed.  It was Saturday evening so this was very surprising but I guess it starts to makes more sense as the night continues.

The menu was what you would expect at a hole in the wall Italian restaurant in the Midwest (read:  spaghetti, fettuccine, and lasagna).  There weren't many authentic items on the menu but I'm not too fussy so I kept an open mind and ordered the Bolagnese over fettuccine and the man ordered the spaghetti and meat balls.  My food wasn't bad but it also tasted like food I could have made at home.  The side salad that came the meal however was great; the ranch dressing took it over the top.  Looking at my date's plate,  I noticed that it 1.) only came with two meatballs and 2.)looked exactly like mine except with spaghetti.  There is really no imagination in the preparation of the dishes. 

During dinner, the bartender came and talked to us about the drinks on the menu.  He also went over which drinks were of his creation.  After talking for about 10 min or so, I could now understand why the bar had more guests than the restaurant!  The bartender is awesome and super passionate about his work there!  Unfortunately however, he is leaving to go to another bar and that was his last night.

I think I would come here again but not because the food was terrific but simply because it wasn't bad.  Also, sometimes, you just someone to cook your spaghetti for you!I love Mexican food.  El Dorado has decent food, but for the price there is much better.  Their guacamole is very plain and tastes more like mashed avocados with a scoop of Pico De Gallo on top, then guacamole.  I have had the fish tacos which were par for the course, and the braised pork adobo.   Portions of the pork were juicy and delicious, while other bites were dry.  It seemed as if reheated pork was mixed with fresh pork.

The service is slow and disappointing.  The guacamole came out fast, but the chips took 5 minutes.  The server decided to add chicken to the South West Caesar salad for my vegetarian girl friend.  After we finished our salad and guacamole it took thirty minutes for our entrees to arrive and being charged for salsa at a Mexican restaurant is just odd.

They do have a good selection of tequilas.Been going here since I was a kid.  Pizza has always sucked.  Cheap and greasy with an abundance of uncooked dough to make up for the meager toppings.  Best thing going for it is the cup of sauce to dip your nearly sauce-less slice in.  Still I go every few months when I get a hankering, and then I am disappointed and sick afterwards.This is a review of my bridal appointment in 2012. Vera's has some gorgeous dresses and the building itself is very pretty but I was treated horribly here. My consultant was clearly annoyed by the fact that I had brought an entourage of 5 family members to the appointment. I was on the lower end of the price scale (under $1000), which I suspect may have been some of the reason for her demeanor with me, which was very cold & dry from the beginning. You know how those snotty Rodeo Drive shop girls treat Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman? Yeah, that was the vibe I got from my consultant.

The breaking point for me was when my mom brought in a dress she had found on the rack outside the dressing room (my family wasn't going crazy running around the store or anything) and the sales consultant actually said in a snippy voice "I won't be able to get that over her hips." Yes, I have some curves- I'm a size 10! However, there are ways to give a bride an idea of a dress if the sample won't fit her- hold it up, etc. 

I ended the appointment early and went to Brandi's Bridal, where I was treated with respect. The consultant there made it fun and didn't make me feel crappy about my body. And I ordered a dress that gorgeously showed off my curves!

I sent a complaint to Vera's and never heard back from them. "You work on commission, right? Big mistake! Huge!"Having done an adequate amount of traveling with different airlines, I would have to say US Airways is my least favorite. I just don't understand why they don't feed me? It was a six hour flight, an not even a snack? Madness. 
More regarding the airlines though, Their stewards are not as cheerful or nice as others...and they mess up everything. Forget your flight leaving on time or having your baggage when you get there. They had three chances to get it right, and struck out every time. Rebooked me on another airlines' flight that was already overbooked and then wouldn't help us get on a new flight because they had "turned us over", come on!The food here is really good and I hate having to give it a poor review, but today, my husband and I waited for well over an hour after we gave our order to get our food.  They told us that it was because of a catering order, but as customers with their rear end in seats at tables languished for over an hour -- we weren't alone, other tables full of people left without eating -- they made NO effort to even offer us anything.  I'm diabetic, so I finally asked them to get me something, but I had to ask.  No accomodation was made for the long wait.  I hope that catering business takes off, because they won't have me as a customer ever again.  The wait staff will likely have suffered from the lack of table turnover, and I left a tip for our wait person even though they were less attentive than usual.  On top of everything, my catfish was overcooked and leathery.  Hardly worth that long wait.Over priced dried out sandwiches in a cramped spot with crappy parking.   Go to Angie and Jimmys on Camelback.Again I rarely write reviews on any website but after this experience I thought a review was in order. I was in need of tires yesterday and after a call to Discount Tire, being given high prices on tire brands I had never heard of before, I went to Firestone on Osborn in Phoenix. After going over several tires available, we agreed on the Firestone Affinity Touring tire and the out the door sale price - all much less than Discount Tire for Non-Name Brand tires. The reason I am really writing this review is to warn anyone that is buying tires from a Firestone or much less any other tire shop-  LOOK AT THE SIDE WALL OF THE TIRE WHEN YOU GET THE CAR BACK TO MAKE SURE THE TIRE ON THE INVOICE THAT YOU PURCHASED IS THE SAME AS WHATS ON THE CAR.  I got home after a hot Phoenix afternoon at the Firestone and didn't look at my car till this morning when I was leaving for the day and noticed that the side wall of the tire looked different than the display and saw the words Firestone Fr710 on the sidewall - I googled and found out that the Firestone Fr710 was a much less desirable and lesser warranted tire- not the tires that I was supposed to get.  Now I called the Firestone shop and they apologized and I went back and they put the proper tires on and we will chock this up to an honest mistake that was corrected without a problem, but a warning for the future to anyone else buying tires. Match the work order to the tires on the car after the work is completed.Burgers suck and small, gyros o.k., italian beef chewy, sandwich dry even if you get it wet, and nothing special about the dogs... Chicago dogs? C'mon .. I'm from the north suburbs and never had a dog with mustard prepared on top of the relish. UHG!!!Sardella's is just ok. My biggest complaint is in the value. They charge $1.50 per topping on a large pizza and then REALLY SKIMP on them. The other day I ordered a large pepperoni, onion, mushroom , hot pepper and had it delivered. With delivery charge and a decent tip this was $25. I was shocked when I opened the box to find a total of 8 hot pepper rings on the entire pizza. The other toppings were nearly as sparse. I figure for 1.50 per topping, they could at least put 2-3 of everything on each slice of pie. Not a dismal 1. I probably wont spend my money here again.= = = = = =  WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET  = = = = = =

Ok, so here's a new Pizza Hut BUFFET.  :-)       Robyn N. & I dropped in today to give it a try for lunch.  This location is plain, more fast-food style than a restaurant, but it does have comfortable booths for dining inside.

You order & receive salad & drinks at your table, while the rest is help-yourself at the hot table.  

The salad was good, & the pizza not so much.  They put out 3 or 4 pizzas at a time for you to take slices from, & there was some cheesy pasta with white sauce, & also some pasta with red meat sauce, both of which were good.  Then, there were garlic sticks with warm Marinara sauce available, & some dessert bread sticks.

The pizza at Pizza Hut Buffet on 48th St. also isn't very good but the dining room over there is much nicer.

Between here & the 60 freeway on this street there are four other buffets...  New China is worse than this, CiCi's about equal (but $2 to $3 less & more items to choose from), while Oriental Buffet & India Oven are both better choices than this for your buffet lunch, I think.

Lunch Buffet served weekdays 11 AM to 1:30 PM.  $5.99 + $1 for salad.

8/12/2013 NOTE:  Oriental Buffet is now U-Like World Buffet & it's also better than this.     :-)Ehh, it was Okay. I didn't purchase anything. Lots to choose from but I am picky on how my fruit and veggies look. These were bottom of the barrel picks. Love how they may be locally grown but ehh, i'll pass on the flies and dirt floor.This store does not have a large selection of items. Many are decent in quality. Would not even make an offer on a 14k white gold ring with a half carat diamond and 2/3 ctw in natural untreated blue sapphires. At least they were willing to look and were not rude about it.I really don't know why this place gets so many good reviews. It is very dirty. Very old. It gets busy and the service is horribly slow. And honestly the food is just greasy and nasty.

The reviews say it's a great place for cheap good Mexican food. But it's not even cheap.

The salsa is not fresh. And the guacamole is pretty tasteless. When you order tortilla chips and salsa... They put package shredded cheese on and not melted.

I had a taco salad and I couldn't even finish eating it. 

If you like really quick and bad American Mexican food and then this is the place for you.I only went to this place because it was part of a Groupon deal and after reading reviews I thought "everyone has their own experiences I'll give this a chance." If I did not have the $7.00 for $15.00 worth I would have been EXTREMELY disappointed and felt I might as well thrown the 15.00 out the window for someone to find.


The bagels were very salty tasting and hard. The service was extremely slow at 10:00am. When asked for "no tomatoes" they were included. Overall, you might as well save your money and go to Einstein's for their breakfast bagels, or to Dunkin' Doughnuts. I would not go back there again.Food was tasty. Service was SLOW.

I have been back twice since this dinner, and my two-star review stands.  The food is no doubt good.  However the wait time is extremely lacking and will make me consider other establishment in the future.I wanted a chance to "grand slam" something. I have been accused of being "too nice" on most of my reviews - easy to explain... I don't usually bother to rate places I don't like. 

2 stars for Denny's (...I don't understand how anyone rates anything 1 star... two is the lowest for me unless I am physically hurt by eating somewhere - Look, I understand if you're angry after a bad experience, but lets keep it in perspective - A pile of shit served cold in Iraq might rate 1 star, if you weren't hungry...)

This is the most pathetic excuse for dining there is. The food is generic and bland, the atmosphere is like a k-mart, and the crowd is just plain sad to be there (minus the after 2am drunken folks who don't know any better, or seniors who have few taste buds left).

Sure I have eaten here, rather than starve... but I'm sure not proud of it! If there were anything else open at 2am I doubt anyone with taste buds would waste their time.

Save your money (an extra dollar or two) and treat yourself to one of the dozens of GREAT breakfast spots in town. Life is too short to eat crap. Better to support good restaurants with your dollars - guess what? that breeds more good restaurants! Don't settle!Rules. Rules. And more Rules! 
No cell phones.
No incomplete parties.
No credit cards. (cash only)
No firearms.
No outside drinks allowed in.
No to go orders on weekends & holidays.
No smoking. (which is a city law)
So if you can handle all of this, the food is pretty good.
oh yeah... btw.. if you would like to try the blueberry syrup then be prepared to pay $1.75 for a 2 Tbsp. serving of smashed blueberries mixed with pancake syrup... They didn't tell me it was extra and I found it quite disappointing to pay so much for so little.Very first time share experience- nice place but call before you reserve!!! No pool week we stayed & no one informed pool closed whole week we would be there!! Pool was to open yesterday & still not open! Big reason we chose Scottsdale to lay by pool & relax- will think again about coming here again- we pay good honest money & deserve good honest service!!!This is not great pizza by any stretch of the imagination but it will get the job done at 2 in the morning after a night in the club. This place gets crowded but the line moves fast. It's also a good place to try to chat up a girl if you struck out in the club.I was in Scottsdale for work and was craving something from the southwest. Carlsbad had great Yelp reviews. I was surprised as about everything in my experience was the opposite of what I'd read on yelp. The service was actually good. The bartender, I think his name was Louie, was very friendly. The food was mediocre at best; it kind of reminded me of airport Mexican food. The green chile isn't the same time of green chile I'm used to in Denver. This green chile was more like a salsa, not the stew/roux I've become familiar with in the southwest. My experience was fine, but not close to good enough to bother with Carlsbad again.More of a Tex-Mex than authentic Mexican food.  Had the chicken & shrimp enchiladas.  Rice was very dry.  Green chile sauce overpowered taste of chicken and shrimp.  Husband had the pork burrito with red sauce.  Had good flavor but was spicy.  Also ordered the green chile mashed potatoes because they sounded interesting.  Very bland.  Needed salt and pepper.  Sopa tasted like toasted bread.  Great service but overall food disappointing.The atmosphere on the patio is nice with the fountains but it isn't nice having dinner to the smell of chlorine.  The food was ok and the server had no problem honoring the yelp complimentary chips and salsa.  We each got the green chili chicken burrito.  The food was laden with cheese and not for the cholesterol conscious.  It was hard to taste much besides the cheese and the spice but, there was chicken in there too.  If it weren't for the patio/water feature, I don't think this place would be in business.This is not a sportsbar - in fact the TV sets looks like they were picked up from an garage sale back in 1980.  It is dark and dingy inside that bar, a true dive experience. My visit was brief due to the fact that they do not show sports - in fact they were watching Taxi Driver the movie - in the middle of the day. Not much of a need to return here, unless I moved within walking distance.Grounds are lovely. Pools are nice. Food was decent. Room was, like some have said: meh ! Mini bar is great, the rest of the room as oldish and sad. But the bed was fine. That's what really matters. What happened to us was weird though.... I am surprised and so I'm posting: during the evening while they were watering, I slipped  on the wet sidewalk and slammed my head. Got a concussion. I called the desk to ask about medical help and they were nice enough to call a physician which I paid for. They sent security to that night before the Doc (from outside service) arrived. So the doctor stitched up my lacerations and treated me etc. However, I have to say I was pretty surprised that the hotel never checked back with me. Never seemed interested if I made it through the night !

 The outside doctor called me twice the next day -- Just wondering about my progress. The hotel wasn't interested.  So, it's not terribly important, but it's not your warm and friendly place, that's for sure.Yeah sure they make fresh quacamole at your table, but it's not very good. Same goes for the rest of the food. I've had better food at the roadside in Rocky Point. Their margaritas are flavorless and weak. The chips are bland and dry and their salsa is very American. The food is edible, but I don't think this place can qualify as mexican.

I don't eat beans, so I can't comment on the quality of theirs - they looked disgusting though (like all beans do). I had some soft tacos - it came as 3 tiny tacos with some flavorless bits of steak and cheese inside. The plate was covered in a mountain of rice and junk. Meh. I had 3 margaritas and couldn't even draw a buzz.

I'm surprised this place stays in business. Macayo's and Z Tejas and other chains are much better and they shouldn't be. I don't eat fast food anymore, but I'd seriously rather eat Taco Bell. 

The people I ate with seemed to enjoy their meal, but they aren't very picky.Serving pho without bean sprout? What the...Welcome to an excellent case study in why a nice property in a desirable, high-traffic location would be more than half empty during dinner.  Exhibit A: Three empty-headed hostesses so busy bantering wittily with themselves that it took them over two minutes to acknowledge my existence.  Exhibit B: I ordered a glass of Pinot and it tasted like it had been opened sometime during prior year.  I mentioned to bartender who said "no, I just opened it" rather than offering a replacement.  And what a Happy Hour: $1 off -- can they spare it?  Dinner portions were excellent, but food was mediocre, other than the super croissants: warm and delicious, but nowhere near enough to make up for the rest of the experience.  With so many other superb options in Scottsdale, I can't see this place lasting another year.  Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere.I really wanted to like this place. With good experiences at other Chinese restaurants in the area (Flo's, Ling & Louie's, etc), mostly positive Yelp reviews, and a vote of confidence from a friend of mine, I was eager to try out George and Son's.  Unfortunately, the expectation didn't meet up with reality.

I called ahead and made a reservation, which seemed to be a good idea, even though we were going early on a Thursday evening.  It turned out to be a smart move, as there were several groups waiting for seats when we walked in.  We were quickly seated, given menus and water, and then left to peruse the food selections.  For twenty minutes.

Now, I don't mind being given a little extra time to look over the offerings at a new place, but when I've been able to review everything twice, pick out the different font choices, and play "find the typo" on the menu, it's been too long.  When our waitress finally came by, she spoke to us with an almost-indecipherable accent, which made it difficult for us to figure out what she was saying about the food, kitchen, or what have you.  What I was able to interpret was that if I wanted to get a (as in one) veggie spring roll as an appetizer, it would take twenty minutes.  Exactly why it would take twenty minutes, I don't know, but that did seem a little absurd.  

We ordered our entrees (citrus chicken for my friend, chicken chow mein for me) and a pot of tea.  When the tea came, the waitress gave some kind of warning, which we later determined was along the lines of, "we just put the bag in, this will have to steep for a few minutes."  After about 15 minutes of steeping, it was still very weak.

The portions on the food were generous; I definitely had enough left over to make a good-sized lunch the next day.  

When I try a new restaurant, I pick a dish that I can get at almost any restaurant of that type (eggplant parmesan at Italian places, pastrami on rye at delis, and so on), since it's usually a good litmus test for the restaurant itself.  If they can handle the basic, less adventurous fare, that   And while the chicken chow mein was decent, it reminded me of chow mein that I'd had at AA Wok on 32nd Street, where it costs less than half as much.  For the price, location, and reputation, I expected more.  Also, the brown rice I ordered on the side came with a $2 surcharge, something that I didn't see on the menu.

Overall, George and Son's was serviceable, if not remarkable food.  But the overall experience and price have all but ensured that I won't be coming back, especially with the other options available in the area.  

Also, my friend got a fortune-less fortune cookie.  I'm pretty sure that's a metaphor for this place.We visited Harlow's around 9am on a Monday morning. We were seated promptly at a booth near the bar. It was nice to see "regulars" interacting, but we probably won't become one of them. It seemed like everything was just cooked too hot. Here's what we had:

I had the pancake, egg and sausage patty combo. The eggs were supposed to be scrambled, but there was no fluffiness to them. Instead, they were closer to being fried and literally just chopped up with the spatula before plating. One small sausage patty. The pancakes tasted fine but were well cooked on one side (down, of course, as if I couldn't taste it if I couldn't see it??). $9. Ouch.

Hubby got eggs over easy, toast and hashbrowns (plus a shooter of juice--seriously, it's a tiny glass). His toast was cooked perfectly. The eggs were overdone and lacked runny yolks. He didn't complain about the hashbrowns, but even one side of those were darkened. Another $9.

We tried to share a regular order of biscuits and gravy, but it just wasn't that great. For $7 you get three split biscuits (these were decent--definitely buttermilk and the perfect balance between dense and fluffy) smothered with gravy. I think I saw 3 tiny bits of sausage, and the rest just tasted mainly of flour. We left it half uneaten.

All in all, you don't go here for the ambiance, and now I wouldn't go for the food. It's sad that as we passed a McDonald's hubby said, "I bet their bacon and egg McMuffin would've been better."They're back!  The club looks good since they've reopened.  The menu of food and drink is strikingly similar to that of Stand Up Live in Phx, but I'm pretty sure its the same owner. It is all ok, not great, but not terrible.  Prices for drinks are pretty darned high.  Be prepared to spend $30/person if you're drinking alcohol (2 drinks/person + tax and 15% automatic gratuity, no matter how many times you have to ask for something.)  Unlike SUL Phx, food items do not count towards your 2 items per person, which was disappointing. My bf does not drink, so he either spends $10 on 2 small bottled waters or $13 on a bottomless soda. A bit ridiculous. 

The club is smaller than SUL, so its a bit more intimate. Too bad their prices don't reflect that intimate small club feel.  I get a text almost every weekend that I've "won" a 4-pack of tickets to the show, so I'm guessing they're having a hard time filling seats at the same premiums as the big brother club downtown.  Btw, if you "win" these, you pay the handling charge of $5 plus tax upon picking them up. 

IMO, Tempe Improv needs to understand their audience is a college crowd and people aren't going there to empty their wallets. Play to the people who live nearby and do smaller acts, and drop your drink prices by a buck or two.The place has a nice little vibe going on and they have some unique items but the reason the rating is so low is that there really aren't a lot of options that don't involve faux meat.  Aren't these people vegan?  Don't they hate the idea of poor little animals being our food (even though that is the only reason they are alive)?  Then why so much FAKE MEAT?!  

I will never understand the meat envy vegans and vegetarians have.  I go to a place like this to get a dish that uses vegetables in more creative ways, not to get some overly processed soy products that aren't nearly as healthy as fresh lean meats like chicken and fish.  FYI, I love meat but every once in a while I like to grab a vegetarian dish.  

Another negative is nearly everything is fried.  Guess they bust the myth that people are vegan because it is healthier.  Frying things is the cheap way out of actually creating a healthy AND tasty meal.  

I'll give them a 2.5 star because what we chose was quite tasty.  But with nearly every option involving faux meat and tofu it really is a disappointment.  If you want legitimate vegan fare try out some indian places or Ethiopian places.  They are very creative and using spices to flavor a vegetable dish. The fake cheeses and meats are for Vegans with meat envy, not for Omnivores that just want a good meal.  Keep your expectations in check and you should be okay.I am a recent transplant to the Phoenix area and I can completely understand that we are not in a fashion hub such as NYC or LA but seriously. I recently graduated from a fashion design school back east and I know my fabrics however entering this place be aware you are waking into a giant mess. Yes, there are tables of fabric...in tattered pieces not even folded. While there are some bolts most of the store is composed of messy cheap fabrics. Their notions are not completely terrible but you gotta find them through the clutter. 

The kicker is, which I find at almost every fabric store, the old women that work at this place. After climbing though the rubbles of fabric, I find a corner that is labeled silks and contains some chiffons. Maybe 7 different colors/patterns. I go up to the counter and ask sweetly as possible "In the corner, are those all the silk chiffons you have?" Her response was "Oh that's just chiffon."  I explain to her it is in the silk section and I am look for more silk chiffon. She responds "Oh ok, then yes that is all we have."  Clearly she had no idea what I was talking about. I left right after.

Place is alright if you're look for some cheap fabric to make a costume or children's dress up clothes but if you're wanting anything of quality, stay away.The desserts are a little bland and are pricey given the small size.  I've had better Japanese bakery items elsewhere.After going to a Rally's regularly when I lived in Indiana, I was excited to see one of these in Tempe. However, my excitement was tempered over several visits.

First of all, if you're not familiar with Rally's, it is drive-up and walk-up only, with no inside dining. If you are not sitting at one of the few patio tables with umbrellas, you're gonna get it to go.

The fries can be some of the best around. However, they can also be less than desirable, who knows what changes their quality from visit to visit. The burgers can range from really good to almost crappy. Once again, I haven't figured out why they change so much. Service is consistent, though. Consistently slow.

I'm not saying stay away...but if you go, expect slower service than many fast food places, and inconsistent food quality.As a result of my past life as a consultant, I've stayed at a lot of starwood hotels - pretty much all of their brands, in a lot of cities. 

I can say that this Sheraton is one of the most disappointing starwood hotels I've stayed at. 

It has been poorly maintained - the carpets in the hallways are browning and visibly stained, the furniture in the rooms is beat up, and the decor in the rooms looks like its decades old. 

Sometimes it was difficult getting hot water in the showers. 

The Starwood Preferred club lounge is better maintained and offers continental breakfast and light evening fare for elite members, but you have to pay for any drinks. Given that several nearby hotels in the Phoenix area offer more for breakfast and evening fare, and offer free drinks, and do it for all hotel guest (not just the elite members), it's hard to give the sheraton a lot of brownie points here.

The one thing that saved this place from a dreaded 1-star review is the fact that the service was generally very good - at the front desk, in the lounge, and at the restaurant - service was always great. 

Ultimately, however, there are a ton of competing hotels in the area, most with better amenities, MUCH better rooms, service that is just as good, and they are cheaper. It's hard to justify staying here, unless of course you are doing it for the starwood points.Very average food and horrible service. Waitress gave us attitude for not understanding her accent and never even bothered to check on us once during meal.Food was ok.  Their menu prices online are not their current prices.  Also, watch out for delivery fee they charge without telling you, we paid $7 on top of our bill, thats more than what 1 entree cost!  Hot and sour soup was watery and tasted like it came out of a can.  The crab puffs were good, but didn't have any crab in them.No sign of the awesome manager that was working before.  Now two weeks in a row the same drive through lady has screwed up my order.Sushi Yuki.. Sounds like cartoon character's name.. So i gave it a try..
well.. it didn't meet my expectation.. i ordered my usual sushi.. salmon.. also known as sake..  it had lemon on top.. i asked the server why there is a slice of  lemon .. and server said.. "that's how our customer like it"..  it was clear to me that their fish was not fresh enough to be served without the lemon..

I still gave a shot.. took one bite.. and "check please"..  
maybe i am spoiled with quality sushi from other places.. or maybe i am picky??  nah.. 

sorry i had to give low rating!! maybe next time they can serve without the lemon and rotate their fish more often!Picked up a friend at the airport.  The signs were confusing and downright contradictory in some cases, and we got routed to the international terminal instead of the domestic one.  Im sure my experience on the inside of the airport will be better next time, but they need to fix the signs so Im not driving around like a idiot.  Also, Im an idiot.I had a non smoking floor yet we can smell the smoke in our room. Our clothes smell like it our hair. Shower was dirty. They didn't turn our phone on so I had to use my cell phone to call the front desk. I will not stay there again. I do like that it was across the street from a Thai place and a nice bar/lounge.My wife and I just finished lunch here and let me tell you, man-oh-man, we were disappointed.

We have eaten numerous times at the Carson Street Cafe (all the way back to when Steve Wynn still owned the place), and we have always enjoyed ourselves.  But today, it was just bad, and I give it 2 stars since I have experienced better at this cafe.

The service was really slow, the waiter didn't seem to give a rat's arse about us or the food or service and our food was just plain yucky.

I had the most bland and tasteless Cobb salad I have ever had and my wife had the Oxtail Stew.  She enjoyed her food more than I liked mine.

But our major complaint was about the service.  This place in the past always gave us good to excellent service, but today was a really different story.

I am concerned that now that this is a Landry's that it's going to be just another high priced "Denny's" kind of joint.  If so, that would be sad.  It used to be distinct and decent.

It's a sad day for me to have experienced this let down, since I have always liked the Golden Nugget.  Sad!This buffet is decently priced and has decent food. Nothing spectacular nothing horrid several stations Asian Mexican bbq salad bar Italian your typical Vegas buffet. I honedtly enjoyed the cicis pizza buffet more because I got to order my own pizza varieties.We decided to have subway for dinner...we were in the area and felt that this subway was the better of locations and choices. As we quickly realized was the exact opposite...here is my review...in the pictures is two I have uploaded showing my concern...

The first thing I noticed was a gentleman spraying down the walk way infront of the store...I won't express the lack of education this is during busy..hot hours. If u look closely at the pictures u will notice he has no yellow wet floor signs out...very dumb..so he is spraying the water and it hits my car...FAIL! Now I usually wouldn't bark about this but my sister in law is pregnant and all we need is for her to fall due to this. Once was walked into the restaurant, the dang water hose was laying in the ground were customers could easily step on it and trip...this is also pictured. Now ur saying well where should it go it's a hose...no one as there warning us of the hose or a hazard sign wasn't up...very serious...if someone trips and falls and the restaurant knows of the failure...my yelp is about lack of proper hazard awareness!My MAIN complaint about the Rio is the housekeeping service but did have some other issues.

YELP could NOT be accessed from my room and was blocked. The man at desk didn't know why Yelp didn't work from my room.

The drinking glasses had thick brownish goo around the rim and we marched them down to the desk to show the front desk and he gasped and then offered us free Internet to make us happy. (this was the first day and we thought about leaving)

The Bath tub was slippery and greasy with a slow drain.

Received an almost empty shampoo one day instead of a full one.

Received a crumbled towel on the corner with a big whole in it.

Another day had no maid service and called the front desk for towels THAT NEVER CAME!

The sofa in the room was all sunk in the middle.I was really excited about coming this restaurant, but was quickly let down before I even arrived at the place.  My reservation was at 6:45pm, the hostess called me at 6:30 saying they were giving up my table because I was not there!  I was right down the street and had to yell saying that I'd be there in less than 5 minutes.  She was not friendly when I arrived.

The restaurant was extremely crowded!  I had the first table, right next to the buffet line.  It was so crowded people were crowding my table and leaning on the back of my chair!  They were constantly watching me eat.  The service did not provide enough plates and cutlery for everyone in the place to eat.  I had to wait 10 minutes for a plate every time I stood up.

Other than the atmosphere, the food was alright.  Not much variety, but I was satisfied by what they had.  The ramen was the best part of the buffet.  On a more positive note, I absolutely loved the dessert bar!  It would please anyone with a sweet tooth.I've been in this place a time or three, and I was initially entranced by the amount of religious candles, pinatas, and quinceanera preparation stuff.  Literally, it feels like you cross the border and are in Mexico proper when you enter the store.  For a white guy like myself, it's fascinating, if not a little disconcerting.  Oh, how I prayed for an aisle of lucha libre masks. 

The time I broke down and had to pick up something from the store, which in shortening the description, was a "cluster".  I don't know what happened, but it had the full Mexican grocery store packed to capacity vibe I had experienced in Tijuana shops.  I've never had to fight so hard to move around.

I had to buy some cough drops, and asked one of the floor staff.  He turned to me and smiled, letting me know that he had no idea what I was saying.  But he took me to the front, so I could talk to a cashier.

He said something to her in Spanish, and she looked at me.  Apparently, English wasn't her first language, either.

Bear in mind that when I talk to someone who doesn't primarily speak English, I'm not one of those jerks who speaks to someone slowly like a small child, or a mental case.  Nor do I need to needlessly raise my voice, because obviously, speaking loudly is a sure way to get someone to understand you when they wouldn't otherwise before.  I kept it simple, clear, and to the point.

"Hi.  I'm looking for cough drops?"

Silence.  Her smile forms.

"Cough drops?"

"Cock drops", she responded a little too innocently.

....

Okay, what place serves "cock drops"?  Really.  And whatever does, I don't want to know.  We all stood looking at each other, confusedly, before I tried again.

"Cough drops.  Medicine."

"Maybe in there," she points at this locked cabinet, which had 1,000 different medicine types that I've never heard of before.  And no cough drops.  You're right there within better visual range than I am.  Can't you tell?

I had to pick up another thing or two.  I couldn't get help because no one seemed to understand English.  I understand it's a Mexican market, so I'm walking into non-gringo territory, but if I can learn a few basic phrases in Spanish, at least have employees who can understand some basic English for when that random white dude walks in.

Bottom line, if you want to get some authentic Mexican foodstuffs, this is the place.  Prices are average to a little overpriced, but they are stocked with some unique food choices bound to make you a hit at the next barbecue.  But go on a quieter day or I guess bring a translator if you're non-Hispanic and can't find things on your own.for reals, don't do it.  You can find cheap tables here but I wouldn't stay at the hotel unless you got a super good deal and you don't mind a lot of noise.FAQ

Q: Don't the clowns/masquerade-ball-type statues freak you out?
A: Try being on the tail-end of a three day bender and wandering up the strip and looking up to see this abomination. That will freak you out.

Q: Do they still have Triple Shot?
A: You mean that crazy 3-in-1 game? I sure hope so. War, Blackjack, and then 5-card stud? What a brilliant game for all of us who have ADD. Always bet the Hat Trick.

Q: What else is great about this place?
A: I suppose it's in a prime location, otherwise, I have been way too frightened to go beyond the first row or two of tables and slots.

FYI ... That Triple Shot game is a tourist trap and a scam. Don't play it and certainly don't continue to play it thinking you'll get your money back. In fact, why would even think like that? What a mistake. What a hassle. Unless you're semi-pro/pro at non-scam games.If it wasn't for the free offers I wouldn't stay here! Sometimes Rio is just too far from all the action so we stay here. Why? Oh, Why?

The rooms are small and the walls are sooooooo thin. You hear everything. Everytime someone goes to the bathroom or shower.......you hear it. I apologize to those I have woken up in the middle of the night when I had to go to the bathroom......

Ok, the casino is not that great. It can get packed and that Carnival thing outside is LOUD! It's cool during the day, but not when you trying to sleep and you can still hear them jamming.

A plus is the location! I'll come back when I don't know better!

*I stayed here once with my brother and sister and they tried to give us a handicap room. WTF! Does it look like we handicap! I know to us our brother is slow, but Come on! You can't judge him, you don't even know him. We went down to tell them and they switched our rooms.*

Also, my skin itches every time I stay here! I don't know if it's the starch or ............I don't even want to think about it.If there were 1/2 star options I would rate it a 2.5.  The gaming was great as in the craps dealers and the pit bosses were really awesome and the steak house ROCKED.  

But...and it's a big one - the room sucked.  Nevermind we were even with the roof so someone could have been peeping tomming all day long but come on Harrah's break open that purse where YOUZ making all that green and fix the bathtub so it "don't" drip drip drip all day and night long.  Make sure the place doesn't smell like a mildew laden sock drawer and WAIT for it...please please please be sure there aren't someone else's hairs all over the pillow.

We tried to change rooms - got all the way to someone on the phone then when I went to pick up the key the wait was 35 people long - I'm not kidding.  I actually counted the people.

So I gave up and we sucked it up - it was sad because like I said we loved the casino people...Al, you rock!!!


OH, AND IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY THE POOL - IT SUCKS.  THE WATER IS MURKY AND WAY WAY WAY WAY TOO WARM AND LOUD (MUSIC). 

SUCKED.I was SOOOO... disappointed with my experience at Spago, Las Vegas.  The Hubs and I were in town for a wedding and planned a nice date night on Saturday night.  I've been wanting to try Spago for awhile, as we've been to a couple of Wolfgang's other restaurants.  After all the hype this restaurant seemed to have, I really had high hopes for a fabulous meal... unfortunately, this was not the experience we had.

First off, the service was awful.  We ALMOST got up and left because it took 15 minutes for our waiter to greet us and ask for our drink order.  By that time it was close to 9PM and we were starving.  Once we finally ordered, we waited a really long time to get our food.  I'm not sure if it was just what we selected, but I really wasn't happy with my meal.  We had the lamb pizza and the fettuccine.  The pasta was OK, nothing to write home about and the pizza was awful in my opinion.  The crust tasted funny as did the sauce.  I really was disappointed.  Based on our disappointing meal, we opted to skip dessert.

Really, the best part of the meal was the bread basket.  Everything in that was fab.  Oh well... better luck next time Vegas.ok so first of all, coming to the venetian i was super excited to try this gelato stand as it was my first time ever trying it! but seriously 5.50 for ONE scoop? and 7.50 for TWO? can you spell RIP OFF?

yes i am aware it's vegas and things are intended to be overpriced BUT the thing that really got me going was the employees behind the counter, talk about rude.

i helped my mom ask the lady for two scoops of their fruit sorbet, pineapple and cantaloupe, but instead of putting two scoops into the same cup which was suppose to be 7.50, she put one scoop into TWO different cups and said that it was going to be rung up as 5.50 EACH. Then the lady said the only way it was going to be put on top of each other was if my mom got the cone for $1 more! WTF right?

Ok finally, the taste of the fruit sorbet and gelato, i got the tiramisu, my boyfriend the hazelnut, my sister mint chocolate and my mom pineapple and cantaloupe. Honestly, i think i'm better off getting myself a cup of frozen yogurt at yogurtland for half the price. I don't think i will ever be buying myself anymore gelato in the future from this place ever again, enough said.Food was pretty mediocre and the service was pretty terrible. There are some big freaking tvs, but other than that it's pretty underwhelming.i think i'll cry if i have to stay here again. 

my fam stays here for because its like $60 a night, but its that much for a reason - it sucks! its def one of the old casinos now w/ its fellow senior citizen, the Riviera, across the street. The location of the hotel is very far from the parts of the strip that you actually want to visit. and the food: GOD! why did i eat here?! i settled for their buffet because i had post flight hunger, but if i had known, i would've settled for McDonalds upstairs. And i wouldnt exactly call this place family friendly w/ all the $$$ theyre robbing from kids at the Midway.

So, if you have a car (to drive to the better parts of LV) and all you want is a room to bunk, this could be a good place for you. But if you like walking/dining in your own hotel, choose elsewhere. 

i think i'll study harder in school so i don't have to stay here when i grow up.Ok call me a picky bitch but because I was born and raised in Los Angeles, I am very discriminating when it comes to Mexican food. I know Mexican food damn it. My son is half Mexican. I have (ex) Mexican in-laws. I watch Mexican soccer and yell "goooooolazo golazo! azo! azo! azo!" too. So I know what's up. This place is the type of place you take people who are too scurrred to try REAL Mexican food ("is that a tongue on your plate?!").  This place doesn't even serve tripa, lengua, cabeza...you won't find Mexicans up in here! That's not authentic to me. Authentic to me is a place that serves the aforementioned body parts (yum) and bottomless horchata...when I came this place didn't even have horchata. WTF.First I want to say I didn't come here by choice. It was my boyfriends fathers birthday so he chose where to eat. I haven't personally been to Hamada in forever but it was exactly how I recalled it. Big, slow, decent food, expensive. 

Atmosphere: 4/5  You walk in this place and you feel like your in Japan. I liked the decor a lot of fake plants with a Japanese sand box in the middle (it was actually a rock box but I figured food + kids = dust everywhere). The lighting was very dark it helped disguised the fact they barely had anyone there. I was there about 6:30 prime dinner hours and that place was EMPTY.

Sashimi: 3/5 was delicious... fresh big chunks. They better be for the price! For an assorted boat of sashimi was $40 bucks. I basically inhaled it

Nigiri: 3/5 Great portions big fish and good amount of rice. I really liked their rice with the nigiri. It was a bit sweeter than most places.

Shrimp Tempura Boat: I'm not a fried food type of person but my boyfriends little brother loves Shrimp tempura. I can't give you a good opinion on shrimp tempura because I'm already bias on the friend part. 

Teriyaki Chicken Entree: 0/5 I was so surprised how SIMPLE and HORRIBLE this dish was. I literally could've gotten better Teriyaki chicken from PANDA EXPRESS. The presentation was even horrible. A scoop of rice, teriyaki chicken, and edamame 

Seaweed Salad: 0/5 What a rip off, this seaweed salad was mostly cucumber salad. They should call is cucumber salad with a dash of seaweed. What a joke.. 

Service: 5/5 Service was great, your waitresses are really nice and they get into character so well. Dressed in Japanese kimonos 

Price: 0/5 Super expensive $$$$ for 3 1/2 people our bill came close to $300...and I was still hungry after.Came across this place when I visited Las Vegas just before Christmas and wanted to find a place to have Indian food. Ordered a Chicken Biryani carryout order since dinner buffet was almost on the verge of completion.
Let me explain here - I am a food lover and can instantly say by the look of Indian restaurants on what kind of food to expect. There are different versions of "authentic" indian cuisines floating around and I must say this is not one of them.
Biryani was sweet (authentic biryani is NEVER sweet) with cashew and raisins.

Good luck with this place.They have one of these stores in NYC that is vastly cooler (both in temp and it atmosphere.)  Honestly, no matter how big an M+M fan you are, in a city where Vosges, Payard, Jean Philippe, Ethyl's, and about 100 other shoppes are within 1/4 mile......why bother?  If I want M&Ms I'll go to the gas station.I recently placed an order with M&Ms World. I purchased their personalized m&m's as a valentines day gift for my wife. Sounded like a neat idea... Something different... They allow you 4 different personalized m&m's in the order. I uploaded 2 photographs, and 2 personal messages. With shipping - $74.00. A lot of money, yes! But it's a special occasion, so whatever... My order was approved and I received a confirmation email.

The following day, I received an email from M&M informing me that one of my photos was declined because they only accept head shots that are facing the camera. I had selected a photo of me kissing my bride on our wedding day. So naturally,  I submitted another photo. We soon overcame this minor obstacle and once again,  my order was approved.

The following day I received another email. This email informed me that my order was declined again, because my message was obscene and offensive. My terribly offensive M&M message read, "Eat Me Jessica". I was a little surprised that M&M's would find this offensive. After all, it is a piece of candy, and quite literally is created with the intention of being eaten. But I'm an understanding kind of guy... so I submitted a new message, which read "Consume Me Jess". 

The following day I receive another email. Once again my order was declined because the message, "Consume Me Jess" could potentially be interpreted and used in a negative manner. I suppose I could have complied with their silly rules and created another message, but instead I canceled the order and bought her some Hershey Kissables. Saved myself about $70.00!!!!

If you have a lot of patience, this might be a really cool idea. It is very pricey, and for the money you spend, there are a lot of restrictions. I would give their customer service 1 star. They only responded through emails and never called my phone to discuss the order.  The store sounds cool though, but I've never visited in person.I go to Casino Royale for craps.  $5 minimum with 100x odds.  I don't bet anywhere near 100x odds, but I have seen people put down 100x.  Central location on the Strip is very convenient.  Otherwise, its very dingy and full of chain smokers.My other half, the garbage disposal, just had to have some great BBQ while in Vegas. Somehow, I just knew it wasn't gonna happen at HD on the strip. And I'm Vegan ... yeah, this wasn't pretty. My boyfriend said his BBQ sandwich was average. I was stuck ordering my third veggie burger and fries for the third day in a row. The waitress was really great about my dietary restrictions I thought at the time (now, I feel really unhappy after reading another Vegan review below - her waitress said the veggie burger did have dairy). The waitress told me the cook said the veggie burger had no dairy in it. They put the veggie burger on wheat bread. However, the veggie burger looked and tasted like no veggie burger I've ever seen or eaten. It was a thin pattie that looked and tasted exactly like a McDonald's or Burger King pattie - it's been three years since I ate meat, but I haven't forgotten the taste. I honestly believe this was a meat pattie because that's what it looked and tasted like. And if it was, that is so not right. After two bites, I was afraid to eat anymore for fear if it really was meat I would be physically ill. The waitress was accomodating and took it off the bill. Oh well, the fries were good. However, if this restaurant is going to offer vegetarian options, they really need to get knowledgable about those options.The only reason to go to this place is if you get in for free - which apparently is not that uncommon. 

I was with a party of 7 when we were stopped going into NY, NY and asked if we wanted free passes to CU. Sure, why not? I'd been before when it was super packed after it first opened, and didn't hate it. I knew the gimmick was free shots for the ladies (of the super-sweet, hardly any alcohol variety!), and I knew the whole cowgirl dance that happened on the bar frequently too. 

Anyway, we all got in...to find a near empty club. The hilarity started ensuing when us girls lined up for free shots, and our drunk male companion sauntered up there to get one as well. The sassy bartendress in her ripped jeans so that her "VS PINK" panties could show (like, ALL of them) gave him a whatfor, made him get on his knees, wag his tail, and bark like a dog. Bless his drunk heart, he did. 

All that was fun, until she threatened to cut off his tie. Being an expensive silk number, his girlfriend saved it just in time. When sassy chick found out we had a bride in our party, she pulled her up and FELT her up whilst pouring shots into her mouth. Which...was less sexy, and more icky. 

Fortunately, we only stayed  long enough for 3 rounds of shots, missed the dancing on the bar entirely - and even more fortunately, we weren't asked to take off our bras...

I could see this being a draw for the younger crowd, particularly for free, and with more people inside. But I don't think I'll give it a third chance.For a NY Steak that cost $43 it had a surprising amount of gristle and fat on it, far too much for a steak of that price.   In fact I had to cut away half of what I was served just to get to the actual meat.   I was really unimpressed, a good cut of steak at an expensive restaurant should not be mostly gristle and fat!   Additionally I was less than impressed that the steaks did not include any sort of side whatsoever, and you have to pay extra for a side of potatoes.  The service was pretty good however, which is what is keeping me from giving this a rating of one.I came here last year with my boyfriend's family for a nice dinner. It has a old school Las Vegas feel off the strip. I remember getting the seafood platter which was pretty good. It had an assortment of shrimp, stone crab and oysters. I had some of the prime ribeye with potatoes au gratin. The sauteed mushrooms were good too. It was a pretty good steakhouse but I think I have had better. They have a bucket full of golf tees in front with their logo so you can take one home.I've eaten here twice. The first time was for the lunch buffet and this was before they remodeled. The food was delicious.

So I went again during dinner. WHAT. A. MESS.

For a place nestled in a shadier neighborhood, I didn't think reservations would be necessary. When we came in, we were seated at a table that still had remnants and water glasses from the last diners. We kept trying to flag a server down, but no one would even look our way. 

I'm very patient, but not 20 minutes of no service patient. I usually give places/servers the benefit of the doubt, but it was absolutely ridiculous even after we flagged someone and they said someone would be right with us. I've never walked out of a restaurant due to bad service or even bad food, but one can only wait so long.

If my memory wasn't tarnished by that experience, I'd try the place again. Otherwise, this place needs to be aware of their diners. I won't be going back again.Huge fan of Todai, so I dragged my woman to this one while we were in Sin City.

Big Mistake...

Sushi sub par, atmosphere depressing, and hot food bleh.

Compared to the Todais in California this is the Red headed step sister with freckles.

Sorry Todai of Las Vegas but Fail.

Please send a rep to Todai of Westminster and Steal that Mgr and bring her to this one. A la Patrick Swayze in "Roadhouse."Not worth the money- better value at Sprouts even though Whole Foods is a bigger store.  I used to love the take-out section but it seems to have less variety and nothing that really stood  out.This recent trip was the first time I've been to a jack in the box in 10 years and the first time I've ever gone sober.  

I got off of work and was very hungry, realized I had no food at home, and made the impulse decision to stop in here.  There was no line so I ordered quickly.  My food was ready in a few minutes.  

First, these sandwiches look absolutely nothing like the pictures.  Smaller, grayer, and totally unappealing to the eye.  The taste was blah but whatever I just wanted some food in my belly.  

Second, the place was full of crazy people.  They were being loud and obnoxious and generally behaving like crazy people do.  I should have gotten drive-thru but ate inside because i was hungry.  

I plan on not going back for another ten years, or at least not when I'm sober.We eventually got our food, it was delicious. The waitress didn't charge for our drinks, and did apologize again. The host told us about additional military specials they do. Overall, we are still abundantly disappointed; if only because she didn't come out right away to tell us she had lost her sheet and didn't have our order.I hate to leave bad reviews but after my experience at Canyon Falls, I feel the need to. I was beyond excited to have my hair colored and new extensions put in. Almost 1000 dollars later, I left the salon satisfied. I washed my hair and the color seemed orange. I decided to call, and they fixed it no problem. Great. But now, there was another issue. Since the second day I left the salon I had been loosing beads from my extensions and within a month the hair was tangled and felt old. I know it's not normal and finally I had enough. I was told to go and talk to Mary, who was extremely rude to me told me it was my fault, and to either buy new hair or there's nothing she can do. I demanded to see a manager who once again pointed fingers at me, but eventually agreed for 40$ they could deep condition and put my extensions back in with another stylist.

To make a long story short, my extensions are fine now, still a little tangly. But it's funny how it was my fault, even though now I'm not loosing any beads. I've never had this many issues at a hair salon and doubt I'll go back. At least they were willing to fix the problem but I feel like the customer service and issues were to much to overlook.I came here for brunch with my mother and grandmother the other day and the food was subpar at best. I got the chef salad with honey mustard dressing and it had a weird bitter aftertaste. I honestly thought they gave me dijon mustard instead of honey mustard. It ended up being the actual salad itself. 
My mother got the cuban panini and the pulled pork on the sandwich not only tasted weird, it had a weird/bad smell to it as well. The only person who got a decent meal was my grandmother who got the basic bacon and eggs breakfast. 

In all honesty, I probably wouldn't come back here because it was so off. 

The server, however, was quite nice. I can't seem to recall her name but she was very friendly and we never went with an empty cup. Always a plus :)I am old school and grew up with my Mom back in the 80's when I was a kid we would frequent Merle Norman often for all of her beauty goodies. They have great quality products for face cleansing. As with any other brand the prices have increased over the last 20 years however not so much that it will keep me from buying their products.

I miss the old days with my Mom when she would stop by and pick up makeup. They really treated you like a Queen then and really were hands on with demonstrating and selling the products.

These days you walk in and pick up what you want and are on your way. The staff does not have the passion, knowledge or motivation to show me new products or demonstrate.

I know what I want when I go in as I have been using the same products for years however show me something new rather than point to a display and say that is what is new.

My last experience was poor, the employee had no clue about their makeup accessories such as a foundation brush. "She thinks this is the one I want or should have". Don't give me that, when I know more about the products then an employee does it does not make me feel like spending my money and shopping! The employees name is on my receipt however I will keep it to myself rather than name drop.

I am disappointed, I don't expect the Outstanding quality of service that was issued back in the 80's however at least fake it til you make it and help a customer.

If this type of service continues, then I see in the future Merle Norman being another statistic of going out of business and closing shop all together. 

There are way too many beauty brands and concepts out there to provide service that lacks luster!Six weeks ago, I attempted to order a washer and dryer set for my house. The entire event couldn't be scripted to be any more ridiculous if I tried...

- Purchased an awesome LG Washer/Dryer ("W/D") set online and then tried to do a price match at the store when I discovered a competitor had the same set available for much less. The net result of BB trying to price match the set landed me with a total of six (6) W/Ds being charged to my account, without my knowledge.

- I discovered the error when BB texted me on the morning of my delivery to state that my account had been locked and they wouldn't be delivering my appliances until I resolved the account issue. This was at 7:01am; none of the BB services open for telephone assistance until after 10:00am. Delivery was supposed to take place at 9:00am. Couldn't reach anyone by phone to resolve.

- I had to spend several hours at the store trying to get the first (wrong) order corrected and the six sets of W/Ds returned. That took quite honestly over 2 hours and several people to resolve. Manager of store vowed they would "make things right."

- Eventually got W/D scheduled for delivery, but when they arrived, they were too big to fit through narrow basement door/stairwell. Delivery drivers measured space and told me exact model to order as they guaranteed it would fit. This alternate set wasn't my first choice, but they assured me it would fit.

- Went through another round of telephone-tag/frustration trying to return the original set that was too large to fit. It took a solid week to finalize the return.

- Second set was ordered and delivered by BB to the house. Drivers couldn't fit them into the basement, despite their assurance these would fit. 

- They did manage to knock several large holes into my plaster/lathe walls, and beat the heck out of the machines in the process. BB driver said stairs were too narrow and that I needed to widen my stairway.

+ I re-engineered my stairway and made it a full 4" wider... This wasn't an easy feat... I had to re-sister joists, cut subflooring, shave/thin a wall, widen the steps and adjust the stair runners accordingly. It took a full day and $200+ in supplies.

- Third set was ordered (exact same model as second set) and scheduled for delivery on 6/26/14. I never received a call to confirm my delivery time as I had in the past. When I called to inquire about the status, I was told that my delivery date was listed as 7/1/14, not 6/26/14.

- I brought in the receipt that showed 6/26 as delivery. Store insisted I was wrong and that 7/1/14 was correct. Manager eventually discovered an unexplained computer glitch that had phantom-shifted my delivery date without notifying anyone. 

- Third set was delivered on 7/1/14. BB drivers STILL COULDN'T FIT THE W/D SET INTO THE BASEMENT. Said it was "impossible" and "a waste of their time."

+ My friend came over after BB Delivery left and we had the set in the basement within 10 minutes, without damaging anything. UGH. It's laughable how easy it was for us to get the set into the basement without issue.

- It is IMPOSSIBLE to reach anyone at the store via telephone. The main desk folks (especially "Natalie") who answer are as unhelpful as people come, and seem to enjoy being snotty. 

- The appliances manager repeatedly asked me to give him a call if I had any problems/questions, which I quite often did (as seen here), but each time I'd call to ask for him, he was *always* unavailable. I'd ask, "Is Mike available?" Natalie: "No." Me: "When might he be in?" Natalie: "Don't know." Me: "Can I leave a message for him?" Natalie: "No." 

Seriously. 

Best Buy did provide me with some pricing credits, but based on the colossal headache and cluster-F that this ordeal was, I won't ever purchase something from them that requires them to deliver it. 

Talk about a very bad taste in your mouth... I'd rather lick a 9V battery than deal with this again.I've been talking about this search for the perfect reuben for so long that people are starting to wonder. I figured that I'd better start documenting this search lest people begin to question my dedication to the task at hand.

I hadn't been to Ella's since I relocated to Madison 7yrs. ago. So I figured that this Madison Institution would be a good place to start. So, the sandwich was pretty decent. The corned beef was delicious and not too greasy. I don't know why they don't serve it on a dark rye, like most every other place I've had one (we'll forget the sourdough I had once in the north woods). Loss of points here. My only other gripe would be that they could have spared some fries and made a bigger sandwich.

The reason for the two star rating is the service I received. I was one of maybe four customers in the whole place (everyone else was already seated and eating when I arrived), and it still took ten minutes for a staffer to bring a cup of water. The server's demeanor was short and far from sweet.

So, bring the kids to Ella's. That's the demographic they're going for. It's like Chuck-E-Cheese for the pre-teen steampunk crowd. If you're looking for a decent reuben in Madison, get it to go.The salad and pizza were very good, but NOT worth a 3 hour wait. Really. Heard good things, tried it once, won't be back.i can see why this place is popular. it's definitely hip and in a cool location. their coffee and their service have only been mediocre in my experiences, however. bitter shots and huge bubbles in the milk. even though the place is well known, you can probably find better quality and less of a pretentious atmosphere elsewhere.Disclaimer, this place is fine for what it is designed for - a super trendy place for extremely hip people to chill, socialize and be fabulous.  The music was decent but too loud for me.  Walking in there gave me anxiety because I had no idea where to order, what to order and once I was given the menu I felt extremely rushed.  The drink was just OK, I wish I would have had more of a chance to look at the menu but I just felt like I was in the way.  Once I found a seat I was so uncomfortable I ended up leaving to a different, quieter coffee shop.  I appreciate what the place is and should I have a friend come into town and we just want to go in to grab a drink and chat I may go back but at this time all I need is decent chair, an electric outlet and some good coffee and I'll be good to go.After months of avoiding Los Dos Molinos in favor of places with better service and margaritas, we decided to return last Saturday night and give the place another chance. We were actually even less impressed with the experience than last time. 

My blue corn enchiladas were still quite good, but my husband's chimichanga was just average. I guarantee you that you can get a better chimichanga for half the price at many of the other great Mexican restaurants in South Phoenix. The accompanying rice was also really dry; I think the rice at Poncho's is a lot better. 

I also gave the tequila-flavored limeade--I mean, margaritas--another chance, but was still completely disgusted by them. The most amusing part is that after I told the server that I found them to be too limey and sweet last time, he admitted that they mix the margaritas up in advance and that if the server doesn't properly "stir" the mix, they can be "too sweet." He then promised me that it would be "better this time." I guess I'm a sucker for ordering one anyway (I guess I had this morbid desire to see if it was really going to be as bad as last time), but shame on Los Dos Molinos for approaching margarita-making like they're serving drinks at a college party. 

Finally, the service is totally pretentious for no reason. I understand that this restaurant is very popular, but I don't feel that the owners take much pride in putting out consistently good-quality food and drinks or in being a place where people feel comfortable and want to linger with friends. 

Los Dos Molinos must always be so busy because people are lured by the exotic spiciness (and maybe falsely equate spiciness with authenticity), but I have a feeling that discerning restaurant-goers who notice (and care about) the details might not be in love with the place.Rolled on over to Body English for after hours after starting my night at Lavo.  I sorta/kinda remember getting to the Hard Rock...not much of a line around 2:30ish but we were on a guest list and no problems getting in.  Stopped at the bar upstairs to buy my ladies a round of drinks...$50 for 4 drinks...not surprised, and actually not too bad.  I once paid $22 for a redbull/vodka in Vegas. *&^*$(**&%#*!!?!??!!

Once again, a million and one stairs to get downstairs. This is the worst idea ever when ladies in heels are involved.

The dance floor was small, not crowded, but fun.  You knew that the people here were all pretty much wasted, but ready to keep the party going.  (I usually end up at Drai's for my afterhours, but since it's temporarily closed...)  The DJ was...eh.  Trust me, I love my EDM, and will be back for EDC in Vegas, but this was straight too much techno for me.  The untse untse's never changed.  It gets too repetitive for me.

So I wandered over to the downstairs bar for another drink, and my experience here is what really left a bad taste in my mouth.  Facing the bar I was on the far left side.  The female waitress straight ignored me for a good 5-7 minutes, serving all of the men around me.  I am a patient bar fly, waiting my turn and not hounding the bartenders.  But when my whole side of the bar was empty, and she decided to hug and chat with her male friend that stopped by, even looking at my and obviously deciding she didn't want to serve me,  I had had enough.  Marched right on down to the other female bartender who was hustling to serve folks, and had a drink within a minute.  I told her she was doing an excellent job and that her coworker was a lazy, rude b*tch, and she just shook her head in silent agreement.  I would rather brave the stairs and go back to the upstairs bar than give that stupid a$$ my money.  At the end I hoped she would serve me so that I could give her a big fat ZERO tip.

Body English...get your bartenders in check.  I have never been treated so rudely in Vegas.  Will I be back? Not unless I'm dragged.

Bonus: after hours.
Bogus: rudest bartender ever.The good stuff.  Good basic burgers (skip the high end stuff), good beer list, and a good menu of ingredients and sides.  The bad stuff, most things overpriced, and the service.

Sorry Todd (the server), I know we were a big table (10), but that food took forever, one order was completely forgotten, and one burger was medium well instead of medium rare.  And while my wife got the $16 buffalo burger you raved about, I got the $9 Angus and mine was better.  The fatty cow is always tastier than the lean healthy buffalo in my experience, and at double the price for lean and healthy, I am not willing to give up flava.  Fooled me once and got me to buy your pricey burger while you had an automatic 18% tip for a big group, but it won't happen again, and hopefully all the Yelpers will be on to you now.

Oh yeah, Karen got the $12 foie gras option and it was nothing to write home about. Cool that it is on the menu, but I would like it to pay it's own way too.  While I don't mind spending $88 for burgers at lunch while in Vegas, it better be over the top spectacular at that price, and this simply wasn't.  

Other notes: The zucchini fries were pretty good, though a bit mushier than I would have preferred.  And this would be a 3 star place if we had just gone in, got the Angus burgers at $9+options, had our food prepared right, and got our food in less than 50 minutes, which is kind of ridiculous for a burger.  Oh yeah, also cool that this place has about 4 different fresh bun options, 3 different bacons, and about 20 or so other interesting sides.  Jsut skip the foie gras and probably the lobster, though no one in our group tried the lobster so Ic an't speak first hand for it.OK this is overrated!!!
Bobby Flay has more fame than culinary abilities! 
Nothing we tried was memorable.  
Service was friendly yet nothing to remember.
The decor is fun and location is great.
For the money spent I think there are many much better places to go in Vegas than here.  Do not think I will be back.
Good luck Bobby!Before you read this review, I strongly recommend that you visit the hotel website at http://www.mondrianscottsdale.com.  Looks pretty cool, doesn't it?  Now, forget everything you just saw and keep reading. 

When I booked this hotel on Priceline for my annual spring training trip, I was extremely excited.  It looked as though for $86 a night + tax, I was going to stay at a 4-star hotel similar to one of the W Hotels.  In reality, what I got was a remodeled Holiday Inn Express, more pretentious than a house of a young rapper whose album just went double platinum and more tasteless than, well, a house of a young rapper whose album just went double platinum.  As my friend eloquently put it, "pig with lipstick."

We arrived at the hotel around 8 pm, and 2 valets dressed in white linen shirts and pants approached us.  White is the theme here.  EVERYTHING is white.  We walked up the stairs into the lobby, which looked like . . . well, the place where alabaster goes to die.  Ambient lighting revealed alabaster chairs, alabaster clouds hanging from the ceiling, alabaster sheep covered with fake wool and alabaster lamps, adorned with women's derrieres holding up the base.  WOW.

We walked through the white sheer curtains into the front desk area.  The two male clerks at the desk were sporting the Euro trash look with great panache.  Too much product in their hair, and too much chest hair peeking through the unbuttoned shirt collars.  While their voices said "Welcome to Mondrian," the inflection in their voices said "You have no idea how lucky you are that I am talking to you."  I was being helped by a woman, presumably a manager, who looked like Tawny Kitaen from Whitesnake.  "Here I go again on my own . . ."  Didn't she beat up her husband, pitcher Chuck Finley, with a stiletto heeled shoe?  Sorry, there's nothing funny about domestic violence.

Throughout the whole check-in process, no one bothered to ask us about our room preferences, number of beds or any other questions you expect to be asked at a decent hotel.  They were more concerned about getting us out of there, while informing us that parking cost $10 a night.

We drove around the corner to our building.  The hotel is shaped like a giant "U" with a long, narrow pool in the courtyard in the middle.  Each building is three stories high, keeping up with a Holiday Inn Express tradition.  The only difference was, it was painted white.

We got to our room, where everything was, well, WHITE with navy blue accents.  Cottage cheese ceiling reminded guests of the building's 2.5-star past, but cottage cheese walls were masterfully covered by pleated sheer curtains to remind guests of the hotel's 4-star aspirations.  A giant flat screen TV looked almost too modern, but it was still my favorite item in the room.  Clear plastic Kartell chair and nightstand went well with the decor.  Big queen size beds were very comfortable.  The closet door swung open when one least expected it, partially blocking the entrance.  Fire safety FAIL.  

The bathroom looked fine, but not luxurious.  The sliding door was a space saver, but didn't have a lock.  The accent navy blue wall housed 12 hooks - a simple, yet impractical organizer system.  We were given one bar of soap.  Even 2-star hotels give you two: one for your face, and one for your body.  We asked housekeeping for more, and they brought us 2 more bars right away.  We didn't see new soap for the rest of our stay.  On the bright side, however, the soap was imported from Greece.  Is Athens the soap capital of the world?  What's wrong with Ivory soap?  Not once did housekeeping manage to get us the right number of towels.  It was strange to have to request more on a daily basis.  

Everything in this hotel was a la carte.  I am not complaining about the ultra-expensive minibar, which, by the way, included a cap and a pair of flip flops with the Mondrian logo.  I can understand why a can of soda in the minibar is $5.  I can also accept that a breakfast burrito by the pool (a very nice pool, might I add) costs you $17 + 20% gratuity + $3.50 service charge = $24.  However, a hotel music compilation CD for $25, a bottle of Voss for $8 or a bottle of starch for all your ironing needs for $2.50?  Who charges for a crappy hotel CD or starch?  A hotel should be cheap or pretentious, but not both.

The hotel is located within walking distance from Scottsdale Stadium and Old Town Scottsdale, so I would probably stay here again if the price were right.  However, I will definitely lower my expectations for next time, and I strongly recommend you do the same.This hotel might be great at the price point being offered today, but my experience is based on a visit prior to the economic downturn that is currently taking place.

The only real advice I can provide that hasn't been covered in other reviews is that I wouldn't stay in the Zanzabar suite or anything in that stack of rooms.  If you look at the NYNY Hotel from the outside, you will see that there are several "buildings" that make up the rooms of the hotel.  For the Zanzabar Suite (and certainly some other room types) the exterior is green glass. In theory, it sounds nice, but after a few hours in the green glow, I was ready to leave.  It did not provide a good feeling.  Sound strange?  Check it out for yourself.  I have spoken to others who experienced the same thing.

As for the hotel and the amenities, I don't really know what to say.  I don't understand who NYNY is trying to target.  They have magnet stands and Nathan's Famous hot dogs for sale when you walk in, a roller coaster and arcade for kids, and a themed restaurant row.  However, it is all wrapped around a casino that is for adults.  Didn't Vegas give up on the "kid friendly" thing in the 90's?  Time to renovate?  I think they did...oh well.

I can tell you that the worst massage I have ever received came from the spa in this hotel back in 1999.  I can also tell you that the pool is in a terrible location where most of the sunlight is blocked by the towers of hotel rooms.

On a lighter note, I once saw a guy in the NYNY casino win a small jackpot on the Wheel of Fortune machine.  The next day when I walked by the same machine, he was still sitting there.  I asked him how things were going and he said that the machine was still paying out.  He was smiling ear-to-ear.  The day after that when I walked by, the entire bank of machines had been removed from the casino.  I have no further information to share so you will have to decide how much of that is good vs. bad.-The Rooms: we lacked hot water part of our trip; for me most part clean and inviting rooms overall
-The Food: we ate at a Chinese restaurant, Star Trek, and a coffee shop, all of which I wasn't especially impressed with, mainly because of their lack of vegetarians options. 
-The Casino: not too 'hype' like Palms, etc; the casino was not too busy.

Our biggest issue was the big mix up with our reservations - they didn't really honor what we had reserved and stuffed us into a one bedroom room when we requested two beds.

Also, the hotel is way off the strip - it's definitely a far walk.kind of sad this was a top hotel but now it is old and worn out like most to the total rewards hotels.  Rooms need to be upgradedOK, I am just saying..If I am paying $40 for 2 nigiri I expect that when I sit down the hostess does not hit my knee with the table pushing it in before I sit down. I would also hope that the server would not forget our drinks, or new beers/cocktails every damn time we ordered them until the second or third time we ordered them again. It would have been nice to actually get our entire order before giving up and just asking for the bill instead of the missing item, again. Sigh, having to ask the server to remove the items on the bill we never received but had asked for several times was a bummer too.. I will NEVER go here again, unless I am not paying..The first time I visited Vegas was in 2005, and this place was supposed to be some hot stuff. This time around, it is not any more. The place is so run down. The only nice thing about it is the lobby.Meh. I've seen better shows. I think my problem was that we went to this show after experiencing the amazingness that was LOVE, another Cirque show about the Beatles.

This show just seemed tacky and too camp for my tastes. I wish there would have been more coordinated acrobatics, which is what I expected. It was like they thought they got a free pass for mediocrity because there was boobs.The only reason I'm giving this place any stars is because the girls are hot but don't ever use your credit card here. My boyfriend and I both had our card info stolen using our cards. They stole over 1k from me and 400$ from my boyfriend. The place was packed and I'm sure everyone else who used a card dealt with the same bsThis place was in the middle of renovations when I stayed in Vegas.  They charged my debit card a hundred dollars and my credit $300, instead of figuring a way to get that on my bosses card, as I was on a business trip.  The place was confusing and advertised restaurants were no longer in operation.  I liked my room fine and the little bar under the non smoking tower, but I found the service overall to be lackluster and nothing special.March 2014...Stayed at the TI in Vegas for 2 nights. Was in town for a convention, not just for a carefree time.
The room was clean and well stocked. 

First... I went to flip on the light in bathroom and cut my finger on the switch plate. The hard plastic was broken into pieces and the pieces had been fitted back into the switch plate cover. I dislodged them when I cut my finger, proceeded to stop the bleeding, collected all the pieces, wrapped them neatly in a tissue and took them to the front desk in the morning. The manager was unimpressed with my situation and said that someone would go up to look into it. When I arrived back in my room for the evening, my switch plate was still missing pieces.  It was not fixed during my stay.

Next... There is this little, sliding mechanism that opens and closes the window about an inch. This thing would not stay closed,  It was WINDY outside and I love the sound of the wind, but it sounded like a wind tunnel. This was not my only gripe.

Finally... I have stupid food allergies and something on their approved list made me super sick. I only ate at their establishment while in Vegas because I was so afraid of eating anywhere else and getting sick. Oh well...  On a plus side... their staff was so helpful in trying to find me safe foods, I really really appreciate their efforts. The kind lady in the salad area of the buffet was wonderful and very helpful.

I'm really sad to leave a 2 star for them and will return again... not to be critical, but to enjoy the time that I know TI is worthy of providing.they really should consider investing some money on this place and renovating the crap out of it. It's such a GREAT location on the Strip that i find it such a sad waste. i stayed here years ago because it was part of a really affordable package (also, for some reason, hotel only rates for this place can be pricier than you think i've noticed). the experience there was not horrendous, and found it easier to just laugh at the whole thing. the rooms are dank and musty, noisy since you have a lot of college meat running up and down the halls. and finding your room is a challenge, its a crazy maze of rooms on each floor. wear comfortable shoes. i tried my best to just fly by the casinos on my way out of the hotel each day. cesars and bellagio right across the street. once again, cant go wrong on the location. noticed a little bar downstairs called Tequila Joes...all i have to say is HAHHAHAHAHHA. 

I would not stay there again. in vegas, you literally get what you pay for.Four stars?!?  C'mon people.

We ate here for lunch, right at the hottest point of the day.  It would have been a much nicer atmosphere if there were misters or something to cool me down, cause it was hot as a mofo out there!  It was so hot that our butter melted completely in 5 minutes.  I think this would be the only time I would ever prefer chilled butter over room temperature. We thought about sitting inside to escape the heat, but it was dark and depressing in the main dining room.

We started off with the mussels, which I liked after having one bite but with every bite I continued to take, they just kept getting worse and worse.  I had to quit after 3 bites because they became way to salty for my liking.  Also, there were about 3 unopened mussels, which is grounds for send-back...but I decided to go easy on them, until my entree that is.

For my main dish, I chose the seared salmon with a lemon butter sauce over orzo.  It was so bland and tasteless, I sent that bitch ass dish back.  The description on the menu made it sound so good,  and I was looking forward to that orzo, but it sucked in real life.  Sorry, but I have no pity for these huge casinos and I am expecting something not dissapointing when I'm dining at any one of them.  My bf liked his dish, though.  Maybe I chose the wrong thing, but I doubt I'll be giving them another chance to redeem themselves.

The view of the Bellagio fountains was entertaining, which was a plus.  Also, its right on the strip so people watching is fun also.  Thats about it as far as the positives go for me.  Oh, and the bread was really good.  Eh, I'll give 'em 2.5.I don't know what the appeal of this place is..it has almost 900 reviews    ( at the time of me writing this review)...and a four star rating...and it was such a disappointment. I think people that eat here mainly go to eat out on the terrace and people-watch. Sole redeeming factor- great fries.Went to this restaurant because a friend wanted to try and had made a reservation for us there. Somehow we still had to wait with reservations... Considering it was a french restaurant with a large amount of review I figured it was okay to have high standards. Boy was I wrong. 

Hospitality was great, very accommodating to change my order without any further questions. 

I order the Chicken Grandmere and it came out too salty and dry. It was so dry I drank 2 glass of water and gave up after eating maybe an eighth of it. The waiter was generous to switch my order to the Chicken Paillard which came very fast! However the chicken was again dry and the flavor just didn't taste right. 

After we left, I went to McD to get myself a 10 piece nugget meal.You know, I stayed here, and figured out something...

IT'S not that great.. heck stay at Treasure Island or somewhere else for a better time (Mirage, Monte Carlo, etc...) for the same $$ if not cheaper...

I'm not into slanted rooms and elevator.. the fun wares off..QUICKLY....

Go somewhere else.  Promise.Not the standards I would hope

Staying at the Luxor for 7 days. First time in Vegas, and I have to say I was expecting more for the money.

Pros: 
Spacious washroom with both shower and soaker tub.
Clean
Plenty of closet space

Cons: 
"Upgraded" from Pyramid room to a room on the third floor of the East Tower - roof level with a lovely view of the roof, air intake units (complete with constant humming), and the side of the pyriamid. Would have been nice to see a tree, plant, or even sunshine.
Looonnnnnggggg ethernet cable behind the television stretches across the room and almost reaches the desk. Tripped over  the cable several times. No wireless internet
Room service dishes sat in the hallway two days before being picked up from the room next door - I don't get the impression they are service oriented.
A maze of hallways and elevators to manouver through to get to the room.
Smoking in the casino common areas - smell like smoke at the end of every day

Overall, it's a hotel. For Vegas, I guess I just had my hopes set a bit higher.This place was pretty cool back in the day when it first opened. Upon my return, I was highly disappointed. There is literally almost nothing inside that carries an Egyptian theme. Its just so bland and boring. Half the shops were vacant.  Gaming looked unappealing. Did not stay here as a Guest so cannot comment on rooms.After many good reviews, I decided on trying Craftsteak at the MGM Grand.  My husband and I each had the surf and turf with a fillet and crab legs.  The fillets were a bit dry and overcooked. I think I had a similar steak at Outback. Nothing special. The crablegs were fine, but had too much butter. The weird thing is that nothing is plated. It is served to you in a skillet. I guess to keep the food hot, but I expected a plated dinner.  Overall, it was nothing special and the only impressive thing were the steak knives. Nice and sharp with a special spot for your index finger.I was working at the Hard Rock Hotel for five days and ended up eating at almost every establishment there.

The service at Pink Taco was terrible! I was placing an order for take out and the girl at the counter was so rude. She acted as though I was really bothering her and that I was stupid. This is completely unacceptable.

The food at Pink Taco was alright. Not terrible, not that good either. I had the Baja Fish tacos. The plate included three street sized tacos, rice, and beans.

The tacos tasted fine, but the fish inside was measly. Also, the texture on one was totally overcooked and tough.

If you can, skip this place. There are better options at Hard Rock (e.g. Culinary Dropout, Nobu) and much much better options at other hotels.I hate giving less-than-stellar reviews, but if I go by the Yelp star code, well, I've definitely had better than Bouchon.

I've been here in my pre-yelp days and never had a bad word to say about the place. Sadly, my last experience wasn't up to par.

The atmosphere here is lovely and our server was nothing but pleasant. I started with a cup of the French onion soup and my friend had a salad - no complaints on either.

I was actually looking for a rib eye, but since there wasn't one on the menu, I went with Steak Frites. A pan-seared 9 oz. flat iron, caramelized shallots & maître d'hôtel butter served with French fries. When it arrived, it looked and smelled wonderful, but upon first bite I could immediately tell something was wrong.

There was a very strong and very unpleasant metallic after taste to that first bite. My friend gave me a bite of his NY strip and it tasted the way steak was supposed to. Then I thought maybe the butter or shallots had burned and that's why my bite was off. So I scraped everything off the piece of meat and went in for another bite. Same story. Odd, off-putting taste all over again. I hate to use the word "rancid", but well, that's what it tasted like.

The waiter came to check on us and I ended up sending the steak back. As my waistline will attest, I have never sent anything back in my entire life. The waiter was very nice, though I think he may be new as he was a bit flustered and nervous. I was glancing at the menu to see if there was anything else I wanted to try and though he was trying to be helpful the waiter offering to wait for me while I selected another entree felt a little pressured. I hurriedly ordered the salmon and while it came out fast and was tasty, it wasn't really what I wanted.

I was surprised and disappointed by the experience here. I know this place can be great, but with such a huge variety of fantastic restaurants in Las Vegas, I think I'll have to move on from Bouchon.Food was decent, but nothing life-changing. Yes, I know it's supposed to be "simple French bistro food" and it was ok but...

Just because Thomas Keller got a lot of money to slap his name on it, you are not really eating at a Thomas Keller resto unless it's French Laundry or Per Se. This is just a very slightly higher-end La Madeleine with inflated Strip hotel prices. 

I gave it two stars because of the noise and flaky service. For food alone I'd easily give three maybe four. It's a cavernous space and they really try to pack 'em in and flip the tables as quickly as possible to generate volume, pretty much the antithesis of a what a genuine, relaxed bistro experience in France is like. The noise level was almost deafening. My dining companion was seated right across from me and we were literally shouting at each other during several points in the meal. A conversation was pretty much impossible and neither of us are hearing-impaired. Although my ears were ringing all that night after...this is absolutely not the place for a relaxed and intimate dinner. Don't be fooled into thinking that just because it's "French" food.

Courses came out at odd intervals and aside from when it was time for us to pay and run out (flip those tables!) our server just didn't seem to be very good at his job. Maybe he was having an off day, got caught in the weeds...but I honestly think in his case he's just a bad waiter. 

Started with a nice platter of oysters. They didn't make us sick so that's good. Not that I expected them to. 

My dining companion had the roast chicken which really was delicious and so well done. Chicken is usually one of the most boring things to order on any restaurant menu but this is an exception. If you've always wanted to try one of those flavorful, moist classic French roast chickens you've heard are so good, here is a place to start. My trout almandine was quality. Simply prepared and I liked it. The rhubarb cake dessert was tasty.

This was my first visit back to Bouchon after I had gone several times a few years ago. Prior to that it was always for breakfast and lunch. It's was less crowded and quieter at those times. However, service there has never been especially good and it suffers the endemic Strip celeb chef phoning it in for the tourists problem. 

I'd recommend going for lunch or breakfast (especially during the week if you can swing it) avoiding weekend dinner there and not setting your expectations for food and certainly not for service, all that high.Service was excellent, but food was mediocre. My bf and I stopped by for lunch since it looked crowded and we figured that the food was good. He got the fish and chips and I got spaghetti with meatballs. The fish came out as fish nuggets with Mcdonald's style fries, I've never seen fish and chips look so cheap, its always been fillets. Half the meatballs were cold, and the others were warm. I barely touched my plate, but the bread was good, and olive dips were definitely the best I've ever had. Guess I should've stuck to ordering the restaurant's namesake.I think I can start spelling "disappointed," "Las Vegas Premium Outlets." 

"Vegas has amazing shopping." "The outlets get you amazing deals." I guess I may have heard these phrases one too many times because I went there and my heart broke. My dreams were dashed. I think I heard the sound of a unicorn dying as well... 

Maybe it was the time of year, maybe I'll try again but despite the amazing number of shops nothing was actually a deal. Everything appeared to be normal price and the selection at every store was seriously lacking. The same stores at the Seattle Outlets yield a lot more selection. And as far as price, I did end up buying one dress, and after the exchange rate (didn't have to pay duty though) I saved a grand total of $4 from buying it at home. 

The cool thing was the mist spraying trees in the concourse to keep you from melting, I really appreciated those. Also, if you're taking the bus, you might want to rethink it. The deuce will get you to the transfer point quick enough and then the 108 bus only comes once every 25 minutes there, consider cabbing if you have the cash. 

All in all, I would just say that there HAS to be a better place to shop.Did you go to Vegas for a win?
Shibuya, located in MGM Grand is the dealer. It's well packaged but full of bluffs as soon as you sit down on the table. 

Decor? Very nice and modern, but what does it have to do with Japanese? For Americans, it's a good bluff. They like that kind of culture. Honestly? It reminds me of a club ambiance. 

Flip the card and your the looser. What do I mean? 
We walked in on reservation. As soon as I saw the sushi bar and the chefs, I knew it wasn't going to be Japanese. The chefs were obviously Chinese and didn't have the professional look. 

Don't call the cards, your screwed! 
The dinner for 6 came out to be around $1000. 
It wasn't omakase or anything special. 
We had; Uni fried rice, sashimi (toro, bluefin, hamachi, mirugai), grilled steak, pork belly, rainbow row, dragon roll, oysters.

Rainbow and dragon was as bad a buffets. Soggy rice, low quality fish, and over drizzled with sauce. Even worse than those jive ass rolls. 

Sashimi wasn't prepared well. The daikon looked like it was prepared by machines. The fish was cut in weird proportions. Also displayed in bad manner. Bluefin was tearing apart as if the sushi chef went back and forth on the slices. Oh, did i mention that the chef forgot to put wasabi? We asked the waiter for wasabi, and we got some processed green stuff in huge portions. 


+ service was great
+ for trying to be Japanese; they had Hitachino beer and some high end sake (at least they tried hard).  
+ for casino style decorations and modern atmosphere; but what does this have to do with Japanese style?

- should at least give real wasabi for the price they were charging. 
- fish just wasnt prepared right. the sushi chef definitely wasn't Japanese.
- whats with teppanyaki setup in a japanese sushi restaurant? 
- very very fusion
- overpriced for the quality

How did this restaurant get 4 stars on over 500+ reviews? 
I guess because it's Vegas. People are used to the big spending and trendy atmosphere. They really don't come to vegas for the high quality well prepared food. If your wallet is too heavy and want to thin it out, come for a treat. 

Good Luck and happy winning at VegasAck.  

Being Madison's "Favorite Birthday Bar" means you get free cheap beer on your birthday and mug.  But it also means that you have to spend your birthday eating bar food that's easily bested by numerous places within walking distance of the Gritty and enduring the obnoxious sports bar with balloons atmosphere.

Any friend that takes you here on your birthday is no friend of yours.The venue is pretty cool.

But the service sucks here.

We paid for bottle service, since it was for a bachelor party and wanted to make sure everyone got in.

The host was so so, we always had to poor our own drinks, and the bouncer thought very highly of himself.  

Needless to say we made it a fun night, but it wasn't because we were at PURE.  

I wouldn't recommend the place.  Maybe i need to go back again just to make sure it wasn't a fluke.Pure is OK-not too great compared to other clubs in LV these days. The line was RIDICK-even with the VIP list and all that. It was too freakin hot in there and the only bathroom was on the top floor-no bueno. I shortly left after being admitted for free. I did enjoy the hip hop room and the nice man who let us sit at tables until they were reserved. But, Ill stick to XS next time thanksI got bottle service, $425 cheapest bottle, really depends where your table is at, and the music was very techno-y, too much of that, females mostly stay downstairs where the music is better, prob wont go back thereIf you like bland food and bad customer service, this is your place!

Nothing special and nothing that stood out as great.  The price is good for mediocre food.  I guess for this price, you can't expect much. 

Our waiter was unpleasant and when we asked him for coffee, he acted as if we asked for a pint of his blood.  Then he brought the coffee with a nasty attitude.  

Next time, I rather pay double at Bellagio than ever eat here again.The quality of food has completely dropped off. I been looking forward to this buffet ever since I found out I was going back to Vegas but it was nothing like I remembered. There was nothing there that was absolutely delicious. This will probably be the last time I eat here and will stick with Wynn/Rio/Planet Hollywood buffets. Perhaps we ate here on a bad day (Thursday). The only good thing bout this place is that the waiter is very attentive and is always checking on you to see if you need anything else.I'm downgrading them two stars for their lunch selection.  Yes the price is cheaper for lunch but the qualify and the selection is a lot less as well.  They served flank steak and turkey at their carving stations and both cuts of meats were dry.  The sushi station is very limited to just veggie, California roll, and at request spicy tuna hand rolls.  The miso soup is really salty too.  The seafood menu is very limited too.  

I guess its still an above average buffet but I was disappointed as dinner here the last time was really good.Very disappointing!!!!! The food selection was small especially at the sushi station. Only California rolls and some simple sushi available. The dessert selection was sad. The service was not good at all. The lady who stayed at the sushi station basically just threw the spring rolls on my plate!!! I heard so much about the buffet here and was really expecting a good time. Turned out it was truly disappointing.Alright, so I paid a good $40 dollars (including tip) of my hard earned money to eat here cause I've heard so much about it. My parents told me I needed to go because the food and selections are just incredible. After the longest half-hour of my life waiting in line, and apparently that's a shorter wait. It was after 7pm so thankfully most the tourists already ate.

The selections are alright, I've seen better. The taste wasn't that great. I was extremely disappointed with that! I've been to a better buffet down in Vegas, and that's at Rio.

Although, I'll give it to my waiter, and cooks behind the food - they were very, very friendly.
Oh, but here's a negative. I'm not even sure if it's the only bathroom in there, it would be ridiculous if there was. But I believe I remember only 3 STALLS IN THE BATHROOM!? You're kidding rght????

No, I would never come here again. People create such a hype for no reason at all.Move b@%ch GET OUT THE WAY GET OUT THE WAY

A girl needs room to dance. My advice to Tao.... a little less women in tubs and more dancing space for those of us who can't afford the velvet rope treatment. And a wait of 1.5 hrs to get in and pay 20 bucks..... Thank God I live in san francisco!I really wanted to like TAO but it was WAAAYYYYYYY too crowded to dance. We left after 15 minutes....**Tao Club**

///PROS///
- Great space--ambiance (lounge/dinner floor)--although we did not eat here. Could not get reservations until 11:30--so went to Sushi Samba instead. It reminded me of Tao NY so assume the food would be just as good. 
- I was free (husband $20)--cheaper than SF ($20 each at most clubs w/out headliner)
- Liked the red light district girls touch--reminded me of Webster Hall (NY, circa 1990)
- Liked the dancers--but no where near as out there/theatrical as say Webster Hall (NY, circa 1990)--or even Ruby Skye (SF now)
- OK music 2nd floor, main space (electronic mixed with Top--that is until Hip Hop took over)
- We pushed our way through all spaces and ended up to the right of the DJ booth leaning up against a railing above the dance floor. At least we could "watch" but as I was there to dance (that was my primary objective for our weekend away) a bit miffed it was impossible. 
- Below our spot were some Dom Perignon swilling rappers with betties dancin' about. No idea who they were (others seemed to) but swilling directly out of a bottle, texting and making out were all funny to watch. They had 4 open bottles at all times available for 5 people--and a corner booth with plenty of space. Too bad we're not them.
- Snow and money cam flying out of the ceiling--cool touches. Funny that most people didn't notice they were bills--which is probably whyTao sent guys out to pick up the rogues. Cool Vegas touch in any event.

///CONS///
- On VIP list--showed up a little after midnight and the door guys said they closed it at midnight --thus waited in "a" line (there were several, uncertain what was what)
- Completely convinced that if I were with a group of girls--I would have gone in. But with my husband--um, a male, we had to wait.
- NO--none--zilch  space to friggin' move let alone dance at 12:30ish on the 2nd floor. The actual dance floor in the main room on the 2nd floor is amazingly SMALL. It is not comparable to say Ruby Skype or 1015 in SF. Both of which I frequented for years with crowds, huge headliners and space to dance. At times I had VIP tables--but they didn't take up the whole damn joint like Tao Club Vegas.
- Unless you pay 1K (no where near the dance floor) or 2K (near the dance floor) you are NOT VIP--and cannot move, get a drink or dance. For 4+ people not all that bad--but for 2? 
-  It took us a good 20 to get the first cocktail--standing at the bar.  The three female bartenders would NOT even look at us. As I have been a bartender at a large club early nineties--service really gets to me. And there was no need for them to be quite to bitchy. Acknowledgement goes a long way. Normally an amazing tipper. Not so tonight.
- 3rd floor electronica not open--even though we'd asked concierge and door guys if Tao was spinning electronica/house Sat night prior to wasting time/money. If it was "so" busy why wasn't floor 3 open?
- Hip-hop in the smaller dance room on floor 2--but then took over the main dance floor as well (UGH! So left earlier than expected)

///IF YOU GO...///
- Make sure there is a headliner of music YOU like--then pay for a VIP table near the dance floor. This will enable you to at least get cocktails, dance in place, on tables, dividers and sofas. Otherwise you are screwed.
- But if you have frequented--or still frequent large clubs in major cities--level set your expectations.

///WOULD WE GO TO TAO CLUB AGAIN?///
- Not unless we had a table near the dance floor with electronica/house as the main event.

+ Sushi SambaWow! I'm stunned at the high average rating of this place. It found this place mediocre, and quite disappointing.

The fellas and I went to Vegas for the weekend and got three suites here. The rooms weren't bad, but they certainly didn't "wow" me with their plush-ness. The worst thing about them was how dark they were. The walls were painted dark grey, and all the interior design was similarly color-themed. No matter how many lights were on, and with all the blinds open, the room was still dreary. 

The buffet was good. Props for that.

The Brazilian BBQ at Rum Jungle was a letdown. See my review of Espetus in San Francisco for what Brazilian BBQ should be. At Rum Jungle, the food was okay, but the experience wasn't what it should have been. Rather than pick your own side dishes from a serve-yourself salad bar, the waiters decided what side dishes were coming, in what quantity, and how fast. Hardly the self-gorging experience Brazilian BBQ should be. Same with the meats. 

The last straw happened when I went to hit the gym one morning. I walked up and was told "there is a $20 fee for hotel guests to use the gym." My head spun around. That's right, $20 for PAYING GUESTS to lift weights. Call me crazy, but I think that if an activity costs the hotel nothing, it should cost the guest nothing. Outrageous. Wait it gets better. I grudgingly forked over 20 bucks, and thought: this is likely to be the nicest gym I have ever been in. There will probably be strippers handing me my weights. Holy nope. This facility was a POS. I have been in nicer gyms in crappy apartment complexes. The whole place was probably 1000 square feet, with only 400 square feet devoted to weights. The place was lit by very dim fluorescent lights. Flattering. There was no free weight bench press. WTF? Talk about standard equipment! I was pissed the whole time, and I had a shitty workout as a result. I had dropped $250 in the casino that weekend, but that $20 hurt way worse. In the end, I protested to the front desk, and without contest, they reimbursed me my $20, so that was good.

Overall, this place is mediocre at best. I will choose to stay somewhere else next time.From the looks,  this hotel rock ... but don't be fooled,  it's a shit hotel made to look nice from the outside. I'm on floor 5 and can hear every sound from the club below. The walls are paper thin and I won't be ever staying here again. Make up on a huge pig.Server was nice and attentive. Thus the two stars. Food had zero redeeming qualities. Mushy and flavorless.Description: Run-downed.  

After watching O and Le Reve a couple years ago I figured let's watch KA, since it was a staple of MGM and close to Aria.  The performers dropped their weapons, the special effects were outdated.  After doing a Wiki on KA, the show is 5 years old; no wonder.

The only cool part is the inverted stage. And the soothing music.We went here to celebrate a friend's engagement. We had dinner on a Friday night. The place was freezing, service was lackluster and the food was even more disappointing. $38 for a small and blah tasting salmon filet. 

A redeeming quality? Um - everyone loved the mac n cheese side dish?

Wouldn't recommend.My wife and I both had fish, and frankly our fish was not fresh, but was starting to go off. They did comp a significant part of the meal when we complained, so I have bumped them up to 2 starts, but really guys. This is a really expensive restaurant specializing in seafood - the seafood had better be really fresh!I am too hot for you and you and you!

What  kind of car do you drive?

Buy me a drink!

Do you have a table?

No.

Get out of my face.Best time ever: my buddy Alan refused entry because of his shoes, even though the white dude in front of him got in with the same shoes, no problem. Also, my friend Greg got booted because he was so drunk that he puked on the dance floor on the second level. If you've been here, you know why that's so funny.After a night of lots and lots of drinking and waking up with somewhat of a hangover, my buddies and I head down to the pool for a few hours before we picked ourselves up to find something to eat.  After returning to the room and talkin' it over, 2 of the 4 insisted that the Grand Lux at the Venetian would be the best...or supposedly so.

Making the trek to the Venetian, we walked in and from the outside, the restaurant looks decent...nice decor, ok setting (not too noisy from the casino area although very close by) and clean, we were seated by a friendly waiter.

Surprisingly, the restaurant wasn't crowded even though we arrived shortly after noon time.  

Moving on, we got to our table and the waiter handed us with our menus.  My friend asked how much the drinks from the bar would cost and he responded as anywhere between ($7~11)...fair enough...it's Vegas...you're gonna be charged quite a bit....

Thirty minutes down the line, we finally got our food....and unfortunately, not that impressive...would've gotten the same deal elsewhere at a much lower price.

Toward the end, the waiter wasn't very friendly with service.  

Overall, I know that there are so many other places in Vegas to eat...buffet/upscale restaurants available, and I choose not to come back to this place ever.  It's too pricey, and the quality of the food isn't as impressive as first thoughts.I was so excited about eating here for my half-birthday dinner.  What a disappointment!  Someone told me the calamari was awesome...  The calamari was mostly shrimp... Had  a texas tea to drink $10, didnt even give me a buzz. 

The other disappointment I had was that I went in person to make a reservation.  They told me "We will hold your reservation for 5 minutes" which I thought was pretty rude, but when I got there they didnt even have my reservation in the system! WTF?

After all was done I felt sick the rest of the night and couldnt even enjoy myself @ the club.  Wont eat here again.REVIEW IS FOR LOUNGE

Place is old, dirty, and in need of a makeover. Older crowd (40's).  Bought an all you can drink wristband for $75 (Halloween weekend) and was assured Jameson, Goose, ect were on the top shelf list.  After a group of 18 forks over the money and we order our first rounds, we are told Jameson and Goose were not included but Patron and Crown were. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

But...it does have a great view.The Greene House had been talked up by a few of my friends so I knew I had better check it out.  I am accustomed to the unique and delicious meals created at Tru Food and expected something better due to the higher prices, but it was not delivered. The service and atmosphere were great, but the entree I ordered was something that would come out of the Applebees kitchen.  

I ordered the trout which is something normally prepared very simply and although the ingredient list in the meal's description did have quite a few ingredients it was how they were put together that ruined the meal.  When the dish was brought to the table I thought, "this isn't mine" because of how it looked.  Trout should be served very simply with no breading, gravy or anything else to cover the taste of the fish.  The people at the next table even commented on it.  

I did bring this up to the server who also thought they overdo it on the trout.  My friend had another dish that was quite good.  I'll stick with Tru Food.the food is decent. i would recommend the carrot cinnamon cumin soup every time!

^ i started writing that about two months ago....ive been back once or twice since.

the service leaves MUCH to be desired. i don't know what it is about servers down here, but when i served up in northern az...we did something called hustling. they take forever to bring you anything you may need.

most of what i have tried has been a bit bland. except for the amazing carrot cinnamon cumin soup. lol.Like others have mentioned, the service at Margaritaville leaves much to be desired. It took about 20 minutes to get menus, about 45 minutes for our food to arrive, another 10 minutes waiting for someone to bring us utensils. We went for breakfast and my omelette (something with crab and shrimp) was very good. Another person got the 'boatmeal' that came with a generous serving of fresh fruit on the side. The margaritas, however, not so good. Such a shame.

Our waiter looked like Seth Rogen, though. That's always nice.The food is bad!!!! Drinks were good, so was the service, but I have never had a worse mushroom cheeseburger in my life. My boyfriend got a chicken sandwhich and couldn't finish it. How do u mess up basics like that?? Gross :(Poor service and lack luster items..nothing special about the food since everything was just basic Italian food. It's all right as a basic place to eat after jersey boys!Itty bitty portions of average Asian fusion food.I didn't really LOVE my experience here, but for those who enjoy creative and fusioned sushi or a good sushi happy hour, this is a great place to go.  The menu is pretty impressive with all sorts of sushi concoctions that I have never seen, but I like my sushi pretty standard and not too crazy, so I ordered (ironically) the Crazy Horse roll, which is tuna, yellowtail, and salmon rolled with avocado and topped with tobiko.  I don't have TOO much to complain about regarding the size of the rolls (they were decent) or the taste (it was ok considering this is tempe, arizona), but I think I was most turned off by the service and prices of the restaurant.

When my friends and I walked in, happy hour was happening, so it's understandable that the wait staff were busy, but come on.  Seat us already.  Or at least acknowledge us.  When we were finally seated, our waitress kept huffing and puffing while taking our order.  I understand she may have been having a bad day or have been stressed, but whatever.  Stay profesh.  Then, one of my friends orders the tempura mix, and when it came out, it was missing the prawns, so what happens?  The waitress brings out a single fried prawn on a plate...15 minutes later.  Um...no.  The age-dofu was also kind of meh.  On top of that, I was confused about who was actually serving our table because the girl wait staff kept tag-teaming our table with the guy wait staff, and even then, the service was not awesome.  The whole experience altogether just kind of totaled a bit too much for a sort of blah experience, so I'm pretty sure I'll be going elsewhere for sushi around these parts.I went here largely because of all the positive reviews on Yelp.  Mistake.  There was nothing terribly wrong with the food or drink, but it was priced on the high side.

There sushi seemed no better than any other mediocre sushi and was a little expensive. 4.50 and up for nigiri.  A large Sapporo: $7, Large (cheep) Sake: $7.  Many of the rolls are very expensive and covered with mayo -- they call it wasabi sauce, but might as well be mayo.

The spicy tuna and spicy scallops were not spicy at all.  The waitress mentioned they they have to make them even for people who are very sensitive to spice.  (If you don't like spice, don't order spicy! But here, you can.)

Also:  What's with the dance music?  Hard to relax with that $hit pulsing away.

Bottom line:  expensive, and only mediocre.  We won't be back.  

Try Sushi Kee on Warner/Rural.  The ratings on yelp are only 3.5 stars, but better sushi that this place!I was extremely disappointed with this restaurant, not only with their food, but also with their service.  First of all, we waited for at least an hour before our food came out of the kitchen.  That was absolutely unacceptable for a restaurant as renowned as DB.  Secondly, their food was unbelievably mediocre.  I don't remember the name of the dish I ordered, but what I do remember is that it was a fish dish and the fish was dry, the broth/sauce was too salty, not to mention, the portion was ridiculously tiny.  

Even though I was not impressed with their food, I enjoyed their bread a lot, especially their fig bread.  

I expected more from this restaurant and this place had definitely failed to live up to its reputation.This place has an awesome steak and ahi tuna! But sad to say THEY GAVE MY PARTY  a HORRIBLE service! my experince with prime was 7 years ago and i couldnt shake off the horrible memory.. We were celebrating for my friend who was leaving for the navy, i give the ambiance a 4 star and the food a 4 star. everything was pricey but worth every bite. The thing i did not like most was the service! Just because our party was young and we did not order bottle service the waiter decided to ignore us! After we left the restaurant we approaced the person in charge and told them how horrible the service was. all he said was " what can i do to make it right" , like all he cared about was giving us comps thinking we were these snooty little rich kids who just wanted to complain. All we said was NOTHING we just wanted to inform you, because our intentions was not to get anything for free we just wanted to inform the person in charge of the horrible waiter... Would I dine again at PRIME? perhaps i really did enjoy their food and Prime Patio is to die for giving you an awesome view of the fountains as you sip on your coffee..2 stars is generous after my last trip there which was on Thanksgiving. It was my 4th year in a row eating here on Thanksgiving. I booked a month out and was told the earliest available was 7:15pm. We were seated quickly but that's the only thing that went right. We ordered all parts of the 5 course family style holiday menu and half of what we ordered showed up. They ran out of food at an "all you can eat" meal. Instead of being upfront with us we got a dog and pony type of magic show "disappearing food". When I approached the manager he asked" what do you want me to do about it?" Are you kidding me? $35 per person and you do not have what we want? I am fairly certain I will never go back, that's coming from a Chicago guy who loves Italian food. Also their regular menu item portions have been cut in half and the price slashed a buck or two. Lame.Bleh. 
Mediocre at best. 
To state the obvious it is a buffet.. not a 5 star restaurant. Either way, I was disappointed. 

Ive been to a whole ton of buffets in Vegas, we come at least once a year. The Rio is supposed to have one of the top buffets in vegas. Ask around. The Rio is the place to hit.. or the Bellagio. I digress. 

The food was okay. One star up from Hometown i suppose. I dont remember the last time i went to one, but... theres a reason for it. They suck. 

I suppose a buffet is a place to stuff your face with everything u can think of.. at once,get full and pass out. Definitely not a place for quality. Starch, meat, some more starch, and a salad bar. Goodie!

Ohh! and the vegeterian options? Minimal at best. Lettuce and macaroni and cheese? What a meal!

1 star for having bananas foster... and okay gelato.I've been to alot of buffets and this one was just "OK". They had a wide selection of food. anything you can think of they have. They had a good selection of desserts. Overall, the service was ok. the food was ok. Place was big, alot of seats and tables. Luckily it wasnt that busy when I was there.Recently relocated to Vegas though we have dined here in the past as tourists. Decided to experience Carnival Buffet again for Sunday night dinner as they were offering 50% discount for locals. They don't do this anymore, only 25% so not only is the quality subpar but it is overpriced. Got there shortly before 4pm so there was no line but caution: if you arrive prime time the lines get longer! Atmosphere & layout is good but rate it 2 stars because if you were paying full price $29.99 per person with players card it is not a good value compared to other Vegas buffets. Negatives: if you like crab (we do!)  Carnival's are the snow crab which is obviously the cheapest & smallest they can procure, a bit salty, & lacks meat & sweet taste. My spouse commented the salmon he had was dry and tough. Salad bar is OK but no Caesar blend & nothing special. Selections are varied but nothing really stands out. Some other buffets in Vegas similarly or much lower priced offer much bigger better crab & unlimited beer or wine but at Carnival you have to pay significantly extra for wine, etc.  Positives are: pleasant staff, good Prime Rib &  shrimp dim sum, gellato is good. Best can give Carnival Buffet at Rio right now is just a half hearted recommendation.Maybe I'm not being fair since I've only visited this venue once, and it was for a free Camel show, but I was thoroughly disappointed by the space. I was looking forward to seeing what was done with the old Utopia, a place I visited not regularly but quite memorably in my formative years.  The design of the space was very ho-hum, contradictory to the edgy rock-and-roll vibe it seems to want to portray.  The large expanse of space between the stage and the back bar begs for levels of some sort (besides the one lining the stage right wall which was being used as a VIP area during my visit), both for design and utilitarian elements.  With beers coming in at about $6 and mixed drinks starting at $8 (and apparently from other reviews, that's on the cheap side for this place), you're left with a little sticker shock.  I suppose that shouldn't be the case since it is a Strip property, but you might want to consider starting somewhere else and cabbing it over if you want to get your drink on with your music.

The bands sounded good at least.  Acoustically, the place kicks the pants off of some of the other mid-size venues in town like the Joint.  I would have loved to have been able to go onto the second level and check out what the view was like from up there.  The bands load and unload right outside of the stage door, which gives you plenty of access to accost them with messages from former classmates, not that I'd know anything about that.  (The message was very warmly received and my friend Esther and I didn't look like stalkers, thank you very much.)

Basically, it would take a band I REALLY want to see playing at a PHENOMENAL price to get me back into this venue again.  It was thoroughly blah and nothing about it helped enhance the experience.Was not impressed with Paris buffet.  I know I am in the minority here, but it really wasn't any better than cruise cuisine.  Just across from the buffet is the crepe place (LaCrepes?) and it was fabulous, and the bakery next door is also wonderful.The line was out of control and the food wasn't it worth it! I went for dinner but it was very disappointed and if you don't like creeps the dessert section is disappointing! Go to the restaurant next door in the Paris.... Way better!Food was so-so. Service was so-so. Location was noisy, but then again it's the Paris Hotel in Vegas.

Would I recommend it? If you can't get into another place, yes. Otherwise, it's nothing special, really.It wasn't my first time dining here, probably the 4th or 5th but I think I finally hit a wall with this place. The other times were semi decent and warranted returning visits. After this weekend though, I'm over it. We had a big party so we understood that it was going to take some time to get a table. Even the wait for the table itself wasn't bad. The suck came when we sat down. I'm not going to play the blame game and start pointing fingers either because our waitress seemed genuinely sweet. I just don't know whose fault was it so I might as well blame the entire establishment.

We got our table and menu. Some time passed before we were greeted or quite frankly acknowledged period. It was the first meal of the day and we were all craving a bite especially after a long intoxicating night. When we finally got the greet, just like any standard operating restaurant policy, drink orders were taken. Time ticked. Table of guys, trust me when I say guys know what they want to eat within a few minutes especially when you're hungry like a bear. Okay, drinks come and orders taken. Here is where it gets ugly.

Again, I've grown up in the restaurant business and understand when there's a big party it takes some time to get all the food out for a big table. Of course, the restaurants my family owned were all small hole in the walls. We were in Vegas, Paris hotel, 24 hour café, get your cooking line straight or maybe you need a Chef Ramsay visit? We sat, sat, sat. Friend got so bored, he passed around the keno sheet and we were picking numbers. He took three trips to the keno booth and still no food. Draw Something, Words with Friends, was being played by 80% of the table. There was a table of five women who sat down some time after us and they were half way through their meal. What did we have, bread & butter. Yeah, it was good bread & butter but where the F is my meal? I didn't order Australian Wagyu Steak. It was sunny side eggs, potatoes, bacon, and toast. Most of the guys on the table ordered soup/salad/sandwich combos. How long does it really take? Tick tock, tick tock, how deep does the rabbit hole go? No exaggerations. Trust me, I don't like to bash restaurants (just look at the majority of my reviews; mostly positive) but this was ridiculous. 

We finally got our meals and yeah it was decent. Nothing bad to say about our food. The guy who kept refilling our drinks must've felt bad because he kept bringing drinks over in attempt to keep us calm. Before most of us were done, we asked for the check in advance because seriously, we were done with the place & wanted to just roll. 

We were just looking for a simple and quick lunch but this ordeal turned into an unnecessary two hour+ fiasco. Not even an apology for the lag but whatever, you guys are Vegas and people will still return. Money will continue to flow inwards, but I will happily throw my extra cash and help put the strippers through college before I return to this cafe.I guess the saying 'you get what you pay for' is true for this particular buffet. I've experienced much better. I won't ever come back because there are much better buffets around the strip. Sorry.Like all the food on Vegas' strip, OVER PRICED.  I don't think it was worth paying $16.00 for a bowl of beef noodle soup.  If this was the best beef noodle soup I ever had,then maybe I am more willing to pay for it. 

The noodle came in a large ceramic bowl that is loaded with noodles and beef, but too little soup.  The ratio of soup to noodle is out of balanced.  Only 1/3 of the bowl was filled with soup and the rest noodles.  For some people who like to eat a lot, maybe those extra noodles would help, but to me, it's gorse.  To make the matter worse, the noodles are soggy, not tender and chewy at all.   Blah, will not come here again.Gross over price noodles but it is at bellagio so... Overrated...Much like the rest of the strip, this place is ridiculously overpriced and the food isn't that good. If you're hungry but don't feel like a sandwich, entrees will run from $25-$35. Go to a Buffet and get your money's worth of food, if not in quantity at least it'll have quality.Kahunaville is just a typical tourist restaurant, ok food with an overpriced tag. The food is truly very mediocre and there is really nothing special to it. The service is just ok, everyone seems to be very busy and just running everywhere. However, I would recommend this place for quick drinks as they have a very pleasing atmosphere. Also at night time they open the dance floor and they usually have pretty decent music to dance to.You can't argue over the view, and dining al fresco on a warm Madison evening is top notch. However, you can argue over the totally boring and uninspired food offerings. At least they have a great wine list!

Crab cakes were the best bite of the evening - little filler if any, just nice, meaty crab.

The flatbread (asparagus, new potatoes, carrots, arugula pesto) would have been great if it didn't taste like it was on a store-bought flat bread sold at Woodman's. There was no crunch, no char, no nothing! What? The toppings were fresh, but throw me some salt and we'll talk. 

The tuna salad entree (sort of a take on a nicoise) was fine. I really don't have much to say.

The kicker was the dessert .. a chocolate torte with raspberry sorbet and two globs of honeycomb. Imagine a brownie, with the sweetest sorbet ever, and honeycomb that gets stuck in your teeth and isn't worth it. We ate two bites and decided to stop...that's also when our server decided to stop visiting our table. A whopping 20 minutes past before we saw her even come outside again. Not to mention the wine that was ordered, which we canceled since dessert was out and...the wine wasn't.  Service started off great, but quickly declined when an 8 top came into our servers section and she was off doting on them and ignoring the lower tabs. 

Go here for al fresco dining and a glass of wine. Then go somewhere else to eat. I don't understand all of these 4 and 5 stars!Bithchy Hostess should have been the warning to stay away this is for sure a chicks place to eat small portions of food with high prices. Mac and Cheese with lobster is ok meatballs ok Just not enough ever served.The past month all I was dreaming about was having a delicious burger and some foie. Since its banned in California, I thought Fleur by Huber Keller would be the best selection. This all stemmed from seeing Hubert Keller on Bizarre Foods making one and it's looked so juicy and delicious!! 

Unfortunately mine didn't look so great. Underneath all the sliced truffles was a hidden piece of foie gras, the total opposite of what I've seen advertised around portraying the famous Fleur burger. I Somewhat felt cheated. Was it worth $70? I'd strongly have to say no. But  hey, it's Vegas, we came to gamble!

On the other hand, my wife's potato crusted flounder was great and unique. 

We also had the prosciutto flatbread and that, in my opinion, wasn't up to Hubert Keller's standards. 

Service exceeded our expectations and the server was quite helpful in picking out a wine to compliment our meal.i don't drink, so this is a review purely on the food.  i had the blue crab cake hoagie (which is like a BLT with crab cakes).  bad idea!  it was the worst crab cake in the world, and it wasn't fresh!  it tasted like it was canned crab (which was probably what it was) that was sitting out too long in the heat for days.  it also had carrot chunks in it... what?
i had an order of the sweet potato fries, and it was nice that they drizzle honey on it, but not nice that it was over-fried and burnt.I'm so sorry to give them 2 stars! But, alas, I had to do it.  This isn't about the service (which is great) or the location (location, location). Their onions penetrate every facet of the menu.  Everything! I just can't stomach it anymore, even after visiting 3-4 times.  some of my friends even work here! Anyway, don't come here if you don't like onions or sitting one foot away from the next table.Food is good, price is reasonable for a restaurant in casino, SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!!! We waited 15 mins for someone to take our orders and another 20 mins for the food to be on our table. The server had an attitude when I asked her for a to go box and refills on the coffee.Just moved to Vegas and heard great things about this place. Went for the first time and they offered a delicious banana nut muffin, complimentary, since it was our first time! It was great. 
Our food, however, was not. The server said our potatoes were fresh, but they didn't taste nor look fresh. They put wayyyy too much cheese on everything and it completely covered up the taste of everything else. So we decided to give it another try.
Came back on a Saturday morning, had the banana nut muffin that tasted stale, again, way too much cheese and our food took forever! I don't know why I thought this place would use fresher ingredients... Definitely disappointing.Food wasn't terrible but it wasn't the best. What made the experience not so great was the service. Seemed like splitting a check due to business requirements for me set my server off and she was rude the remainder of my visit. It was super busy, so service was slow.Hubby and I tried Fogo last night for my birthday. For the money, I would rather have gone to a place like Circa 1900. The salad bar was at least not a typical Sweet Tomatoes-esque affair, with egg, potato, shrimp and chicken (and many more) salads, potato lasagna, marinated mushrooms, King crab legs, and crab rangoons. Then the meats started coming fast and furious. The turkey was clearly processed, the chicken drumstick was over-seasoned and dry, the filet mignon was over-cooked and tasted like organ meat, the pork loin was quite dry, and the sausage was tough and gristle-y. My favorite was the sirloin by far. Hubby enjoyed it all more than I did, even though I am usually the bigger carnivore. The service was good, except they were constantly trying to up-sell with drinks ($7 a piece) and dessert which were not included in the $29.95 basic meal. I got a hat on my head and a ball of fudge with a candle in it for my birthday dessert. The grand total, with an appropriate tip, was $95- not worth the indigestion for the rest of the night. You can do much better than Fogo for a special night out.On Sun/9 Jun at about 9 pm I was here with 2 buddies, and the 2 kids of one of the buddies:

Cons:
- $10 for "Field Greens, Tomatoes, and Fresh Herbs" salad which turned out to be a pitiful looking plate of iceberg lettuce and two cherry tomatoes that were cut in half.   My salad contained no herbs other than what was in the vinaigrette dressing I had on the side.  Capital Grille should rename it the "Iceberg Lettuce and Tomatoes" salad.  
- My 2 buddies had each ordered soup with their fish entrees.  Both buddies said that the waiter had made it seem that the $11/soup would be complimentary (since it was our first time eating at Capital Grille or whatever).  I wasn't paying attention to what the waiter said when he was discussing the menu, but I'll side with both of my friends (word of my 2 friends vs. the word of 1 waiter) who say they were mislead into ordering the soup.  Had my friends known it wasn't complimentary, they wouldn't have bothered ordering the soup.

Pros:
- Great location overlooking the northern end of the Strip.
- Aside from the soup problem, the service was great.
- Fancy decor, nice ambiance.A definite 1.5 star buffets but the service here was better than other buffets so I rounded up to 3 stars.

I think the best dish here was the fried chicken. The meat lasagna was meatless. The Caesar dressing was flavorless. I couldn't taste any mushroom in the mushroom ravioli.

Hmmm...don't know why I'm trying to remember everything I ate. You just need to know that you could get better food elsewhere for less if you're willing to walk.Average - expected more.  Not much flavor.  Service was pretty good.The staff at the store and bakery is simply delightful, and the place/food are great. I had a light breakfast there one morning, so I was excited about having dinner at the Pizzeria three nights later. Here's how the hostess, after rolling her eyes and sighing, greeted me: "You know, you COULD sit at the bar. Then I won't have to seat you." Um...no. I left, and won't be back there. But I WILL continue to patronize the store.Went here for the first time last weekend and it was really nice. I would say it is more of a nice restaurant than a cafe, but none the less, it was nice. I went there for lunch/brunch and the line didn't take too long. The food was all very good, the wait time wasn't too bad, and the prices were less than I expected for the Bellagio. I am not sure how dinner goes, but breakfast/lunch prices aren't bad.

My only problem with the place was that the servers aren't very friendly or helpful...at all. They somewhat ignore you, none of them smile, and while she was taking our order, she kept looking around elsewhere and making inside jokes with other passing by staff members. Very unprofessional servers. I've had better servers at IHOP. At least the food made up for it. Their eggs benny, bbq pulled pork sandwiches, and drinks were tasty!

If you are looking for a good place to eat for a relatively good price and can deal with not so smiley servers, then this is the place to go!We met up in Vegas with cousins of ours whose son travels frequently to Vegas on business. He recommended this restaurant, which is a block away from the Fremont Street Experience (see my review of that as well). The steaks were huge but even so, it was a little pricey for being off the strip. The service was average and the décor wasn't anything special and pretty plain (all deep brown wood which might appeal to some). I had the petite New York, which wasn't very petite and my husband had the ribeye, which he claimed was "good for a ribeye," whatever that means. I usually douse my steak in A1 but it sat untouched throughout my meal. I left wishing we had tried a different steakhouse. Measly servings of wine as well, but you're still overcharged for a full glass. Other than that, nothing much to write home about for this one. Wouldn't go back if we came to Vegas again.This is so not worth the hefty price! We went on Sat evening and it was $45 each, plus tax and tip. 
We love lobster, so that's why we went. They only had one lobster dish. It was a tray of tiny lobster tails and huge shrimp mixed together. The shrimp and the lobster were over cooked. It's "budget lobster" at a steep price. 
The dining room is severely boring and outdated. The staff is very friendly!!Seriously? People giving this place 5 stars? I have lived in Southern CA and now in El Paso, TX. I've tried some of the best mexican food, but this place was just ok. I've eaten "New Mexico" food in New Mexico and it's tasted better than this place. The food was a bit greasy. Granted, we ordered take-out from this place so maybe the food could have been better if we ate it in the very tiny restaurant that doesn't even have a sign on the outside. It's amazing how people even find this place!One word:  Overrated.  I like this as a convenient and un-chained place, but the coffee is only so-so and I've had some pretty awful iced teas here.  Some teas are just not good in iced form.  They should learn this and stop making iced tea out of whichever one it is that tastes like chemicals.  Also, while the vegetarian and vegan food selections are admirable, they aren't that good and are overpriced.  All of that said, I reliably run in to people I know while I am here, so that's nice.  And the lighting really does it for me.  I'm a fan of particular arrangements of lighting for particular moods.  Also, I didn't even know it had a name separate from "Frame Shop" (the framing shop next door) until two years after I moved here... and I walk by almost every day.Was here a few times. Fun to walk around and see some of the crazy stuff. The novelty wore off the second visit. Have yet to buy anything that is actually good. Bought a chocolate bar that wasn't sweet. Who makes chocolate that isn't sweet? The store was very disorganized. Seemed to be no order to anything. If you haven't been there, go check it out for yourself. Could be a fun experience.guys wearing sports jerseys, beaters, and baseball caps on backwards yelling "YEEEAH!", etc.... oh Lord, save me... WHAT was I thinking allowing the hubby to talk me into lunch here on a lovely summer afternoon??? OK,OK, I admit I found my self thinking that my reaction was a bit snobby (maybe it's my age....?) but yuck, who wants to yell over the televisions to talk to the person next to you?? I'm tellin' ya, they are loud. 

Food-wise, I should have stuck to typical bar food and maybe I would have had better luck, because the big pretzel was tasty; traditional chewy with coarse salt. The salad with tri-tips was a dissappointment...actually the salad part was fine - fresh romaine and avocado, but the tri-tip was dry and tough and the balsamic dressing on the side was an overly-sweet, gelatinous blob (truly weird). As the hubby pointed out, what was I thinking ordering salad at a sports bar?? 

If you are really looking to watch TV sports and drink beer... I guess this place would be fine. For LUNCH...waaaay better choices out here.No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.  

She started to guess, FFS.

Not cool.Come here if you prefer quantity over quality and style over substance.

Bonus star for Bjork autographed menu on display.The view is nice.  Food was terrible.  When we called they made a point to tell us there was a dress code, so we dressed for the occasion.  The bar above us had locals in concert t-shirts and flip flops hanging over the railing above us.  $200 for dinner and the food was really bad.  Not worth the price or the effort getting dressed up.Started off with waiting farrr to long to be able to order a drink. Finally got the drink and I swear it had not a drop of alcohol in it. Actually had to buy shots to put in the drink. Cool looking place  but the servers look like they should maybe work at a Denny's.  Bland burgers with bland fries. Best part of my meal was the Diet Coke.What it lacks in ambience it fails to make up for in service or food. Guy from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives correctly identified this as a dive; however, any redeeming or endearing qualities he saw substantially escape me.Went Way downhill in last few yrs I guess.  Crappy server...mediocre food and beverages for too much money.   Too bad...we need more decent restaurants on the west sideWe were inside the restaurant on a Friday night. All the action was on the patio, with girls screaming every several minutes or so over the loud beats. The interior was dead when we arrived, save for 2-3 guys hanging out at the bar. We ordered thai iced coffee to start, which was good, but not phenomenal. 

The interior is nice, with brick walls and well executed decorations. The bar is off the side from the main dining area, with the exit to the patio and bathrooms located on the opposite end from where we were seated. The party outside was really loud, and the music was even louder. They were playing largely hip hop and my boyfriend really didn't enjoy listening to it while trying to eat.

For food, we ordered the Buddha fresh spring roll, an order of the combo satay and the spicy red curry to finish. Our appetizers came out quickly, but not long after that that point another large group came in and they dominated the restaurant's attentions for the remainder of the evening. 

Our curry took at least 15, if not 20, minutes to come out while we sat and finished our coffees, our appetizers, and just sat there trying in vain to communicate over the really loud music. Our waitress had time to count her tips and chat with one of the other waitresses before everyone was distracted for the next 20 minutes. We ordered a Singha, which was forgotten, so after waiting a while we got it from another server who was rushing around.  We watched as a table of "invisible customers" a few seats down from us was filled with multiple different steaming plates of food while we were waiting on our curry. Eventually 2 people sat there, one who looked like they were probably the owner and the other his friend. The owner-looking fellow talked to the other group in the room & the waitstaff while ignoring us as we sat there unhappy.  

The Food:
The Buddha Fresh Spring roll was medicore. Small bites of shrimp with tons and tons of cabbage. No real texture interest, no real flavor of any kind- just lots of raw cabbage and chewy rice paper. Served with a really sticky, peanut-laced sauce. 

The Satay were better. Several skewers of different types of meat, they were still tender and slid off the sticks easily enough to avoid puncturing yourself.

After waiting so long, the curry didn't really satisfy us. It was definitely spicy, but didn't have much going on in the background. It was all heat in the beginning and wimper at the end. I liked the vibrant red color of it and the fresh herbs, but otherwise it was just OK. There wasn't a strong coconut flavor to it, which disappointed J quite a bit. We had been expecting more of a traditional thai style curry, while I'm guessing this may have been more Malaysian. I ate mine because I was hungry but J left his unfinished. 
We had it with the coconut rice, which helped bring some coconut flavor to the picture, but not a ton. It was moist rice, but a small portion- roughly an upturned bowl for us to share. It was definitely not enough for the entire bowl and all the sauce.  

When we were about to go, we asked to have all of our food boxed up. Our waitress disappeared with the food and then returned to go chat with the other customers. We stood around waiting until she was finished, but when that took too long, we asked another server where our food was. She'd thrown it away. Oh, thanks! It was easily half the meal still. I'm assuming she couldn't hear me because the music was SO loud!  We got another batch made up quickly, which made up for it- but also made us wonder why it took so long the first time. 

I don't like yelling over the music while trying to enjoy a nice meal out, nor do I enjoy being blatantly ignored or given biased treatment while out to eat. It's understandable to me that there's more motivation to kiss up to the large groups because of the higher chance of a good tip, but you never know in this town who'll be the best tipper. 

Overall- you're paying for atmosphere. Go at happy hour, grub out and drink some tasty sounding drinks. Don't go after midnight for food unless you're going to be partying on the patio or with a large enough group for them to really care.Mandalay Bay Hotel has been one of my long time favourite casinos to stay at in Las Vegas.  The rooms are nice, the casino is clean and relatively smoke-free, and the restaurants are all good; or, at least that is what I used to think.

The Bayside Buffet does NOT stand up to the reputation of the Mandalay Bay experience.  For a group of twenty-one people, they required an eighteen percent gratuity to seat the party together.  However, we were not seated together.  They were going to seat us in one of the main rooms spread out over six tables.  Mind you, we arrived early enough that they only had maybe three other parties in the restaurant.  When we complained, they refused to even push some of the tables together; we pushed them together, to consolidate the group into four separate tables.  That was the best that we could manage.

The service was slow.  And, mind you, this was a buffet.  So, slow service was kind of puzzling.  All they had to do was provide us with drinks, at an almost empty buffet. 

And the food, well I guess that's what we get for going so early.  It tasted like they served us yesterday's food.  A lot of it was hard and chewy, stale.  And avoid the weekend omlette cook, he could only manage two omlettes at a time, barely.

The Bayside Buffet service belongs at someplace like the Tropicana.Yeah, um, no. Just don't. Read my quick tip if you can. And if you're interested in that kind of thing, go for it. Otherwise, do not wait in any line or pay any cash to enter this place. Just don't.I went here with some friends who state that this is one of their favorite restaurants in Vegas, so I was really looking forward to trying some delicious Italian food!  I wasn't impressed with my meal, unfortunately, and maybe it was due to the food I ordered.  After being meat-ed out from a steakhouse visit the prior night, I was in the mood for seafood, so I ordered a house salad and a mussel special of the night.  The $15 house salad was a huge platter of basically iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and fennel.  I should have ordered the beet salad as my friend did.  The entrees came out on a cart and are served table-side which is a nice touch.  My $35 special was some spaghetti with an average tomato sauce and mussels, some of which were still sandy.  I was not impressed.  However, I tried one of my friends meat balls and those were very good.  I don't mind paying for a good meal but the food at least has to be good.  Too many other options in Vegas... I won't be back.The food was so incredibly subpar and average. In general I'd give a place like this a 3, but the service definitely warranted takes another star away...

Once we placed our "cheapo" order (we only spent $150 between the 2 of us.. wow we are such cheapskates), the waiter gave us a rude look and disappeared for the night. He literally never came back. Our baked potato was served without any toppings, our water was never refilled.. it was awful. We literally had to hunt someone down 15 minutes after our potato was delivered to ask for some butter and sour cream. UGH. 

The worst part was we had a $25 giftcard as part of a package at Red Rock. They took the card, and then the next day when we went to check out, we saw they had made their tip on a $150 meal over $50... they had just applied the gift card to their tip. Are you kidding me? It took waayyyy too much fighting and hassle to get our $25 back. The front desk was rude, didn't believe us, etc, etc.. What a pain!

Overall there are sooo many places in Vegas to eat an average steak (like Hugo's for instance), you might as well eat at one with good service too! If you want an amazing jaw dropping steak, there are plenty of places for that as well (Craftsteak, Strip Steak, etc, etc). Why settle for an average steak in a crappy place? What's the point?We love to try new steak houses in Vegas and this one was a serious disappointment. There is nothing special about the ambiance or location. The food is good, but I have had similar meals at other steak houses for significantly less money. The service was fine, but again nothing special to entail the steep price. Their wine prices alone were significantly higher than similar establishments.  I would go to just about any other steak place on the strip before I would bother going back here.Great place. Their house shots are unique.  Lunch menu is good. And it's unusual to say a tuna sandwich is amazing, but it really was. You should try it. But the greatest thing is that the service is great!  And props to the new owner,(forgot his name),  who checked up on our meal. And props to the cool, pink arm-casted, bartender who played some really chill music.

Update: since we had such a great experience the first few times we kept coming back. Unfortunately, the subsequent times we went we did not have such a great experience. Between the bad music (random as fuck pandora stations), inexperienced bartenders(what's in a mojito), dead atmosphere, and expensive drinks I don't think We will be giving this place another chance to get back in our good graces.A sports bar in Scottsdale you assume would have a little of that Scottsdale flair right? A little style, a little pizzazz, even with a rougher edge for those who don't fully embrace the Scottsdale flavor!!?!

No!
No it doesn't. 
What it is, is a water hole for those drunkards that happens to walk by. A pit stop during a switch in bars, or clubs.. because nobody in their right mind decides to go out, go all the way to Scottsdale and go to THIS place. That plainly doesn't happen. 

Someone mentioned a smell.. I thought that was my memory serving me wrong, but that is a thing I do remember too. They need to gut this place a replace it with something that is worthy of the location it is in.

Yes, they hire cute girls.. so what, who doesn't?!If I have a bad expweiwnce in a place I usually give the place a second chance and that is the case with the GRand Cafe at Green Valley Ranch.
I came one rime a couple of weeks ago and service was horrible. 
2 weeks after previous experien (and different hour) I came to eat here again. Sat at the bar, bartender looked at me anf he walked away....no menu, no drink, not even a "Hi". I waited for 10 more minutes when he finally came out and look at me again.....and nothing. He went back to the back. 
I went to the hostess and asked for a table.... I was seated quickly but my waiter was MIA for 10 minutes... I ordered my meal .and he got it conpletly wrong. Also he served he cold coffe and the water I asked at the beggining of my meal i got it when I was signing the check.
I dont know what is going on with this place but the service ia horrible. It seems like the pwoplw who work here at very unhappy or they just dont care.
My advice......eat here only if you have an hour to kill otherwise move along.
Food still decent.This place is not that great but it delivers so I have ordered from here a few times. 

The pad see ew is pretty good.  I also like the pinapple fried rice - it's well spiced but not over spiced.  

I've gotten the panang curry a few times and it has been hit or miss ranging from decent to bad - sometimes its just overloaded with sugar.  The tom ka gai is ok but there are large pieces of galangal and ginger that you need to pick out every bite.

My fav Thai in town is Lotus of Siam ( http://tinyurl.com/l8hr9w ) , and if I don't feel like driving clear across town, Archi's or PIn Kao are decent enough.During a time which seems so long ago, this was the "it" place for movies.  After going tonight, it now seems old and dirty - a sharp contrast to memory.  Tickets are higher in price than Harkins, and "large" size popcorn and drinks (at Harkins) get one free refill.  From what I understand, nothing is free at AMC unless you first spend $ to purchase some kind of card.  Emphasis on the word "spend.".  Both the movie and sound quality were good.  The strange thing is the theatre became noticeably warm (hot) midway through the movie.  The problem was corrected.Umm I can't see what the fuss is about in the other reviews.  Our server was mediocre, passing by our empty glasses, and food was just, meh. I had chicken soup that tasted like enchilliata sauce. The Caesar salad was big and in a big bowl-nothing special. 

I agree with Justin from Dallas.  Anyone from out of town, keep looking.we decided to go to vegas with the kids and hit the red rock! unfortuanately, the food was terrible. we ate the hachi one night and LBS another, both times we found hair in the food. the food court ended up the best. wifi was terrible!!!...the pool was great and we used the hard cabanas which were great. but the food was less than good and the casino with poor ventilation. no where to go with kids other than bowling and only one movie that was PG...so not optimal with younger children. we did get a suite with connecting room and it was large and comfortable. but that doesn't make up for the terrible food.Don't come here for restaurant week, overpriced menu for the food you get. Tried all 3 main dishes and they were all bland, needed to add lots of salt. Service was excellent on the plus side.I remember when they first opened years ago and I liked this place. They've expanded and remodeled the place. Along with that was a decline in the quality of their food. My friend and I shared a medium half everything, half pepperoni pizza and rainbow cookies. 

Pizza:
What the heck happened to their crust? It was like eating a cracker - pale and flavorless. What the heck happened to the pizza? It's just not as good as the last time I've been here. I had to fix it by dousing it with hot sauce. 2/5

Rainbow Cookies:
When I think of rainbows, I think happy thoughts. I tried their rainbow cookies and I was hoping my trip to New York was soon enough so I can get the real deal. This brought me great disappointment. It was dry and tasted so artificial. Never again will I try rainbow cookies from this town if it's not from Bagel Cafe. 1/5Ok atmosphere. Ok service. Terrible food. Great beer on tap. Overall, really below average food for the area. Everything is deep fried and fatty but tasteless. Not rushing back... Unless I'm only thirsty and it's happy hour.Eh. This used to be my go to Korean food restaurant. I ordered a pick up order today, the pork tofu soup (soon du bu) and a order of Kalbi. I was so shocked first by the price! Haven't been here in a while but I am pretty sure that the prices definitely have gone up in the past year. Not appetizing. Secondly, my soup was not as delicious as I remembered. There was no flavor! Also felt like i got a smaller portion than usual. Completely disappointing and I don't think I'll be back. I have VERY high standards on Korean food and this was far from it. There are so many other places out there that I will now be looking for a new Korean restaurant. This used to be good, ain't horrible but I've had better.This isn't the place to take your girl on a romantic first date, but if you've been together a few years and your SO is dying to see some specific movie that came out 2 months ago- I'll give you the thumbs up.

This would be a solid 4-star establishment, except for the following..

CONS:
Too many young children allowed to talk through the film.
(Really, why are you bringing your infant and toddler to Bad Grandpa, anyway?)
Prices are constantly increasing, which means value is decreasing.
($2 per ticket, it was $5.50 for a small popcorn, $5.00 for a large soda- prices are on par or more expensive than traditional theaters)
Establishment isn't maintained well; restrooms, seating and flooring all could use a little work.

I can overlook that this place isn't located in the greatest part of town, I can overlook that the bathrooms are a little dirty, I can overlook that people bring their kids- the cheap tickets have become less of a value.I went here the other night with a party of 6.  As we walked up to the front door, we walked through an outside bar area that was playing live music.  If we didn't have under 21 year olds with us, we probably would have sat outside.  So we proceeded to go in and were greeted by an empty hostess station.  We continued to walk passed the station and were finally greeted by somebody and we told her we were there with a party of 6 for dinner.  She quickly told us we could sit in the dining area, the area ahead of us, or the bar area.  My husband told her we'd like to sit in the bar area and she then tells us that it's closed.  OK, so why did she tell us we could sit in there to begin with?  We chose not to sit in the bar because of the under age that were with us.  So we pushed two tables together and there we were.  A waitress comes around to take our drink orders.  So we were actually talking to somebody that had no personality whatsoever.  She leaves and a good amount of time goes by before we actually get our drinks.  Then it's time to order dinner.  Holy smokes, if that wasn't something else too.  Again, no customer interaction it was like talking to a robot.  Orders were placed and basically that was it.  We never saw her again until food was coming out.  Even my daughter was commenting on how terrible the service was.  And prices are $10.00 easy per person.   What brought us in was a Groupon.  It was worth paying the $15.00 to get $30.00 worth of food.  But honestly, because of the poor service, I don't know if I'll go back again.  As far as the food goes, it wasn't too bad.  I ended up getting the Freedom Dip which is their version of the French Dip.  The kids got burgers and sliders and my husband ended up with the Club sandwich.  I was very impressed with his choice.  As I now read other Yelpers comments, I see that my service issue is a constant there.  Too bad I didn't see them before.  Probably would have made me not come here.  Sorry Iguana Mack's.  But it's going to be awhile before I come back.Got here and every movie is sold out even if seats available.  Make sure to choose your seats or you end up in the front row!!!  Favorite theatre but sucks last two times.This was, by far, the worst meal we had while in Las Vegas...especially disappointing since it was also, by far, the most expensive meal we had while in Las Vegas. 

We just had a little time for dinner before a show, and the concierge suggested this place since we had no reservations. It was horridly overpriced, and the food mediocre at best. 

The service was, however, outstanding...sorta. They brought a piece of bread before the meal, and never offered another, until we chased the server down and asked. Not cool.

We split the grilled octopus appetizer. The octopus was cooked perfectly, but sauced with an extremely strong balsamic glaze that completely obscured the flavor of the fish. We both ordered the short rib with polenta dinners. The meat was overcooked to the point that it became mush as soon as we started to chew it. The polenta was excellent...both tablespoons of it. The "dinner" portion would have been an appetizer anywhere else. This meal was thoroughly disappointing, especially at $36 a pop.

The wine, at $22 a glass, was no better than the wine they bring for free if you just stick a dollar bill in the penny slots. 

Mario, if you're paying attention: You can do a lot better than this!If eating food counted towards your gambling debt than this place should be considered part of your losses. In fact this place is a total loss, a "bad beat". 

I had a beef stew over rice, which came out quickly but it wasn't anything special. Brother had a pad thai dish which he said that he's had better.

The place is over priced for average food, but I can't complain about the price, it's Vegas.What was supposed to be a wonderful drive through Red Rock Canyon was an industrial drive to Lake Mead.  The actual drive in Lake Mead was okay.  Again,  it was not Red Rock Canyon.  We asked the shuttle driver afterwards why we didn't go to Red Rock like we were supposed to.  He stated that the website hadn't been updated.  Another woman in the van said she had called last week and was also told it was a tour through Red Rock so apparently they lie.  It was fun driving the cars but half of the experience was supposed to be doing it in Red Rock Canyon.  The fact that they sell it as one thing but produce another makes me question them.  Everyone was nice but extremely misleading.  Overall a waste of time and money.I'm torn! I should give this place 1* but gonna give it 2 instead. The first time I ate here was for lunch. I had one of their lunch specials - shrimp in lobster sauce or something like that and the BF ordered crispy chicken without whatever sauce they slather over it. All was mediocre. The servers were nice & friendly and the space was clean. I really wanted to like this place. It was close to home and finding a conveniently good chinese place is a heaven sent. Not too long ago I got sick. I was craving for a nice bowl of Wor WonTon soup. I called in the order for two people (not for the BF but thinking of the next day -- so selfish!). The BF picked it up on his way back from the gym. I was extremely excited to dive in this "broth of life".  It was far from bringing me back to life. The broth was flavorless! I could do hellah better with packaged ramen!! There were... hmmm... let's see... all of two wontons in the whole soup. Glad the order was for two: 1 wonton for today, 1 for tomorrow! Also, I swirled my spoon 'round'n'round and  around again looking for some crustaceous morsels. I thought out loud to the BF that shrimp should come in the soup. For 9 buckaroos, he said it better comes in a school of 'em. (does "school" applies only to fish?) Anyhow, they did their math correctly though - there's 1 shrimp to go with the 1 wonton for today and the other shrimp to go with the wonton tomorrow. BTW, I'm a queen of doctorin'up flavorless dishes, but this bowl of soup was a loss cause. I'm still trying to recover from my flu. Go figure!Not a fan of the phone you have to pick up to order your food. Had to go wash my hands before the food came out. Dog was OK. Milkshake was average.So, my husband ventured out last night to pick up dinner for the family.  I told him I was craving mexican and so he decided to come home with Cafe Rio.

He got one barbacoa burrito, one chicken burrito and a side order of chips (which he put some cheese sauce on).  These were the biggest burritos I have ever seen... not sure exactly what he paid for them but they weren't the best I've had.  The barbacoa was really sweet like they simmered it in sugar and the chicken was really dry.  If it wasn't for the guacamole and the salsa I put on it there was no way I could have eaten it.

It was good and maybe we will go back, but we will definetly try something else next time.I wasn't too thrilled with this place for two reasons. First, I went to the restroom before I ordered and saw an employee walk out without washing her hands. I'm sure this happens at restaurants everywhere but to see it was a turnoff.

Second, I didn't like the way the workers yelled out "mooorre meat!" whenever someone ordered extra meat. It was hard to enjoy a meal and talk to my friends with people yelling that the whole time.

The food was pretty decent, nothing to rave about. I also ordered the pork barbacoa salad based on the comments of many here, but found the pork too sweet for my taste. The sweetness was countered nicely by the vinaigrette dressing, however.

I think there are better places to go in the area. So I'll try them out and hope I don't hear "mooooorre meat!" in my head for the next few days.I have stopped in to the AZ Bread Co before for a quick breakfast--some toast and coffee, or their acceptable French toast. Nothing special. I was running errands in the neighborhood and came in for lunch. I ordered the carne adovada sandwich at peak lunch time, about 12:15. It's a big sandwich on a French roll and it was just plain bad. The roll was microwaved and tough, chewy. I mean, you put the word 'bread' in the title of your restaurant. Yikes. The meat was over stewed and over salted by a long shot. The only other component of the sandwich is an equally salty and processed-tasting liquid cheese sauce. Nothing fresh on the sandwich at all? I was starving but couldn't bring myself to eat any more of it. I took it home to my husband because he has a deep, abiding love for any sort of slow cooked pork dish and even he wouldn't take more than a bite. They need to take a look at the dishes they're serving and inject some life into them. It should be better--and it wouldn't be hard to improve.The reviews are pretty accurate in my opinion. We have received poor service from them. Their service is inconsistent. At times they are great and at other times, they were there for 5 minutes and left. They promise to provide all of these service with each cleaning and in our experience, they have not done so. I can't recall the last time I saw them brush the sides of our pool. They don't always empty every basket. And I've never seen them vacuum the pool floor. And we paid for their highest level of service. We've called to complain about their techs being not thorough and they were rather defensive and didn't apologize or see what they could do to improve service. Overall, this is the attitude they seem to embrace. Rather than put the customer first, they get defensive. There have been other problems. For example, they stopped providing service on two separate occasions. In my opinion, their front office is disorganized. On two different occasions, they stopped providing service due to problems with their front office. On one occassion, they lost our billing information and another, they forgot to put us on their schedule.STILL haven't heard from manager Kevin.  Will keep experience short.  Planned a surprise party for friend, we all work in the area.   34 RSVPd and 42 showed.   I got there early to decorate, 6/30 event date.  That night's manager greeted me and gave me choice of area.  Tables were set for 6 but only fit 4 comfortably.  Eyes rolled when I mentioned this, was told these were designated for us.  When more showed up, as often happens, better more, than less, I was told we could not overflow to empty tables.  Are you kidding me! Treat them as walk-ins and take their order.   One waitress commented, "That's why I hate working these events."    I thought the objective was to work for tips with good service.  When one person finally got waitresses attention, "You want another one ?"(beer) she'd had only one.  I could go on and on, but don't want to get irritated again.  AND an 18% gratuity was was added to everyone's bill. Many had to wait unreasonably long for food and service and felt gratuity too much.  I never sat down as I was trying to keep folks calm and happy.  The food was fair, nothing special.  I plan work gatherings often in the area, last one here.   Many of the guests live nearby and said they would not return.   South Phx. has many choices now, will book with them.  I called Kevin several times prior to event to make sure all was in order.  I've yet to hear back from him after event.  I've even emailed him on website saying, perhaps he'd like to call for feedback before I Yelped.   Crickets.    May be okay for a group of 4, not able to handle a large group.   Bartender started waiting tables and was very rude.   Need a steak house?   I've used Rustler's Rooste for 45 and have only compliments.   Yeah, my event was T-Boned, crashed with Terrible service.     
Update 7/12.  Kevin called me yesterday to see why I was not happy.   I reiterated issues.   He said if others were unhappy they would have called.   I explained I told guests I'd handle the feedback.  Basically, he called me a liar.   He IS now getting calls from customers.  Arrogant manager!    This is the first time I've had someone so rude in a manager position and I host lots of events. Their loss.Yuck!
Typical and dirty, rude and greasy. If you want takeout go to Hong Kong Kitchen a mile down the street. They have lunch specials too with only half the grease and about the same price.Like every other Harbor Freight store, they're loaded with cheap Chinese crap tools, with a few gems in the mix.  I've been going here on and off for years to load up on things like nitrile and mechanics gloves (I love their leather palm version, much more so than the real mechanics gloves).  Occasionally I've found tooling that is made in Germany, or Spain, and is of very good quality.  Still not quite professional/industrial grade (and I mean actual industrial, not someone slapping "Industrial" into the name of an otherwise cruddy product), but quite good for home use.  

But lately the service side has been getting worse and worse, especially when checking out.  This morning I got to stand in line for nearly 30 minutes before getting frustrated, tossing my arm full of stuff on a display, and walking out.  There was one register open, about a dozen customers in the store, ten of which were standing in line.  The cashier needed a void, which needed a manager code.  Took five minutes to get a manager up there.  30 seconds later she needed to break a hundred.  Yep, another five minutes for the manager.  Next customer questioned a coupon, and wanted to speak to a manager...yay.  Every time a manager needed to be summoned, all transactions came to a halt.  Every time the manager came, he gives change or keys in a code and instantly disappears.  

This was the proverbial last straw....I've gotten used to waiting in line 10 or 15 minutes when they're busy, and the lines are long on 3 of the 4 registers, but 30 mins on one single line early on a Saturday morning?  That was also 30 minutes of waiting, and there were still a couple customers ahead of me...who knows how long it would have been before I actually got to a register...

Do they really only have one person capable of running a register? 

Is the stuff cheap?  Sure.  But considering nearly everyone sells cheap Chinese tools now, the savings are typically only a few bucks here and there, and frankly not worth the frustration to me.I was excited to see a new little sushi spot in the area. The sushi was pretty good, and the drinks were good. (you can't go wrong with that) The service was horribly lacking. To think that at such a small restaurant and three servers can't handle a handful of tables, shows that management must be lacking as well. My servers name was Bebe, I think. She seemed like she was having a bad day, I could see it written all over her face. So that attitude portrayed through her service. I asked for two refills of my hot tea (the cups were pretty small) and she rolled her eyes and started gossiping to another server about it. Geez, did I do something wrong? I would think not!
The sushi chefs were friendly at the least, and the sushi wasn't the best i've had, but good.  i had the valentine roll, nothing too special but good. My favorite was the spider roll, and the yellowtail sashimi.. Those were pretty good as well. The prices are not too expensive and very competitive at least.
I would give this place 3 stars but because of the lack or service, I gave it 2 stars. My favorite place till this day is Hiro sushi...The drinks are crap most of the time. Watered down. The food always makes me sick. The service is alright, but usually they're not paying attention to what they are doing because they're too busy socializing or watching TV.

Parking is a b-tch due to the market nearby. The lines are long and what you wait for isn't worth it.

Lollicup for me, thank you.Used to be much better but the quality has gone down recently. Drinks are chalky and way too sweet. Won't be returning any time soon.I gave the restaurant 2 stars. The food was good (great Hummus) but this restaurant was FILTHY. We were their first guests of the day! Floors dirty. display case filthy. Booths unwiped. Crap everywhere....This place was wonderful when I adopted my puppy and found out the next day that he had parvo.  The doctor gave me all the medicine and subcut fluids for FREE and he survived all thanks to her!
After that, though, this vet has been horrible.   I have been there many times as my puppy also has what turned out to be food allergies and I never got to see that first vet again.  The other vets I saw were completely incompetent and I wasted hundreds of dollars on pointless tests and medicines and prescription food.  When their final solution was to put him on disgusting Hill's I/D prescription diet ($300/month and not working at all) I had to walk out of this place and I will NEVER go back.  I went to Pet Club in Mesa and the first food she gave me completely fixed my dog's problems.  
I believe some of the doctors at VCA are good, but most are horrible.  I think in general the staff is more cat-savvy.
I would give this place one star but that first vet saved my dog's life!  So, THANK YOU to her, and two thumbs down to the place as a business.Ok. So.... Being a Latina and living in AZ all my life, I know some good Mexican food when I see it/eat it. This place USED to taste good a few years ago, Well not so much of good food this time from My husband and I's experience. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito wet, aka enchilada style. First off, I don't think the cashier understood too well, however, she was polite and seemed like she did, anyway, didn't get it wet when my order was served,  but they fixed it at "no charge". Long story short, my beans didn't have any flavor and didn't taste "fresh", the enchilada sauce tasted as if it was from a can, my husbands fish tacos were soggy, no flavor, and chewy (batter). The red and green Chili/salsa was good though...I had to pour it on my food to give it flavor. Overall I felt it was a waste of money. Very disappointed :-(Reuben sandwich w salad AND soup and all three totally bland! I'm sad that I didn't enjoy this place because I LOVE delis. Damn.Why do so many people think this is a good franchise? These are the most bland, disappointing burgers I've ever had from any chain. Let me document the three tries I've given it.

Strike 1-Burger with Swiss cheese, cheddar cheese, sauteed mushrooms and bacon. Sounds like an amazing burger, but it was just bland and greasy.

Strike 2-Bleu Ribbon burger with onion straws, blue cheese, and steak sauce. I didn't know anything with blue cheese on it could still be so boring. Yawn.

Strike 3-A vegetarian quesadilla and guacamole bacon burger. The quesadilla looked awesome, stuffed with mushrooms and whatnot, but I had to dip it in guac to give my tastebuds the slightest hint of satisfaction. They should stop using cheap, mild cheese and maybe actually season the stuff instead of giving your 4 different toppings for it. Also, the burger sucked. It doesn't matter if it says "Oregano seasoned patty" or "cayenne" or whatever--they all taste the same. Not to mention telling the waitress "well done" and getting meat with plenty of pink.

I want to give you 1 star so bad, but you try to be good, especially with the vegetarian substitutions available. I hope your patrons wake up and realize there are exponentially better burgers in several locations within walking distance.Worst drinks in the chain's west valley branches. Expect to spend about 15 min from in the door to out the door.This was our second time visiting Flo's.  We were not impressed.  We ordered the shrimp & snap peas with sauted vegetable and were completely under whelmed.  If you can describe anything less than bland, that would be it.

On a Wednesday night, the place was packed so I was so surprised when we sat down at our table with our to go order and felt I would have better served with Panda Express, which I hate by the way.

The spring rolls that I ordered (thinkin P.F. Chang's) were worse than I could have gotten at Costco for a total of $8 for 4.

I can't recommend it and we won't be back.I do not enjoy this hotel. First off when we went last summer, the room was wrong, they gave us a smoking room and a room with one King Bed, we asked for 2 queens. They did little to help us. It was extremely smoky in the actual hotel and the stench was unbearable. I love the spa. It gives the best stone massages in the whole world, they have a steam room, sauna, pool, jacuzzi, and a relaxation room. The showers are incredible, and they offer appetizing scrubs. The only thing that lures me into this hotel is the spa. Other than that its great for kids, pretty cheap, and they have a $1 hotdog stand by the bar.Hotel is clean. Food is poor. Except for the sushi bar which is very good. Avoid the cafe and the buffet. Of the three of us, two got sick. We went to the "the amazing meeting" which was amazing. Look it up. I just wish they would hold it at another hotel. South points pool is crammed full of children, all day. Not very relaxing.  On the the other hand this hotel is very reasonably priced. You get what you pay for i guess.Rude ass bartender - "Michelle" We came in exhausted and tired from work (so to her we probably look like we were broke lol. ) She first asked if we wanted something to drink but we asked to order food first. After she served our food she did not check back and after those hot wings we were thirsty, and needed some more water. Throat was on fire and we were slurping on ice! I turned around to ask another server and as the other server brought the water back around to us, Michelle states " OH! Now you want something?! " 
I was like " uh we've been needing some water." 
She says, "Well YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED!" 
(Oh hell nah! Who are we suppose to ask?! It's not even busy around here.) 

So, anyway she turns to the customers three seats away from us and has the nerve to talk crap about us in front of them!! 

WTF DID WE DO? We just needed some water. She continued with the side eye. So I'll leave her a nice "Tip" : NEXT TIME INSTEAD OF TURNING TO THE LEFT TO TALK SHIT, just be more attentive to your customers. 

Overall, food was BWW.
SERVER was a beeotch. LolWARNING!!! DO NOT ORDER THE CHEF'S OMAKASE MENU! 

My husband, cousin, and myself were staying at Caesar's Palace this past weekend and we were craving sushi. Since Sushi Roku was located inside the hotel, we decided that it would be convenient to go there. 

We decided to splurge a little and try the Chef's Omakase Menu ($90 per person). We were super excited. They even offered a complimentary glass of champagne which was so delicious.  

The meal started off strong. We were served a piece of halibut sashimi w/ shiso leaf & yuzu gelee, a piece of king crab w/ caviar, and a piece of seared toro with a piece of truffle on it. All three of us were in ahhhh. This alone deserves two stars. We immediately thought that if the first course was an indication of what was to come....we definitely were in for a treat.

Unfortunately...it was all down hill after wards. Our second course was a seared albacore salad. It was good, but nothing special. The third course was 4 pieces of red snapper sashimi (this was one of our least favorite dishes). The 4th course was a miso glazed halibut (so common). Then came the sushi course. I was expecting this  to be the best course, but it ended up being the worst. We were served Spicy Tuna Rolls topped with pieces of sashimi (kind of like a rainbow roll), and three pieces of sushi (toro, mackerel, and yellowtail). All of this was followed by a chocolate lava cake for the dessert. 

Our bill came out to $377 and it was a major disappointment. I've eaten at other Sushi Roku locations and they were good, but this meal just pissed me off. When someone orders an Omakase Menu....it pretty much represents what the restaurant has to offer. If I knew I was going to get Spicy Tuna Roll for $90, I would never had opted to splurge. 

Note: The rating that I give Sushi Roku is 2.5 stars. The half star is simply for the complimentary champagne that comes with the omakase menu.My husband and I enjoy bogo sandwiches and wraps Wednesday evenings. The food is always superb! I would give this review 5 stars if it was just based on food. The crab legs are fresh, sweet and juicy. Love the fries and buffalo chicken wrap. However the service here is horrible, if you're unfortunate enough to get one of the girl waitresses. Takes 10 min to even be greeted luckily by then you have already decided what to eat. The food is out pretty fast because the cook usually brings it. Then it takes 30 min to be able to pay and leave.. Anyway if you have extra time to wait and don't mind dinner taking two hours they have good food.My friend and I wanted to try a new place and didn't want to travel far from flamingo and 215 area. We enlisted Yelp to help us find a place to dine at. Shucks came to mind. After reading all the reviews this seemed to be THE place the be! so we decided to give it at shot. 

When you walk in you see is the bar, we looked for a hostess but there's a sign to seat yourself. On the right hand side is the bar with some high top tables to sit at and on the left there are tables and booths restaurant style. We decided to sit at a booth with a large table because we were planning on eating a lot of food. We were greeted by the waiter and he gave us some time to look at the menu. 

There is a pretty good selection of seafood and other items such as sandwiches and pasta to choose from. My friend and I went for the seafood. We ordered 1/2 a dozen raw oysters on the shell, 1/2 lb of black mussels, 1/2 lb of manila clams, 1 lb of snow crab legs, garlic french fries, and a crab and spinach dip. seasonings for the seafood we choose lemon and garlic. 

The food didn't take too long to come out except for our garlic fries. First, came the crab and spinach dip. Consistency was different than what I'm used to. It was a little runny and had a strong sea food taste from the crab. I'm used to this dip being a little thicker and more creamy.  We had to add some hot sauce, salt and pepper to the appetizer so it wouldn't taste as bland. The chips that came with it were almost a cross between a tortilla and a pita bread. 
Next came the oysters. Those were delicious. White meat not cloudy and didn't smell fishy. Then the rest of our food arrived.

 Everything smelled so GOOD and mouth watering but when we started slurping and eating everything our noses deceived us. The food smelled so tasty and aromatic but it did not taste the same way. Weird right? I guess we are so used to eating at Hot 'n' Juicy. We finished our meal and I totally didn't even notice that our garlic fries never came out. We flagged down the waiter and asked them if they forgot it? He went to check and said the cooks forgot but it seemed like he forgot to ring it in. 

The fries came out about 5 minutes later super oily and shiny with some sort of garlic white powder on top of them. I didn't even want to eat it. I tried one and the moment I bit into it I felt like an oil bubble bursted into my mouth.

This place is nice and clean but the service was a little poor. They only had 2 table sitting in that area with 2 servers serving as well.  The price is good for what you get especially since it is seafood. 

So if you are looking for something close in the area with mediocore seafood. This will be the spot.Friendly girl taking the order, boss in back asking her questions while she was trying to make my order. I guess he is more concerned about his work then his customers... Coffee was good but I was looking for a drive thru and there was none.Not a bad place to grab a drink if price is your concern. Food menu is slim and nothing was that good. We ordered:
sweet potato fries - good flavor, a bit limp, nice honey dip
onion rings - crispy, fried part fell off of the onions
spinach artichoke dip - liked the taste of it but there were HUGE artichoke chunks that were too big to eat

Popular place for karaoke, or at least it sounded like it.Staying at the Sunset Station, which by the way was much better than I had expected it to be.

Well Gus had some folks to meet for dinner and I was on my own. Figuring I would get something and take up to the room I walked around a couple of times and decided on Fatburger.

The young lady was quite personable with each who approached. She took my order of a burger with whatever it is they put on them and since the sign said the onion rings were the best you know one always believes signs I too had an order with a shake. And I wonder why I am a fat old man. 

It took very few minutes to get my order and off to the room I go. Well the burger was a mushy mess of no distinct tastes, I truly hated it and the onion rings were bland at best. The shake... ok.

It was mentioned that we should stop at a fatburger the other day and this memory popped up and I shuddered, never again...The service is soo slow, a pet peeve of mine on a weekday lunch hour. Lunch time servers need to be on their best because business people need to be in and out of restaurants to get back to work. A party of 10 took an hour and 45 minutes... that is too long for people needing to be in court and in front of a judge.

Food was good, but they carry Pepsi Products not Coke... just in case it matters, I asked if they had Coca-Cola and waitress said yes, served it to me and surprise it was not Coca-cola, it was pepsi.

Probably try it again.Not memorable.

We called ahead to see if they offered a tasting and we were told YES! So when we showed up at our reservation, the server said he'd have to check with the chef and said he thinks it was okay. 
Since I understood that tasting menus can be a pain if they are not offering it to the whole restaurant, we said it was not a problem and we'd just order off regular menu.
He insisted that it was fine and so we proceeded...
From the amuse bouche, everything was OFF.
The food wasn't what the food runner told us it was, flavors were odd, some over cooked, under/over seasoned courses. It was a mess.

Has a pretty view of the strip, but that's about it.It's just "OK".

We were seated very quickly which was Great.
We ordered and got our waters quickly but that's about as good as the service got....

The waiter forgot our order of Chips and Salsa.  Really?  How hard is chips and salsa... especially when they charge you for them?  And it's not like he was busy... he had 2 tables... ours and one other.  It seemed like he was zoned out on something.

Thankfully, he got our orders into the system and the kitchen got our orders out fairly quickly.

Food was ok... a little salty for my taste.... but I was so hungry I chowed down.  

Had the Enchilada Suiza which was good... lots of chunks of chicken and not just cheese so I was happy with that.  The beans were good but the rice was dry so I mixed it with the beans.

I probably will NOT go back to this La Salsa.  It's a chain so I'll find a different one.This is one of the older libraries in town so its small disorganized and lacking any landscaping. Its right near the college and by the 99 cent store. They have lots of events and movies held here but it is really small.First, the good: Clark County Libraries are up with the times as far as technology and quick check-out (mainly because the technology allows you to do it yourself, because the help desk is a nightmare, but that's another topic). They have a lot of variety and an online search, account maintenance, and renewal service that is very convenient.

Now, the rest. What are libraries mostly known for? That's right - SHHHHHH!! I came to work on a project, figuring that the library would be quiet and cool. 

Heading straight to the back, past all the signs that ask for quiet and insist that no food or liquids are allowed on the premises, I landed in the  near-empty study area. Nice and quiet. 

Ha. 

A security guard passed by me and then met up with one of his buddies. They proceeded to have a long,  LOUD conversation - "HEY BUDDY HOW YA DOIN??!!'" - and yammered on and on and on. Meanwhile, someone's totally unsupervised toddler ran screaming back and forth behind me. This was not the kid's section - nowhere near it. With the guard otherwise engaged who do I complain to? I finally gave up, packed my stuff, and went in search of another area.

Downstairs - where the wifi doesn't work at all and the smelly weirdos hang out by the magazine racks - was not much better. One annoying guy refused to turn off his rap-song ring tone, which went off every 3 minutes. The guard for that area flatly ignored him, too. Wonder what those guards are getting paid for?

Ended up at a Starbucks, where, even with the latte machine blasting away and people coming and going, it was still quieter and the wifi worked better.Came here with the husband because he needed to buy gear for his job. This is a nice store for uniforms and equipment. The merchandise was very organized and the store was clean. Unfortunately, customer service is pretty bad here.

My husband saw a pair of shoes that he liked and wanted to try them on. One employee was busy helping another customer with tailoring, and two other employees were laughing and talking in one of the back rooms with the door wide open. Funny thing is that I'm pretty sure they saw us, along with 2 other customers wanting to try on shoes. Yet, they decided to ignore us all! After waiting for a while, we decided to go up to the counter to ask for help. Someone finally helped us, but disappeared shortly after bringing out the shoes. We wanted to buy them, but no one came to the register, as we stood there for 5 minutes. We handed the shoes to the employee who was still busy with a customer in the tailoring section and left.

Horrible customer service! I don't see how this place stays in business when they don't want to help their customers or even pay attention to what is going on in the store! Definitely would not recommend. We decided to spend our money nearby at American Shooters. Yes, they are a little bit more expensive, but the employees are friendly and they care about their customers!The food is wonderful but the staff is a disappointment!! They forgot to give me my mandarin sauce on the side and I called and they just hung up on me.I came here because i was starving and saw 4stars out of 50 reviewers. I think It's authentic Salvador food but I don't think it's for my taste buds. I'm so used to the usual Mexican style tamales (i got pork and chicken)The corn was super soft like they used too much water in the mix. The flavor was okay a bit bland (I used a lot of tapitio hot sauce). 
My husband also got chicken with cheese pupusas, it wasn't good like two stars. But the crust on the edge was good. The sauce for the pupusas was so bland and water down that I couldn't even tell what it was. The cabbage that came along with it was okay too, It was in the vinegar sauce. 

There wasn't really any service but they are nice. The food took awhile to come out as well. 

I don't think I'll come back since the food I got was watered down and bland. Hope I don't get sick x[We visit about once a week. I've noticed lately they are rude and unfriendly except for their daily customers. My wife and I like to enjoy a good latte every week or so, but we don't want to take out a second mortgage to frequent everyday in order to get the same level of treatment as these daily people.

Today the lady snapped at me for not ordering my drink in the correct Starbucks parlance. You know I'm tired and groggy and just woke up and that's why I'm getting a coffee in the first place. When they get new people that have lighted up I'll come back. Good thing they gave me one of these survey receipts I'll go vent there now.This Safeway sucks! There is never any product on the shelf. When I go to other Safeways there is plenty of the Open Nature products and so much more variety.Not as tasty as i like.One of my pet peeves is false advertising. Was looking for a lunch spot today and came across Rachel's on Yelp. They offered a free muffin with check-in and I was sold.

However, upon presenting my offer, I was told they were sold out of muffins. I asked if they could substitute one of the other items in their pastry case (or anything else) and was told no. After purchasing my lunch and upon leaving, they offered me a beverage, but at that point I was so annoyed, I left.

To be fair, the salad I ordered was fairly good and reasonably priced. Had it not been for this bad experience, I would've given them 4 stars. But customer service is equally as important as the food.Sorry, I cannot give Al's Garage a good feedback. We were there Saturday evening. There was a free concert, and although it was crowded, we found a nice place to eat outside on the patio. We ordered chicken tenders with fries. They were alright, but nothing to write home about. 
We were very patient, but after about 10 minutes, we asked if we could order. It took another 5 minutes until the waitress came to our table. She was very unfriendly and probably unhappy to work that evening. For whatever service we needed (napkins, refill etc) we had to battle to get her attention. She had no smile, or apology whatsoever... The people we shared the table with waited to pay for about 15 minutes. They were also not very satisfied...
There are too many good places around, so why bother and go back...We originally went to the Metro Pizza in Ellis Island and it was great!  We came to this location and the food was very blah.  The italian sauce on the food was very boring.  After we were done eating all the waitresses dissapeared and we had to wait about 20 Minutes for a box and our bill.  The second time we came in we were seated and greeted and given drinks. They didnt have the beer I wanted. Then we were ignored for 20 Minutes again, we left money on the table for our drinks and left, in the meantime I saw approximately 7 employees standing around doing nothing. I dont think we'll be backSo we came here because we had a 15$ off coupon  that expired soon. My boyfriend ordered the Three Mini Burger sampler plate, and I got the house Veggie Burger. We ordered fries, and since the portions were so large for just one got a half order of sweet potato and half garlic and herb. The fry portions are pretty big, it's a BOWL, and it's and extra 4$ for them.

Note: There is indoor seating; you can't see it but it is there.

The fries were not great. Not really bad, but really just plain. The sweet potato fries were the usual mediocre ones that aren't very crispy, and they had a ton of salt clumps on them which really didn't help. The garlic and herb fries- I feel I should tell you the 'herb' is cilantro-  were really greasy, and not infused with the garlic flavor, they just tossed chopped garlic (which looks like it's the pre-chopped kind out of a jar) and cilantro into the bowl and mixed it up.
The Veggie Burger unfortunately is the mushy kind- it doesn't hold up well, and feels like you're eating baby food. On the menu it lists 'Vegetables'  possibly to save space for the list of different types they put in, so I don't know what all is in there, but I saw pieces of bell pepper, so there's that. It was just really mushy and had an odd flavor to it- like water chestnuts mixed with pickles. After a a few bits, it went cold. Not cool to the touch, but cold, and became inedible after that.
My boyfriend said he couldn't tell the difference between his three mini burgers, which were suppose to be samplers of their best burgers there. 
Overall the food wasn't great, and it's not someplace we will be going back to anytime soon.OK, everyone raves about these cupcakes, but I do not get it! For one the price is crazy expensive and the cupcake itself was OK. I tried the red velvet my favorite cupcake and the frosting was tasty without being too sweet, but the cake was dry and fell apart when you try to take the wrapper off. Not going back.Yup, it's food. That's about the best I can say about this place. I got the eggs, sausage, bacon, hash browns, and toast dish. Pretty much everything was super bland and tasteless except the bacon. And that's only because it's bacon. The toast was essentially inedible. 

Don't get me wrong, the staff was really friendly and nice seeming. But they also brought me toast when I asked for biscuits. And kept forgetting to bring my girlfriend the milk she asked for. We had to ask three times. I'd recommend elsewhere for brunch/breakfast. Unless you're just really really hungry.Its a Dennys inside a casino and the chef doesn't know how to cook. They under cooked my steak and over cooked my bf's fish. When we wanted to send it back the waiter was no where to be found. We finally had to ask a different server who got the manager for us. The manager was very polite and took the order off the bill but we weren't able to have it recooked because we were supposed to see a show right after that. So this place gets an extra star because the manager was very accommodating, but the service and food sucked real bad. If what you're looking for is a cheap (in price and quality) Denny's style restaurant in the casino, then this is your place.Ehh, this place was alright. Considering all of the food that is in Vegas, this place is sub par. But I do like the fact that they have so much to offer and so late at night.
Service was a little slow in my opinion, atmosphere was loud and crazy (as it should be in Vegas).
What really bothered me was the prices. I know everything in Vegas is more expensive but geeze, it's like $18+ for everything including small sides... for food that was only mediocre.Nothing sticks out about Saketini that makes it great, so I'm not sure why the average rating is so high.

My friend and I got there on a Monday night around 5:45. The place was dark and practically empty. I started getting panicky that we would not get our orders in before happy hour ended at 6. The server came and brought us water at 5:50 and then didn't come back until right before 6. We made happy hour, but barely. I don't know why the server was taking her time - there was one other table so it's not like it was busy. Hate when people make me nervous.

Anyway, to the rolls. They have a huge list of specialty rolls, but 95 percent of them are deep-fried, baked, stuffed with cheap imitation crab or cali rolls. Only a few had fresh fish in them. So far, not impressed. 

We ordered the spicy salmon and tuna, which were big, chunky and quite spicy. I was happy with these. I ordered a Dbacks specialty roll which was tasty but not amazing. My friend and I shared the Mermaid, which was half price after 6:30, and that was OK. Again, nothing to write home about. Specialty rolls range from $8-12, but they're stuffed with the cheap stuff, so I don't know if they're worth it.

In the end, we had 5 rolls, no drinks and the bill came out to $35, which, if the quality was superb, I would not have had a problem with. I don't think I'd go back, it just wasn't worth it.Meh.

Prices are pretty outrageous for what you get, service is sub-par and the wait was pretty long despite the fact that we had a reservation.

Meh.Bill's is basically a Red Roof Inn plopped in the heart of the center of the LV Strip.  It is plain and not too interesting.  The rooms are clean but the decor is outdated.  Everything seemed to work well enough except when you shower the bathtub fills up above your cankles.  Food at the diner?  Eh.  nothing exciting.  If it was located anywhere else in vegas (off strip or down by the Sahara, the rooms would be $40 per night.  BUT... the location is key - you are next to EVERYTHING.I am so sick of the bad attitude of employees of United Airlines.  I understand that you don't like your jobs, feel like you are underpaid...Doesn't everyone.  Why take it out on the passegers.  I was literrally glared at by the Gate Agent on a recent flight to Denver, when I asked for an aisle seat...I have been a loyal United customer since 1997.  I guess you can say I'm a slave to the Milleage Plus program.  United is certainly better than fellow Star Alliance member U.S. Airways.  I'm just sick of the employees.  I recently flew on Southwest (fluke) and it was a really good experience.  Maybe I should switch.  Too bad Southwest does not fly internationally.I want to know what kind of crack everyone that says this place is the bomb and has great food is smoking, and I want some for myself so that I may smoke it and become just as high.

The food presentation is great and the place is pretty chill. The servers are nice too. It looked like a Gap ad or something inside. They also had an interesting concept and a nice menu. The water had cucumber slices in it which was pretty nice as well. That's where the good times end though...

They have 80 half bottles of wine to choose from... Half bottles. Tiny little bottles that contain a little more than a glass each. Plus the prices are closer to a whole bottle... whatever. At least the food prices seem more reasonable.

The caesar salad we ate was composed of wilted lettuce and the dressing smelled a little off... did not finish. The "tater tots" we had were crispy and all, but they were undersalted and tasted like fake potato... did not finish. Finally, the sliders we had were charred nuggets of coal on the outside, but red and raw on the inside... completely fucking disgusting... did not finish. In fact, I started feeling quite ill halfway through one tiny burger.

And really - these are 3oz burger patties... how long does it take to cook these things? They obviously stuck them right into a raging fire until blackened and dry and then pulled them out before the middle was cooked enough to be safe to eat - that couldn't take more than a few minutes, right? The bread was stale too. I can tell you that these aren't sliders as much as they are bits of charcoal with a raw meat surprise inside... as long as it took for them to cook and bring these tiny disasters out to us, it's definitely going to take me longer to pass these stones - I actually debated heading straight to the bathroom to vomit them up dreading the thought of having to poo them out later.

The wait seemed excessive for everything really. The place wasn't even very busy - perhaps it was because our waitress was busy chasing down some out of town dick. I guess when you're paying nearly 70 bucks for two people (with one half-bottle of wine included), you expect things to go a little smoother than say a McDonalds... but seriously - even though it's been about a decade since I've eaten at McDonalds, I remember them having pretty good service and reliable food. Stax is like McDonalds, but 10x the price and 1/2 the quality.

This place has potential though, so judging from the other reviews - perhaps this was an isolated experience. Your mileage may vary.
_______________________________

Edit: After writing this, I found out that I know the chef here... so now I feel bad. I hope he wasn't on duty when I ate there. I may give it another shot, but honestly it'll be tough since both my girlfriend and I got sick eating here. I've eaten his food before and he's really talented... this was simply awful though, so I'm just going to assume he didn't cook it.This was a little disappointing.  The observation deck was really small.  We waited 30 minutes in line and stayed maybe 15 minutes.  It was really cold.  At night you can see the water show at the Bellagio.  I thought the Stratosphere was much better.  It was bigger and comfortable.Dirty floor, filthy salsa bar, gastly restrooms.  I'm thinking this place is over due for an inspection *nudge *nudge

Look past all that, get your food and it was so-so.  I was over expecting due to the extreme yelps.  

To each there own right, maybe it was just hard to enjoy the meal with all the screaming kids & parents that hardly noticed.  Or the messy setting.  We'll never know.I've been wanting to try out this gym for a while and yesterday I finally did.

I had to input my information into the Lifetime Fitness website and then a few minutes later, (person one) called me (very excited) about my interest in Lifetime Fitness.  I scheduled my visit for later in the day and then within thirty minutes another person, (person two) called me to confirm my schedule.  For a free visit to a gym this is a borderline nuisance and I'm already starting to panic over the barrage of "don't miss out", "special limited time offer" emails that will surely follow.  I feel like I'm about to sit through a time share meeting for a gym visit. 

So, I made it to the gym and I met with my "Membership Manager".  He wanted to take me on a full walk around the facility which I imagined would be a very awkward and unrevelatory experience.  I've been to dozens of gyms all over the world, what is lifetime fitness hiding?!!  I declined the would be man date and skipped straight to the price.  What happened next gave me some insight into how Lifetime Fitness trains their staff.  

After (person two) showed me the price he began the sales tactics.  He asked if the price was in my budget.  Not the best way to approach a new client, but then without my response he said that most people who just ask about price are price sensitive and then after my refusal to give him an answer about whether or not I'd like to join the gym, he insinuated that I couldn't afford the membership.  Big mistake, I don't work in sales but I sure as hell understand the nuances of making a sale.  You failed to identify what I wanted.  I wanted to check out the gym on my own, work out and make an informed decision about whether or not I should ditch 24 hour Fitness.  As it turned out I really like the gym and the facility is great.  I could easily see buying and maintaining a family membership there, but, I sure as hell won't do it by calling (person two).  

What a shame for one sales person to stain your company.  The truth is you don't even need stupid demeaning sales tactics, your facility is great.  Let the building sell itself.  Teach these young representatives to respect their would be clients. 

You, (person two) are an idiot.I came here during CES  --- DJ AM and Travis Barker were making their debut after their horrible accident.. I've seen DJ AM spin in NYC and Miami, so I was excited to hear him play some good music again.

I was with about 20 work colleagues and associates, and since we were on business, we were all buying bottle service (gotta love those company  cards)..  

The bouncer made us wait a good 20-30 minutes outside.  After we walked up the stairs, we told the hostess we wanted tables right on the dance floor.  She said we'd have to buy a few more bottles in order for them to accommodate our request - which we had no problem with.

She took us downstairs and took us to some dark corner behind the stairs, next to the side bar and set up our tables, bottles and refreshments there.  Barely 4-5 people fit back there, let alone 20.. and since we were spending so much money and we specifically requested where we wanted to sit and bought additional bottles, we protested the location with her.   

She brought over 2 big bouncers who basically told us that if we didn't like it, we could leave -- AFTER they already charged us and opened up our bottles.

My friends and I attempted to mingle through the crowd, but it was so annoyingly crowded with douchehats and sluts, we went back to our area.

Oh and P.S. - The music sucked.  I don't want to hear Journey and Michael Jackson mashups all night long. 

Thankfully the vodka didn't disappoint.We were there last weekend and we went after watching le reve around 10ish. We had no problem getting in. It was definitely an older crowd (30-50). It's a lounge more than a club. Compared to tryst at the same hotel, it's probably 1/4 to 1/5 the size.i was tricked into going to this dumpy little wanna-be dos gringos (and if you're aspiring to that be bar...) by some friends who live in the area and said this place had "GREAT breakfast food."

excited to try a new brekkies joint, i came into bongo's and was immediately reminded of Gilligan's. Crap on the walls like surfboards and fake bamboo-ish looking wallpaper... a couple of booths and about ten tall tables with stools (boo - no place to lean back or hang your purse) and one enormous menu. i mean it - that menu is daunting.

here's the thing. how about instead of offering a million crappy entrees, you just pick oh, i don't know, 20 of the favorites and be really good at preparing those. right away, i have to say, i judged the place for trying to cram too much stuff in the kitchen. here's another thing - somehow nothing of the 40 or so breakfast offerings sounded any good. not even a safe bet choice like eggs benedict? oi. on top of the crappy choices, they wanted $9 and up for this shit? and $3.75 for a screwdriver made with orange drink was their special?!

so i went the unsafest bet i could have; the breakfast burrito. i know, i should have known better. country gravy in a burrito? what was i thinking? i panicked at the enormity of the menu i guess. it was nothing worth mentioning...about as salty and greasy as they come.

ah well, not my kind of place, but i can it being a hit with the young 20's Chandler crowd (yeah, i'm assuming their a Chandler bar circuit).Not happy with my pho!!! A simple request as to not include onions in my pho wasn't even met! I was told by the guy to pick them out myself. A BIG WTF!!! The lights went out midway during my meal... because apparently there was a birthday party and people were singing nonstop on stage. Not exactly a family oriented restaurant. My family couldn't even speak to each other without yelling... otherwise we could only see each other's lips move. Not coming back. There's better pho places in Vegas who actually listens when the customer requests for no onions. UGH.MMM, southern fried chicken... but I was really disappointed that they didn't have a boneless option.  Unfortunately, I can't each meat off a bone, so no chicken for me :(

I loved the unsweetened iced tea!  It had such a good flavor.

They did have a vegetarian option, a vegetable plate that came with all the vegetables.  The portion was huge.  The flavor of all the vegetables wasn't the greatest; it was rather bland.  Plus, I noticed standing water at the bottom of the plate, so I'm not sure if the veggies were drained properly.  

They accept credit cards, but only Visa and MasterCard.So I have to give the owner of Sundrops credit. She reached out to me, not sure if this was prompted by the yelp review or she genuinely was calling customers. I gave her honest feedback about everything that happened. 

She did send me and my friend gift cards, so has any girl would do we decided to give it another shot. First the nail techs this time around were way better. Just the same blah service. 

The girl that works the front counter has got to go! I stood there at the counter trying to check in for 5 minutes!!!! Finally my friend chirps up and says were hear for appointments, She replies back "I know" Come on, really - Why don't you greeat me after I walk in the door.  SALES 101

The last point I am going to say, is that everytime I call on the weekend they are booked and there are no walk-ins. On my 2nd trip, I called ahead to make an appointment and I was told they had a big party coming in at 1 so it had to be 11:30. When we got there, I think their were two customers. There service just doesn't warrant the prices or the appointment setting. Sorry I really wanted you to be my new nail salon.I feel as though this place deserves maybe two and a half stars... it really wasn't that bad- it just wasn't that good either. 

Came for dinner with my husband. The only reason is we got into a conversation with one of the managers while we were gambleing at a hotel up the strip. He told us to go in and tell them he sent us for a round of drinks on the house. Sounded like a good idea so we went. I had margaritas, which were pretty standard tasting- nothing super exciting.  

We did have a table with a nice veiw of the strip so we were able to people watch (always entertaining in Vegas) 

The food was decent. Again, nothing super exciting. Hubby had wings which were tasty and I had a chicken burrito. I enjoyed the one wing I stole from him and the chicken burrito was actually pretty tasty- though nothing about it was anything out of the ordinary.

The only thing that freaked me out? going into the ladies room to find a little woman lurking in the corner with an assortment of toiletries spread on the counter and a tip bowl for when she hands you a paper towel. Um. Random. I am perfectly capable of getting my own paper towel. And no, I will not tip you for that "service".Low-quality, overpriced Mexican food - some of the worst guacamole I've ever had.  Go for the fun atmosphere, NOT the food!  

Our waitress was really, really nice though, so they get an extra star!

They had a good bar atmosphere and a super slutty, girl who looked like a prostitute dancing on the front table, pouring shots into people's mouths - a couple of my friends partook, it was fun to watch!Not as many stores as I was anticipating... the crowds were horrendous, too. Vehicular ingress/egress needs some work. Poorly planned.Always liked Nathan dogs. But $12 for a dog and a lemonade? That's pricey. I could've found a cheaper item at the 24/7 Cafe down the casino for a sit down meal.The food was pretty good, nothing overly exciting.  I was impressed by the wine selection.  I would give this place a higher rating if their service was better.  It has been lackluster at best.Decor is nice, service well intentioned - actually Fernando was really sweet, but the restaurant was almost empty and the manager came over to hush our bachelorette dinner... the edamame was overcooked, but they replaced well. Our lemons drops came with SALTED rims, but they replaced them. Food was good but not memorable. Won't be back.Imagine a cracker that doesn't have much flavor to it.

Now imagine some reasonably tasty sauce, cheese, and mushrooms on top of the tasteless cracker.

Now imagine having to wait nearly 30 minutes for your thing-which-does-not-taste-much-like-pizza to arrive.

And imagine the waitress doesn't really seem to give a crud about your dining experience.

What you're now imagining, describes today's lunch experience.Once upon a time, corporate restaurants were evil, and celebrity chef owned restaurants, were a slice of heaven. Once upon a time...these days, it's all the same sh*t!

First off, Payard is actually a three part restaurant, here in Caesar's Palace. It's a restaurant, with a smaller, order at the counter quick-cafe style section, as well, as a "Payard Express" which isn't even connected to the restaurant or to-go counter, but rather, closer to the casino.

We went to the cafe, to-go section. At first glance, it's a pretty space, but seriously, what isn't in a Vegas style hotel these days. The selection, even for a quick bite, looked pretty slim. It's ok, I thought, smaller menu usually means a more finely tuned menu! Or, so I thought. 

As I was in a group of five, we all ordered different things, with the intent to try a little of everything. We ordered; a croque monsieur, a chicken and mushroom crepe, a banana and caramel crepe, an almond croissant as well as a regular croissant.

The chicken and mushroom crepes were just plain T-A-S-T-E-L-E-S-S. I mean, NO seasoning whatsoever. The croque monsieur tasted good, HOWEVER, I've had ice that was warmer than this sandwich. It was heated up, extremely unevenly! Too bad, as this was the tastiest thing we ordered. The banana caramel crepe was ok, as were the two croissants.

Oh, and the service? HORRIBLE! The women working here, all had attitude! No one had a smile on their face, which I couldn't care less about, but God forbid you ask them a question! I asked a woman behind the counter, what time the restaurant portion closes at night, she looked at me with a blank stare and said, "they're right next door, why don't you walk over there, and ask them".

It's a shame, I really did have high hopes for Payard. Should have stuck with Bouchon!

Food: 3
Ambience: 5
Service: 1
Value: 2So disappointing. I've eaten here so many times and had nothin but rave reviews; that was before I became a Yelper. :)

Server must have been having a bad night because she set the whole time which was basically not good. I want to say how good the food was (appetizer was the fried shrimp and I love it every time) but I don't want to take focus away from how bad the service was. Dang it! I was going I take a picture of the stack of appetizer, salad, and side plates at the end of our table cause they were there for sinking and when I finally decided to whip out the camera she cleared them. Must have seen me typing. Lol. Refills were non existent, server forgot Jen's beer she ordered after being seated and finally brought it after my second refill on soda and after Jen asked for a different beer. She was apologetic and I'm the last person to be mean or belittle a server unless they are outright rude. Our server wasn't rude; just having a bad night i guess. The table next to is were being jerks so maybe it's all their fault. Lol

Our food came and I ate so now I can talk about the food. Aaaaarrgh! No that wasn't a pirate roar. It was the sound of frustration. I really do love this place. And I was sooooo determined tom order something different than the New Orleans chicken which I can't seem to tear myself away from. Tonight, I was a pioneer; a trend setter; Capt. Kirk. In orders their marinated steak cooked mid rare. Mmmmmmm. Well ironworks have been of it wasn't over cooked and completely bland and flavorless. If that hunk of meat had been marinated for 24 hours like the menu states, it must have been in a bucket of water.  Booooo. See what happens when you try new things!  Jen order ribs and some "burnt ends" bbq'd meat combo. They were good. That's all I can say. I didn't even ask for a box for mine. 

Also, I'm all for a nice AC environment during the AZ summer but holy smokes, I couldn't find a knife so I cut my steak with my nipples. Good thing I wore long sleeves or I would have had I amputate due to frostbite. 

Ok so in closing. Jen is quoted as saying, "I loved my food." Everything else sucked. I have never had a bad experience here before I'm over a half dozen visits in the last couple years. That makes this so much harder because I think my feelings got hurt. I have bragged about this place to so many I should be getting kick backs. Don't these people know who I am. Geesh!  Lol. I'm sure I will be back but I won't be so eager to do so anytime soon.  I'm sad now. :(

P.S.  Quit taking my silverware and leaving me nothing to eat with. Also, the Mac and cheese was bland and was really bad.  There is virtually no cell service and absolutely no wi-fi. So frustrating. Ok I'm done.Mediocre food.

I havent visited aince I last came which was about 3 years ago.Another groupon purchase. A few months back I saw this groupon and purchased it, and it wasn't until a few weeks ago that I had the chance to go. I have been really into vegetarian sushi lately so I was excited to try this place. And Meh... is appropriate for this place. 

I came with my mom and husband on a Thursday night. The place wasn't busy at all and it was around 7pm. I think there were two other parties. When we walked in, the servers all looked at us. It took a few seconds of them staring at us for one to tell us to sit where we want, and then another few moments before anyone brought us menus. I had looked over the menu online before hand so I knew there were a few choices for me. I decided on the avocado rolls, vegan roll, and the tofu tofu roll. As far as the taste of them goes, they were all kind of bland. Even after dipping them in soy and wasabi. There were no sesame seeds on them which helps give them extra flavor. And the wasabi was unusually bland as well. I hardly got any spice from it at all. The most disappointing roll was the tofu tofu roll. It was different, deep fried tofu with green beans rolled inside of the tofu. So there was no rice in this roll. It was just ok. Again, really bland. They could have jazzed up the tofu or something. Everyone knows tofu needs love to taste good. Just tofu cut into blocks and deep fried isn't going to be very tasty.

My mom and husband got the Atkins roll and another one with yellow fin. They were also less than impressed with their selections.  One thing I noticed about this sushi place versus others I have been to, is the portion sizes are way smaller here. I ordered three rolls for me, which at any other sushi places stuffs me to the point where I feel like I am going to explode. Three rolls here, and I was still hungry. It made me sad. The only good thing this place has got going for it is the vegetarian rolls are all really cheap. Which is nice. The price of the fish rolls are all really expensive though. We had a $30 groupon and we still ended up paying an extra $15 on top of that because of how expensive the rolls were. Service here left a lot to be desired as well. The servers all stood around and talked with each other the whole time we were here. And we had to call to them for them to come over to the table. We probably wont be coming back here just because there are so many other sushi places in town better than this one.food was ok, but cost was also OK.... nothing amazing about it, and the atmosphere sucked, i will not be going again.I went here with a work lunch, which took just over an hour.The atmosphere was wonderful, and the staff was very friendly. The menu seemed quite large, but they had a simple "lunch special" page that seemed to have a nice variety at good prices.

I ordered the Red Curry with chicken, at a low-to medium spice level, and everyone else at my table ordered Pad Thai and the same Red Curry. The special came with a choice of salad or spring roll, and I ordered a spring roll, but received a Salad. The food came in a fairly staggered manner. There were five of us, and three of us received our food, (mine with the wrong side), then after about 5 minutes, a fourth dish came out, and after another 10, the 5th. Which short of left us with the "do I eat while this is hot, or wait and not be rude" conundrum. It ended up that they had confused the sides on the two curries, so I swapped with one of my co-workers, and it was not a big deal.

The food overall was good but lackluster. My curry seemed to rely on the spiciness as the primary seasoning, and could have used a little bit of salt or...something. Curry doesn't have to be hot in order to be flavorful; it seemed sort of one-dimensional, though the "heat" level was just as advertised, which is something I appreciate as a Spice Wuss. 

The low point of the meal, though, was when I noticed that one of my companions who had ordered the Pad Thai, had a nice collection of egg shell bits gathered on the corner of his plate. It had taken him a minute, he said, to figure out what the sharp crunchy bits were.

I probably won't be back for dinner or on my own, but the proximity to my office and reasonable lunch prices will probably bring me back at least once more to see if they were just having an off day. Hopefully I can update this review with another star then! :)I can honestly say that I'm not a fan of this theater. 
Every time I go here the lines are long for beer and food and the staff does not seem to have their stuff together.

As for the purchase of tickets, you have to sit in the seat you purchased.....
Well----it does not work like it should and causes more distraction than anything.

If one person messes up their seats, so many others coming into the theater seem to fall in line with sitting somewhere else and it is just mad crazy. It is not fun trying to watch the upcoming movie trailers at the beginning of a movie I just paid for when there is a group of people fighting about someone sitting in their seats. I hate it! 

I was talking to a guy who had never been to this theater before, and the first thing he said about it was that he had NO CLUE or any indication that he had to sit in his purchased seat. To me this says any new person coming to this theater without reading a yelp.com review or asking someone will just automatically assume that it is like any other theater in Madison and just pick the best seats available once they walk into the theater. 

Ok, sure, I get it...your seats are printed on the tickets you purchased---but in all honesty to anyone new coming to this theater----this is a new thing for them and they will most likely sit where they want until they are kicked out by someone--- Then everyone gets mad, people make noise, stand up in front of me, and I can't get my full paid movie experience. This makes me angry and now my movie is going to suck.

I can honestly say this happens every time I go to this theater, I can count on it...just like clockwork. 

"You are in my seat"

Now to mention the seat prices----Expensive! I'm so confused why they are charging me a 
"seat reservation fee" every time I come here. What is that about? I thought everyone has a reserved seat to sit in once you purchase the ticket
----I call shenanigans on this one!!!!!!!! 

On a plus note----It is very clean, comfy seats, and great choices of food and beer if you get in line early enough. Nice location with plenty of parking!!!! 

It's a nice place, just not my cup of tea.I would give this location 3-4 stars. I'm rating 2 due to a bad experience explained below...

Harkins is my favorite theater, and my loyalty started when I moved to AZ and used to take my 3 little cousins and even the neighbor's kid to the movies. 

Back then I would have never been able to afford AMC prices, I cannot believe how expensive they are.

We get the shirt, the loyalty cups, and passes over the mail, sometimes we get the passes at Costco too. For hubby and I to go to Harkins it is $15 dlls including ticket, soda refill, and popcorn (I get the popcorn vouchers because of the shirt, and 1 voucher for every $25 popcorn refill).  If we go to AMC, it is about $18 for the soda and popcorn alone.

That said... we had a very bad experience a couple of weeks back. We were by the hall waiting for the theater to be ready to see Elysium. There were about 8 of us that I noticed, but hubby and I were next by the door as we were among the first ones to arrive. I actually thought we were the first ones, but one of the staff ladies (red shirt) stopped by and told us a gentleman sitting in a bench had been the first one to get there. Duly noted. Hubby and I made conversation with a fellow movie goer and his son... and when the room was ready, my hubby made a signal to the aforementioned gentleman to go first, while we were getting ready to go sit. Unbeknownst to us, this staff lady had made up her mind about us being rude and not caring about her bringing to our attention that he was there first. She stood in front of me, her back towards me, right by the door, so I could not step in until she decided it was appropriate. Of course, while she was standing in front of me, some other people skipped the line and ran in front of her (I remember what seemed to me a father and 2 sons, that is topic for a whole other conversation) and by the time we made it in our preferred seats were gone (we like sitting on the first row, but also I had an injury last year and my ankle and foot  hurt and get swollen, so believe me, it is important for me to have my feet up, and that is why we always get there way ahead of time)...

Never mind that the person she was 'protecting' went and sit all the way to the back.

I have a lot of stress in my life, like probably everyone else. The last thing I need is to pay for a service and be disrespected this way. I also try not to let this kind of stuff ruin my day, but I found this episode very upsetting. If she was so concerned about this one customer, she could have asked what seat he preferred and go save it for him.  She didn't have to ruin our 'moviegoing' experience.

That was totally uncalled for.Decent food, but the service is needlessly slow in the dining room. Wings are passable, not really big. Fans of the New England style "Wings Over" chain or Anchor Bar will be dissatisfied.  Good selection of sauces, but the hot brings only heat, no real spice flavor.I was with my sister on Mill Ave looking for some food to eat. We thought Greek would be awesome but then we saw Crave was gone and My Brg Fat Greek burned down. So we came across MedFresh and decided to give it a go. We both ordered gyros with lamb and beef and some hummus. First of all, the hummus had a strange aftertaste, I decribed it as if there was whiskey or some sort of alcohol in it. It was tolerable to eat but I wouldn't order it again. Then our gyros came out and I didn't like the flavors that came with it. It had too much stuff in it like pickles, lettuce, onions, not sure what I normally have in a gyro but it just didn't taste right. So we left and my plate had half a gyro and a lot of stale fries that I couldn't eat. The staff was very nice and attentive but the food quality will cause me to never return.Bloody Mary's rate no stars. Appetizers were good but repeated attempts to get steak right failed. Server was busy but attentive. Loved the live music. Go for the atmosphere. Loved the open patio over Fremont Street.The last three times the toppings on the pizza fall far short of the edge. In fact, all of the outer pieces had no toppings. Quite a waste of money, considering how pricey. I called to inquire about this, no answer, just "sorry". It's too bad, because this is my favorite pizza, when prepared properly. I'm done.Waitress seemed overall too busy to serve us. She took our orders and then we didn't see her the rest of the night until my friend approached her about needing refills and the complimentary chips and salsa. Food came out after 20+ minutes on a non busy Monday night. The Mexican pizza came out soggy and cold and was blamed that it was cooked too long...after we showed our discontent they seemed to am pup their service slightly. I used to some here a lot and every time their service and overall environment has gone more towards the gutter each time.We ate here on the lunch of New Year's Eve 2010. My ribs were burnt (black charred, inedible) and my husband's $40 steak was cooked unevenly. They comped  my ribs and drink but still charged me for the salad that they asked if I wanted instead of the ribs. The waiter said they were slammed preparing for the New Year's evening rush, but it's still unacceptable. One positive is that the Carne Cruda was good. Overall restaurants in Vegas don't have to care about repeat customers.I went there after lunch time, so it wasn't busy. The little boy behind the counter took my order and had me waiting by the cashwrap for over 15 minutes! Finally I sat down and 10 minutes later I told him to cancel my order, he looked dumbfounded, and I walked out.A little underwhelmed, a little over stimulated, but I wouldn't fight my friends or refuse to show up if they planned a happy hour here. The identity crisis between sports bar and sushi bar was a little distracting to me - we sat outside where TVs were playing some sporting event, but inside seemed more like Feng Shui-ed. The restrooms were highly entertaining with remote controlled toilets and sensor activated zen inspiring pebble sinks; if I wasn't so hungry I probably would have spent more time in there playing with the gadgets. 

We unfortunately had just missed happy hour, but I could see how the slashed prices may be somewhat redeeming. The menu had some pretty decent veg options. However, the tofu lettuce wraps had a sour funk that smelled like feet. They didn't taste much better either so I'd steer clear of those if I were ever to stumble on the occasion where I had no choice but to dine here. I'll admit the veggie roll was actually tasty, not enough to make me a loyal patron though.

I've had better food. I've had better atmosphere. I've spent less money on mediocre sushi. I left feeling satiated, but after trying to wash those lettuce wraps down with sake, I still had to brush the sour feet out of my mouth when I got home.So, me and my gf were downtown walking in the area. We're both from California and we know good sushi. It was after 9pm and we looked for somewhere to eat and instead of bar food we decided to come here.

We were seated right away. We ordered sake right away and the waitress gave us 2 glasses for beer. Not the way you are suppose to serve sake. Anyways, I also decided to get beer and I told her we'll just keep the glasses and to bring some sake cups which she did. Minus 1/2 star.

We ordered from the sushi menu since we were both waiting to dinner together. Chicken wings were not crunchy and lacked flavor. Minus 1/2 star. Yellowtail was okay but not great. We also ordered a couple of interesting rolls Gaijin (some kind of chimichanga roll) and I don't remember the other but it wasn't memorable at all. The waitress totally forgot about bringing the gaijin roll and I had to remind her. Then another waitress came over and asked me a couple minutes later which roll they forgot. OMG. Minus 1 star.

The waitress didn't have an idea of what she was doing and lacked any kind of knowledge of the food. My gf asked what kind of sashimi they had and she didn't have a clue and she started guessing some names. Minus 1 star.

Would I come here again? NO WAY will I eat sushi in AZ ever again!!!Such a shame this place has such terrible service because the atmosphere and happy hour is great! Have rented a karaoke room, came for lunch and did happy hour... Every time horrible service! Long waits for food and drinks, servers and bartenders have poor attitudes... Pretty sure we won't be backI am not from Arizona and had flown in to visit my boyfriend. We decided to get sushi on a Saturday night around 7. The restaurant was pretty packed. We were greeted by someone who shouted across the room and then ushered to the bar area outside. 

I must say, the decor and vibe of the place was one of a kind. However, so was the bartender. He came over after we had just sat down to get our drink orders. Even before I uttered out the name of the martini I wanted, he's got his hands out for our IDs. He did show us how to do a saki bomb and my sex on the peach martini was quite strong. 

The food we ordered trickled to us slowly. However, we did not have any plates or forks or anything of that matter. After I asked a server to bring us silverwear/chop sticks, I watched him return to the sushi bar and completely forgot about us. My boyfriend had to hunt down the bartender so we could actually eat instead of sitting there and staring at our food. 

Seaweed salad was lacking vinegar, it was a bit bland. The potstickers were ok, after you dip it in the extremely spicey sauce you mask any kind of taste anyways. We got the dragon roll and the captai crunch rolls and the spicey tuna. They were mediocre and yes, they were pretty much loaded with sweet sauce and deep fried; except for the spicey tuna. We were never asked if we wanted dessert. Instead, we just received our bill.

The entire time we were there though, I could hear all the drama between the servers. It was like a catfight and I had front row seats to the show. Definitely not very professional. My biggest complain is the service, this place would be 1000X better if the servers actually did their jobs.You suck. I ask you if I should order the burger, patty melt or hot dog and you said go with the patty melt.

It was dry, full of onions and lacked taste. 

The only reason you didn't get one star is because at least it was cheap.This Cafe Rio cannot get orders for groups right.  I have tried through their Catering line, online, and over the phone and they NEVER have gotten the order correct.  This time, the order was placed online and paid for online.  Pick up time for 11:45.  The order was not ready at 11:45 or noon for that matter.  And the person behind the counter asked for our list of food we ordered instead of reading it off their computer!  They received the online order because they received the payment.  The order was not ready until 12:30.  We asked for a manager and were denied.  This is going to corporate.  No, we will not be placing any group orders every again and will we tell everyone at the office about our experience.yes 2 stars. Fries were cold and hard, and burger seemed EHH.  I dont have these where I live so I was excited to get one. They did give my dog a patty which I thought was cool. BUT the fries killed it for me and the burger just seemed off.I want to preface this review by stating that I have over 25 years experience in retail management and customer service so I understand fully the rigors of large big box store and interfacing with customers on a daily basis. 

I was pretty appalled at my recent shopping experience there and because of what occurred I won't shop there again. Prior to this I liked this store a lot and shopped there often. Its clean and well organized. Generally the staff is helpful and not pushy and they have great discounts on plants in the garden department. 

I went in to buy 4 eye screws for a shelf I had at home. My sale totaled a little over 5 bucks for the 4 screws. I paid for them inside the store and specifically asked the cashier to put the receipt in the bag where it would be visible as I next was going to the garden department to check out some plants on my way out. it was a small bag and the receipt was hanging out of it not to mention the bags they use at Lowe's are translucent and you can see through them fairly well. 

I picked out 3 plants in the garden department and went to the counter to pay. I placed the bag of the screws on the counter as I went to get cash out of my purse. The receipt was hanging out on the top of the bag and you could also see it through the side of the bag. I was really taken aback when the cashier asked to see my receipt for the stuff in the bag. I cancelled my purchase and went to the front to ask for a manager. 

He explained that it was store policy for the cashiers in the garden department to ask for receipts for items not purchased in the garden department. I've made 25 or more purchases the same way... first in the store then out to the garden department to get some plants.. and NOT ONCE has anyone EVER asked to see my receipts. My own experience in managing a big box store that's owned by the same company as Lowe's tells me that this is NOT their policy and the policy is to ask for a receipt for a large un-bagged item that is hand carried by the customer such as a garden hose or a carpet or lumber etc. The fact that the bag was on the counter with the receipt hanging out of it and clearly visible should have been more than enough for this cashier. I can only venture to guess that she had a desire to exert petty authority and this is how she did it. I've seen this before and had the unhappy experience of managing the same type of employees and had to counsel and re train them.  Nobody wants their shopping experience to include a shake down and I certainly felt it was way out of line. 

I got a call from one of the store managers the following day after complaining to the corporate office and I felt his response was lack luster. While he valued my input as a consumer he sure didn't do anything to win me back as a customer. If this had come across my desk as a manager I would have asked that customer to come into the store and offer them a $10 gift card to show how much I wanted them back. I'm not looking for handouts but I spend money at Lowe's every month. In protecting those 5 dollars worth of eye screws they lost hundreds in future sales. A 10 buck gift card could have won that back. its simple math. 

I'm back to shopping at Home Depot now and that is where I'll stay. The prices are lower overall and they seem to value the customer a great deal more.I don't get the hype of this place.  Maybe it's a west coast thing but the burgers were small, thin, and bland and the special sauce was whack.  Cookout is greater than In-N-Out burger.Horrible Service. Extremely slow to seat us... and feed us... and water us... and bill us... slooooow.
We won't be going back.So I'm standing there in 100 degree heat in late September and they try and pull this on me after I just spent a week staring staring at honest-to-goodness sandstone? I'm here to make sure this place brings them long enough to get drunk and get hyped for a night of gambling and more expensive drinks, and they bring me this vinyl piece of garbage? I had them send the whole truckload back and bring me something of more substance. It's not going to fool anyone paying attention, but ripped guys too drunk to notice that the women they are trying to take back to their smelly hallway won't think twice about the stuff we ended up installing; that's all I'm looking for, really.

Of course they can drink in the river. I hear those fools at Mandalay Bay actually kick people out for dumping a bucket of spiked frozen ice in their tubes. If our customers are forced to drink before getting in the pool and then get out to reload, that means they are taking breaks from drinking to swim. Look at it this way: we let them bring whatever they want into the river and we can get a good three more drinks into these fools before we kick them out at 5:00 in time for overpriced dinner and losing bets.

Don't worry about it. It all washes out in the flow and the filters. There's plenty of chlorine.

Music? We've got it taken care of. We get enough bass to shake loose their filling and then pump different mixes into each pool. The PA system is tied into the highs, so the thumping keeps going even when we announce the drink specials.

Oh, and get that pudgy toddler out of here. No, the eleven year-old girl booty dancing to "I'm a throw this money while you do it with no hands."

Pro tip: If you get caught in a logjam of middle-aged fat guys in bad wigs, just shout, "Group photo!"Had yami yami roll and hawaii roll. (23.00)
Sushi was pretty good. 
Restaurant is nice.

Thay gave me a dirty plate and napkin when I sat down.

The wasabi was really watery and grainy. 

As I saw in other reviews, the service was SLOW. restaurant was maybe half full for lunch.
No real reason to come back again, better pptions are out there.Being Japanese from Hawaii, I grew up with sushi and Japanese food. This place was just okay. The Hawaiian poke was not too good. They mixed it with ocean salad which is kinda weird for poke, the fish was spongy and the poke sauce was weird tasting. They have a big selection of sushi, But the taste of it was just mediocre.  I wouldnt take my visitors there. If I'm going to eat sushi, I'll go to island sushi instead. They have the absolute best sushi!!Not impressive. Our waiter was a total tool, a young kid who pretty much ignored us most of our meal.  Im not sure if he was new or just dumb.

1. Neglected to bring us the complimentary bread.
2. We requested lemons to go along with our waters, failed there.
3. Our drinks were not a priority of his, chatting up other waiters was more important.
4. We ordered appetizers for our table of 4 to share, he neglected to mention that appetizers would only be enough for each of us to taste a small morsel.
5. Never came by during our meal or after to check on us.
6. Hald of our pizza was burned on the crust. Normally I would chalk this up as an "it happens" but it seeing how the rest of our experience was going I was peeved.
7. We waited for a good 15 minutes after finishing our meal for him to finally come by and ask if we were ready for the check. Then we waited another 20 minutes, deciding finally to go ahead and flag down the manager to run the card.

We did express to the manager, Danny that our meal wasnt quite what we had expected. He listened and did seem genuinely concerned, even stepping outside the restaurant as we were leaving and offering us complimentary dessert.

Nice effort on his part, but the whole conversation with him was a little awkward.

Overall, you can probably guess that I think the service was terrible, and to be honest for the price the portions were meager. 

I had heard good reviews about this place and was eager to try it, but based upon my recent experience I dont think I will be returning.Service advisor that greeted me was showing little interest of my LS issue.  They were running around in crisis trying to locate loaner car for someone else.  Not what I am use to by a Lexus dealership.  I drove away.With the superfluity of fro-yo places in town, U-Swirl just doesn't hit the mark.  They offer a variety of self-serve flavors but only two of them were tart!  Their original flavor just tasted... well... OFF.  Good quality fro-yo is flavorful and creamy; at U-Swirl, I would have no clue what flavor I was eating if I didn't read the label and the consistency was icy.  

And my biggest gripe of all was there was no mochi!!

I'd give it 1.5 stars but I guess I'll up it an extra 0.5 for it's modern decor.The wings are good here and always love getting the habanero mango, but the service the last time I went here was horrible, server was a bitch from the beginning and ruined the experience at this location, the manager didn't seem to care when we complained too.I like the layout of the restaurant and the patio is very nice, but the sushi leaves a lot to be desired. Some food items are decent and then there are many that just lack any flavor. The wait staff has been very slow every time I've been there. If you sit on the patio, expect to have your patience tested, or just go inside yourself to place an order.Deceptive sales practices!  Buyer beware!  The sales guy sells you that if you buy a detail package for $89, he will throw in three free car washes but really you only get two. One is counted when you get the detail.

Ok. It was bothering me, so I went in and asked for a refund for the detail and they made it right by giving me a free coupon for a works wash.Over priced menu. They charge you $4 for a regular cup of coffee in the morning! 

The restaurant looks nice, but the food doesn't match the visual quality, and the prices they charge are absurd for what you get.I'm shocked by the solid 4-star rating on this place. We decided to try Maizies on $3 burger night - maybe that was our mistake. The line was long, the bar was packed, the bartender RUDE and the staff couldn't handle the crowd. The inexperienced staffers were all visibily flustered, bumping into guests and noticibly iritated by the people in their way (just waiting). We got a table near the door and that was awful - they should just move those tables all together. We were getting pushed over and over again and even asked to stand up to let other patrons squeeze into their seats. 

Now, onto the decor... yikes. Its like they just moved all their leftover dorm room furniture into the place. Random wire racks holding menus and plastic containers everywhere and a few rugs hung on the wall - eh? Invest in some decor. 

Oh, that's right.. the food. Yeah, standard burger they were clearly cranking out in the back (you can't make any modifications) and the rest of the items didn't compensate for the bland "I could have made this on my grill in the comfort of my own home" burger. 

Take your $3 to Carl's Junior and get the $6 burger the way you like it.I've been three times now: the first time with a big group/private party where I was dazzled; the second time with a girlfriend where it was ho-hum; and the third time just last week with the boyfriend where I was pretty disappointed.

For the large event, the quality of food was outstanding. I was so excited to try these dishes I'd never had before.  At the time, I was newly vegetarian, and my taste buds were exploding with every bite.  The Lentil Cake Towers blew my mind, and I couldn't get enough of the little bites of heaven.

The second time, I expected the same: outstanding flavors, great service, and an overall terrific experience.  The only thing terrific was the Mango Martini (wowie, it's delicious).  Trying to maneuver the menu options for vegan & gluten free was far too complicated and confusing.  I ordered the Lentil Cake Towers again, and they were delicious.  We also ordered the Seared Tofu as another app, and they were so-so.  I love tofu, but knew I wouldn't be ordering them again.  I ordered the Vegetable Naan Wrap; good but missing... something.

The third time, I insisted we have the Mango Martini.  They were out of a couple ingredients, but the bartender did what he could with what he had - his improvisational attempt was still delicious.  This time, we ordered the Seared Eggplant which had great flavor but was overcooked and soggy; the Lentil Cake Towers, which were good but nowhere near the explosion of flavor the previous two times; and the Vegetable Samosa, which was a disappointment.

The saving grace of the third trip was Gabriel (I'm really hoping that's his name...), the bartender and our server.  He was attentive and on his game.  So much so that my boyfriend commented if he were opening his restaurant here instead of San Diego, he'd snatch Gabriel up in a heartbeat.Been here a few times and every time, the service seemed very slow...

Looks like there's plenty of people moving about but no service was being given. The food wasn't too bad. The bottomless fries were fine. Once I even substituted for bottomless broccoli. Of all the typical burger places with this kind of atmosphere, this place can do better.

Last time, I ordered a Chili Chili Burger and there was barely any chili on it even though on the menu, it was painting an image of a lot of chili on this awesome hamburger. Turns out, it was just a hamburger. :/Out shopping yesterday I was tired, hungry and sniffily(sp?) so I decided some Changs Lettuce wraps and Wonton soup were in order for lunch. The first time I called it sounded like somebody hung up. I've cut people off too so no big deal. Called back and sat on hold for what felt like forever until a surly sounding guy took my order and told me 15 minutes. I go there expecting it to be busy and that was why the guy was crabby but it was probably only 1/3 full. I walk in and there is nobody up front, so I go to the bar and wait and 5 minutes-no bartender. I go back up front and find and ask the host about the bartender and she says he'll be back soon so I continue to wait at the bar, no bartender no nobody. Finally the guy comes back and asks me "you have the soup right?" Yeah I did. I reluctantly tipped him a couple bucks and headed home only to find super salty lettuce wrap filling- like buckets of salt on it- and sub-par soup. I just had this soup less than a week ago from the Changs at Kierland and it was awesome. This one had a few scrawny looking shrimp in it where it usually comes with big juicy thick shrimp. And something was off with the broth too, didnt taste right at all. I have loved this soup for years and this was the first time I have been disappointed. Oh well, I will just avoid this location in the future!I am always on the hunt for great Kung Pao Chicken.  When I was staying at the Venetian, I thought I would try it at Zine.  The Hot and Sour Soup I ordered was very good, but the Kung Pao Chicken ($24) was no more memorable than what I can get at Panda Express.  The dish has red/green bell peppers and water chestnuts(?) as fillers, which are my personal markers of a cheap dish.  I expect fillers in a $5.00 Panda Express portion, but not a $24.00 meal.Service was very slow. The lunch buffet was non existent there was like one slice of pizza cold and sitting out and on top of that we waited 10 minutes at the door and weren't acknowledged. Extraordinarily disappointed and will not return for that reason.This place is bad. I'm all for dive bars, but this place is just brutal. I felt dirty just coming here.

Best Nights:
(choose up to 3)     NeverAfter reading all the other reviews, I was excited to try out George's with my husband. We normally go to Pita Shack in Tempe when we are looking for a good Gyro but we were on the north side of town and wanted to grab a quick dinner. Looked up some options on Yelp which is what led us to Georges. My husband ordered the Gyro with jalapeños, onions and peppers and I ordered the traditional Gyro with a side salad. We also ordered some Spanakopita and 2 drinks. Honestly the best thing about the meal was the side greek salad. Gyro meat was cold... which was kind of a bummer as we waited just about 15 minutes for the two pitas to come out. What really irked me was after we had checked out and were waiting for our food, a group of guys walked in and the girl asked if it was their first time in and since it was, offered up complimentary drinks. It wasn't like they were busy when we came in, she was just very short and didn't feel like engaging with us. Maybe an off night for the staff and food, but I wouldn't be inclined to go back.Been here 3 times. I must admit it is not so great and over priced. The service lacks but they are open late. On a sunday night when I rip off a nail before a big dinner meeting, they are open for a quick fix. I give them props for the crazy late hours but there would be no reason to visit them otherwise.  Last resorts and emergencies only.I am not impressed. The place is quite very small for a Vegas nightclub. There were advertisement on free drinks. They fail to tell you that it's selective drinks... and although you have a bracelet to get in for free the bouncer tries to charge you. So booo!! me no like... bad service, small club, alright music, and drinks were poor.So the hotel is nice and new. The rooms are nice, modern. The pool is also great.

However, be prepared for the maid waking you up (IN VEGAS!!!) at 8am to try and clean the room, possibly also sleeping in your bed while your not there, and also waking you up again at 8am on your checkout date, taking your clothing off your bed and throwing it on the floor, etc. 

On top of this, you are far away from the strip and not really close to a highway that will get you close to the strip. Especially if you're climbing at Red Rocks, stay away from this place.

The ghetto hotels on the strip that you can find for $35 are much more worth it than this place. 

The only good thing was the pool was open till 8pm and the parking lot is close to the elevators to the rooms.Had a reservation since friday for 20ppl and they are not ready have no seats available. When I came to the desk the lady seemed confused looking at the computer and once I spoke of taking my company else where she said she could come up with something but didn't give a time of how long it would take... The waiter was better making sure we all got our food and drinks but at the end he could not remember who's bill was who's and what food goes on what bill. We stayed a hour before giving up n just paying whatever the ticket saidPositively the snobbiest Starbucks I've ever been to. Get over yourselves and crack a smile, for goodness sake!Let me preface this with the following: I realized ordering fish might be a risk at an establishment such as this, but the girl at the counter was raving about it so i thought i would give it a try. ~What a mistake!~ I took my meal to go, or I would have 100% talked to a manager about this experience.

The service was semi-friendly, it was late lunch time and they were busy but not crazy busy. I opted for the Salmon Caesar Salad (recommendation from the employee.) The salad consisted romaine lettuce (which was not "crispy" like noted on the menu,) capers, grated parmesan cheese, croutons (soggy) and caesar dressing (dressing was a decent flavor.) On top of the salad was the "Wild Alaska Salmon Fillet" which was super dry, had absolutely no seasoning and had a mild hint of freezer burn taste. It clearly was an older piece of fish that had been in the freezer for far to long. It was totally my fault for expecting far better but they definitely should have tossed that chunk of meat out long ago. On the brighter side, the bread served with the salad was really good & the iced tea was enjoyable too. 

Safe to say, stick to the bakery items (sandwiches & baked goods.) Definitely DO NOT ORDER THE "Wild Alaska Salmon Fillet Caesar Salad." Yuck!Meh, the Buffet was about on par with a standard college dormitory. The service was good but the selection and taste weren't really too good. The all you can drink beer was good, but that's the only plus in an otherwise mediocre buffet.Breakfast exploration fail. :(
I was really hoping to find a new breakfast spot while taking summer classes at the nearby college. Ronnie's is not the spot.
I ordered the waffle, eggs and bacon special and cup of coffee. The waffle was probably the only edible item. I requested my eggs over medium and received them over easy (fine not a problem) but the bacon was sooo limp, My guess it was microwaved. The coffee was probably the biggest disappointment, very weak and watered down. I sat at the bar to eat my food and could hear the servers gossip about the clients. I will continue to search for the breakfast spot because this place was not it.I went only once and got the katsu chicken and short ribs combo. Maybe it was a bad day, but the breading was falling off the chicken, and the chicken tasted funny. I haven't been back since.You get what you pay for. The beds were horrible and the bathroom not much better. There is parking (a little expensive--you would think that they would allow guest to park for free..) The only good thing about it was that it was close to everything, and that it was somewhate affordable.High prices for very average food. The signature $12 Margarita is not worth it.  The chicken for my fajitas was very dry.  My wife enjoyed her Tinga.Was ok, broth pretty good, tasty wings, but when I go they are CHEAP on the beef, like 4 wimpy slices, and charged $4 more for 4 more slices! Other times when I go with people who are regulars service and portions are great. Playing favorites at a restaurant isnt for me.Yuck.  Go to Maestro's instead, it's the real deal.The PF Changs of Thai food. There is nothing more to say. 

Also, it boasts the greasiest pad thai in all the land.Not what I expected. The food was nothing special, especially compared to other Fox restaurants. The restaurant itself is a nice place to go with a group of people. The margaritas and mojitos were alright, but there are definitely places to find better in the area. I was not crazy about the food either. 

Overall this is not a horrible restaurant by any means, I just went in expecting better food and drink. They do have outside seating which could make the ambiance much better for a larger group of people.I give Blanco 2 stars not because of the food, but because of the experience.  I have been there at least 4 times and have had mediocre service.  Why do I return?  Well, I love the White House Margarita, the chips and guac are wonderful.  But all of the teens in their super short cotton tennis dresses are lacking what it takes to make a dining experience receive 5 stars.   Most of my not so good experiences have been on the patio....it's as if they forgot I exist, until after they finish their chitter chatter amongst themselves.   I keep going back b/c I want Blanco to succeed, but one day, I will just give up if things stay marginal!literally the worst service all 3 times i have been.  i will not go back.  BUT, the food is good (if you don't have it served with a hair like I did once) and i know plenty of people who agree that if you are in no hurry and don't mind very slow service, that the cheap cost and food could be worth it.I remember this place having a decent breakfast but we hadn't been in a while. My husband and I decide to come on a Saturday morning. I'm not sure if they were ill prepared for this particular Saturday, or if this was the norm, but the service was disorganized, and almost nonexistent.
There was no one at the hostess station when we arrived. After about 2 minutes someone noticed us and seated us, but then brought no menus. A different server arrived about 10 min later and asked if we needed menus. I said yes, no one has been over yet. She asked if we just walked in and seated us ourselves and we said no, someone seated us here. So yet a third person arrived, to take our drink and food orders. She brought our water and coffee but we waited quite a long time for our food to arrive, and breakfast foods usually arrive very quickly so it seemed unusual. 
The kicker was that no one came back ever to check on us so when my husband wanted a refill on his coffee he had to get up and get it himself. During a Saturday morning breakfast service, I find this absurd. A coffee cup should never go empty, just like a water glass. 
Yes, the food was good, but as I've said before, I have food at home that I can cook myself. I pay money to eat out for the ambiance, convenience, and good service as well as the food. If service is poor I'm not going to bother going back for my time and money.This review is for the woman behind the USPS counter and not the pharmacy. The couple times I've dealt with the pharmacy they've been great. There is one USPS staff member however who is a total B.  It's hard to put your finger on exactly what it is that makes her so  - but to try, she is a smug know-it-all who just rubs me the wrong way. I don't usually review a place unless I have something nice to say, but I just couldn't let this one go.  In these tough economic times I'd prefer to see someone there who values their job enough to be kind to the patrons.9/23

Had a friend meet me here for Restaurant Week.  We both weren't dressed for the Phoenician, but I didn't care (and soon, he didn't either).  It's a good thing, too, bec. in the end, we found that this place wasn't ostentatious nor that pretentious.  Dressed casually, we still managed to have a good time, despite the overall lackluster dining experience.

First off, let me say that the service could pick up their heels a bit.  By the time we received our expensive alcoholic beverage choices, more than 20 minutes had elapsed.  ($15 for a glass of Cab and $11 for a tiny glass of mimosa?  Are you serious??)  Our first plate, a sub-par Caesar salad, arrived close to an hour after we were seated.  But perhaps the fault wasn't entirely J&G's... Digestif's Caesar salad pretty much demolished all other competitors, I'd say.  How about I testify that tonight's salad was crispy.  That's saying something nice, right?  No flavor, no creamy eggy goodness, but somewhat crispy.  The decimated croutons didn't help the situation...

For the entree, we had the skirt-steak & frites.  The latter weren't any better than what you would find at McDonalds'.  (Seriously, I'm not making this up.  Just check out the photos and you'll see I'm all about the truth!)  But the skirt steak!  This baby wasn't much to gaze at, but it was tasty.  Let's just say it was delicious enough for me not to cry over the expense we spent that night on a barely-touched salad, a cheap cut of steak, three beverages, and tip.  

Now onto the star of the show... chocolate cake w/ caramel ice cream!  Wait for it... homemade caramel ice cream!  And chocolate-lava cake shaped like a star.  Oh. My. Freakin'. God.  This should be renamed "Foreplay."  

Nice ambience, despite it being darker than I would like and that we were seated far away from the panoramic views.  I appreciated the privacy, though.  Women's restroom was clean and orderly, and walking past little caches of wine bottles was a nice touch.  The grounds looked pretty, but I was more impressed w/ the property at The Arizona Grand...Yuck! It's vegas and I wanted an eiffel tower drink but never again! I'll stick with Fat Tuesday. But if you want to get drunk within minutes, this drink definitely does the trick.

The drink itself is disgusting. I got the strawberry daquiri b/c I didn't want any tequila. But I mean the drink got me drunk within minutes but I felt like shit. Plus, it costs $16.99 for it. I almost would have rather paid for the eiffel tower and had Fat Tuesday filled it up instead. At least their alcohol doesn't get me feeling extremely shitty for the next two hours. Also, the alcohol wasn't even proportionally mixed in. The dude basically pour alcohol at the bottom of the cup and then filled the rest of the tower up with strawberry daiquiri. I ended up pouring the last 1/4 of my drink. I couldn't drink anymore of it.

Pass.

Come here if you want the cup. For the alcohol? go to fat tuesdays.The first time I came here, my server seemed like I was inconveniencing her with my order. The food was less than average and grossly overpriced. I hoped it was a fluke, so I went a second time and the people behind me in line were seated before me and my meal took an absurd amount of time to be served. I will not be returning to this restaurant.Sometimes this location is dramatically understaffed and the wait times can be really bad.  This same challenge can also seem to affect the quality of getting your order correct.

Nothing against Paradise Bakery - because truthfully I really love their locations in general, but this location is one of those that you should only visit because you have to.I was VERY disappointed in the food! ...and the amount of food provided for the price.  We barely had enough food to get over being hungry.  We took our food as take-out and also had a good portion of our food missing.  I would NOT go here if you have other options.Neo-Traditional British Bistro Cuisinie Meets American Dive Bar

First impressions - Very warm inside the restaurant, strong curry smell.

Loud unintelligible heavy bass "music" playing.
Feels more like a dive bar than an eatery.

Friendly, knowledgeable staff.
Good selection of beers.

Small tables and booths, definitely not designed with comfort in mind.
I can't say the music is bad, but very hard to understand because it's all bass and no treble - I think there are vocals...

The red wine sauce provided would be at home in a beef burgundy but for a cottage pie? Not so much. Cottage pie pasty was dry and lacked the Worcestershire sauce flavor one would expect. Basically just ground beef and mashed potatoes.

The crust was too crisp, dry and crumbly, not flaky. Had I been a Cornish miner, my lunch would have fallen in my lap upon the first bite.

That's not to say the pastry didn't taste good, but it crumbled upon first contact with a knife. Luckily I had a knife, fork, and plate as my filling needed to be scooped after any attempt to penetrate the crust.

The "Pilgrim" pasty came with a side of Stuffing....eh. The contents of the "Pilgrim" were less dry and tasted more like the intended turkey dinner than the cottage pie resemled its intended target dish. This dish came with cranberry sauce....eh. The red wine sauce went much better with this than it did with the other pasty.The owner, Roxanna, was more than helpful when color matching me for foundation;  however, I still don't think the color is correct.  I was rather peeved to see that she charged at least $5 more for EVERY item I bought than any other place I've seen. You are much better off buying your items somewhere else unless if you don't mind overpaying.I've never been a fan of the food here.  I do like the traditional chicken wings and enjoy the variety of flavors to choose from.

Today was not a good experience.  I ordered the blue cheese sirloin wrap (new item).  The wrap tasted too salty and it was very small for the price- about $12.  I wouldn't recommend that to anyone.  

The reason today for 2 stars was for the wait time.  It took too long to get our food.  I was getting so angry waiting.. I saw people who sat down 15 minutes after us get their orders first.  I was not happy at all.  

Kids meals are a joke here. Portion size for a kids meal should read 2-5 years old.  Beware-  they are small.  The slider kids meal came with an over cooked hard little burger.  Not the best.  They need to step up their burgers.

I was not brave enough to complain but the food here isn't the best.  I would stick to chicken wings and maybe nachos.  Or-  go somewhere else.Loved the atmosphere/decor, the service and the waitresses' aprons, but I can't say the same about the food.  Ordered the Eggs Benedict and the sum was not greater than the parts.  The dish desperately needed salting, the asparagus was uncooked and the "croissant" was dense and dry (not buttery or flaky).  Their french toast was nothing more than dry grilled challah bread topped with berries.  Bakery?  Good joke!We are from the south and know great barbecue. This barely passes.I came here because I was visiting a friend in Madison and we wanted to go to a place that had good food and a nice atmosphere. The Cannery seemed like a good choice contrary to the negative Yelp reviews. But, we should have listened to Yelp because above all else, the food was not good.

The service surprisingly was- I had no issues at all with it, and the host and our server were great. = One star given above

The atmosphere was nice, as was the convenient location = second star given

But some things were odd-
1. The empty dining room on a Saturday night....this place should be a little more crowded eh?

We shared the cheese curds to start, but honestly it's Wisconsin can anyone really mess those up?

Next, I had a cup of chicken noodle soup, the flavoring was very strange and I didn't really like it. Needed salt and less of whatever they put in it. 

For my meal I had the cajun chicken and shrimp pasta. THIS WAS NOT GOOD DO NOT GET IT. It was so spicy, and the chicken had a weird consistency, I'm really not sure if it was cooked. The sauce was gross too. 

The other people at my table were somewhat satisfied with their food but we won't be back unless it's just to drink or something. Def not for food aside from appetizers though.Oh American Apparel. I want to like you, but your smug employees and weird-fitting clothing just don't do it for me. And I can't help but notice the people who frequent the store take on this smug quality as well. 

Every single over-priced basic tee or tank I've purchased has fallen apart, stains easily and shrinks in odd ways after every wash. 

There are a couple exceptions: the basic u-neck tanks, v-neck tees and headbands. However, I can find better quality (and less expensive) garments at Target. 

Maybe if there was a sale every now and then I'd have a soft spot for American Apparel. This convention has yet to be introduced to this retailer.Aria is modern and pimp!  That's all I say about the structure

Dealers and workers:
They are super diks to people,,, they treat everyone like garbage...  I won't be surprised if this place gets no repeat business because I would never play here again...First (and lasting) imression:  Aria is the euro/clubby version of the other casinos.

The interior was not designed in traditional casino-form.  It looks much different than the other casinos on the strip in that it has much more a trendy/nightclub feel.  Even the Encore at the Wynn, a new hotel, still looks like an upscale casino, but Aria reminded me of a string of nightclubs and trendy bars with contemporary minimalist decorating.  The lighting is much darker than the other hotels, but the foot traffic in the casino was heavy and people were at the tables.  

The spa is gorgeous, but again, there weren't people utilizing the facility there, rather just walking through viewing- it is very well-decorated like some yoga retreat center.  The restaurants looked uninviting to families (dark, trendy, and each with a unique colored-glow) but probably appealing to a younger, single crowd.  Busiest areas in the hotel were the casino, the under 18-arcade, and the food-court-style dining options, as would be expected given the time of year and economic climate.1.5 Stars! 

Good
Nice bed and pillows.  
View was nice---facing Bellagio
Room was clean on day 1
Customer service...mixed... so/so at best.
Non smoking or gambling hotel.

Bad
1st... we were there to enjoy Las Vegas... and we did...so... not really hung up on the room but there were issues. 

Left room on day 2 @ 0700 requested the room be cleaned... back to the room at 1530 and no maid service... not cool. 
Broken phone
Fridge didn't cool
Shower pressure was almost like pouring out a bottle of water.. if that much pressure. Really low... made getting a shower a PITA! 
Overpowering potpourri smell in the entire hotel.
Iron was chained to the ironing board... 1st time I had seen this...even in low budget hotels I've never seen it.  Maybe there is an iron thief in the building? 
Noise from the room above... 
Electrical outlets did not work (3x)



Conclusion.... 
We will not stay at the Vdara  again...  it's touted as a upscale hotel but it's smoke and mirrors... it's a 3 star place.
 
If you are looking to stay at in a nice suite... smoke free and casino free...  spend the same money and go to the MGM Signature.  Much nicer suites, great staff... just a nicer place to stay.Good location with some poor housekeeping and service.   

Going back in 2013 the stocked toiletries were haphazard, randomly all shampoo and a shower gel, when I called down to fix it it took a while and they gave a jumbled amount of everything like they couldn't bother to give one of each?  I would understand if it were busy, but passing by an open room door with a maid cart parked in front of it you could see four maids sitting around chatting away.  Worried about things being clean after that and looking closer furnishings were dusty.  The furniture has not been well maintained and it's definitely not nice and shiny like when I went in 2010.

I booked the room cheap and that's the only reason it's not 1 star.We arrived about 3 hours before check-in (4pm), which I agree is a bit early to get there, but what can we say, it was a desirable flight time. I think 4pm is a little bit late for check in, most places are 3pm and you can get in around 2. They offered that we could go out to the pool, but lets be real, Scottsdale in August (117 degrees outside) does not exactly scream lets go to the pool where the water is a refreshing 90 degrees! So we asked if there was a room we could upgrade to that would be available ASAP, and the girl at the desk tells us that we are getting the only king bed available in the whole resort as it was. REALLY?!? 

   So we finally get checked in at 3:45 and head over to our room which was extremely spacious and nice and cool since the AC was at 75 degrees (I immediately cranked it down to its low end - 60 degrees) and threw our luggage in the closet. I went to shower and the only light over the tub is a heat light! Needless to say I opted to shave my legs in the dark. 

   On our second day there I realized there looked to be poop smeared on the back of our bathroom door. It wasn't a huge streak, nor was it blatantly obvious, or I think I would have noticed it immediately, however, I'm not sure what else would be on the bottom part of the back of a bathroom door that is brown. 

   The room was cleaned every day and we even got fresh towels, even though I kept folding ours and leaving them on the rack. We got twp bottles  of water every day which was nice. My biggest complaint: we're paying a $15 per day per room "resort" fee and they can't even put blackout curtains on the door in the bedroom. We had a nice jacuzzi out back, but it is now AZ state law that they can not have them filled and must keep the door that leads out to it locked because some girl drowned a few years back... So the locked door has blinds on it, but it is still bright as noon in there right after sunrise. Blackout curtains in the living room and on the windows in the bedroom, but NOT on the door? UUUGGGGGHHHHHH!This is the second time in a row that I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory, and the service sucked again!  The server did not check on our table of six even once.  We went for lunch on a weekday, and the entire meal took an hour and a half (some of us work and and some point need to go back!)  There were other tables that arrived and ordered after us, but ate and left before us, even though we had the same server.   Two of us in the group ordered a lunch salad and sandwich combo, but  substituted for an upgraded salad.  While the server said there "might be a small up-charge" for the difference, she ending up charging us an additional entree charge ($11) because she said that the difference for the two salads equals one entree so it was just easier for her to put in on the check that way.  WTF?  I've never heard of anything like that, and charging half the cost of an additional entree for a salad up-charge is ridiculous.  The customer service at this CF is non-existent.  I'm  giving two stars because the food is good, even though the employees are sub-par.For a name like camarones (shrimp in Spanish) you would think that the ceviche would be served with some cojones (explertive for strong or brave in Spanish) but instead the katsup flavored pansey shrimp dish fell short at best. I had a three item combo that was slathered with microwaved melted cheese. The chicken taco a chicken filled sopopillo and the adobada beef all tasted of chafer water. The taco and sopopillo chicken were identical and flavorless. The adobado was so broken down that it resembled ground beef. The only salvation to the dish was the delicious tortilla and the table salsa left over from the chips. No wonder this huge beautiful building is empty. The positive was that the wait staff was friendly And very attentive. I wont be wasting another cent in camarones until they get out of the catering business.I don't understand the hype.  Hubby and I came here thinking we were going to be wowed by the selection of stores and decor.  The place looks like a giant warehouse of high end stores with snooty sales clerks.  Parts of the place are completely empty so you have to walk for a while before you even see a store to go into.  Don't waste your time with this place, unless you want to be able to say that you were here.  You can find the same exact stores in several other hotels next door (e.g., Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, Venetian) and with better ambiance.I was disappointed with this place. I eat a lot of sushi and was not impressed. Part of the fun is the plating but itwas nothing to get excited about just rolls tossed onto a plate. The rolls were basic and not rolled tight. We had to ask for wasabi and ginger and the atmosphere was so loud due to the grill that we had to shout to talk.The only good thing was our server was so sweet but  I won't be going back.Interestingly, we had great anticipation for a great dinner.  Sadly, we had a server who was so aggressive that it really undermined the experience.  She was more suited to be the person you encounter at a car wash asking if you want your windshield fixed, your car waxed, your interior lathered... it was really annoying.  I love Cartwright's so we will give them another try and we had a wonderful experience at Tonto B&G earlier in the day.  Let's just remember the goal of creating a great customer experience.This place is like Jekyll & Hyde.  The drinks were good and the environment is good.  The outdoor seating area is large, and has a few televisions.  It seemed like a great place to watch a football game on a Saturday afternoon.

There were five seating areas outside that had televisions.  Only one was taken so we were off to a good start.  The first television we sat down in front of we were informed was broken.  After 15 minutes at the second one they came to the conclusion it could not be tuned to the correct channel, ESPN.

At the third we were able to get the game on.  We brought over food from BLT ordered some drinks and got comfortable for some football.  That is when the new issue started.  The bar back operating the televisions did not know how to operate their system.  Everytime he went to change the channel on one of the other television who changed the channel on our game.  This happened over a half dozen times.  We even missed a late fourth quarter touchdown.

Still a good place for drinks, but we now know not football games.I had a burger and it was disgusting...

the patty's looked premade and sat around for a long time...

I make a better burger FOR SURE!

totally not worth the priceI feel like this buffet was nothing too special which made me sad. The Aria is such a pretty hotel with other nice places to hang out and eat and this was just less than what I expected. I should've taken my 30something bucks and just gone back to the spa and brought a pastry from Jean Phillipe with me.
I was underwhelmed - the spread is not exciting at lunch. I guess I expected something new, special. This hotel buffet could have been in Vegas 5 years ago, and this hotel just opened last year.
The saving graces for me were three things: the fried rice - that was very good and not drenched in soy sauce or greasy; the cooked to order pasta bar, which was delicious; and the dessert table which was pretty and I had two creme brulee. 
I wouldn't come back here. Take a 20 minute walk over to Wicked Spoon.Exactly - "Meh. I've experienced better"
Take your money some place else, definitely was not worth it. Very average and mediocre buffet. 
Aria could do a lot better job than this.. pretty disappointing.
Nothing stood out for me, I'm not a crazy fanatic of crab legs, for all others i guess that would be the only highlight of the entire menu. 

Go next door to Cosmopolitan's Wicket Spoon Buffet.Decor is very modern. I like how it looks like noodles. They also had really pretty flower arrangements. The food was okay. I had the cashew chicken with steamed rice. The rice portion was huge, but it got cold quickly which I was a little disappointed about. The chicken was pretty flavorful. I would have liked more ginger in it. I would have loved to have hot tea with my meal but I couldn't get over the fact that they were trying to charge $4 for it. So, I stuck with water. I was more impressed with how everything looked than how it tasted.The burger was pretty good- the service was disappointing. Our waitress looked like a vegas dancer but had the attitude of a grumpy old bar maid. Tables are packed like sardines and the R&R music is great but a little too loud....the burger was tasty...the iced tea was cold:) The fries were meh...not very fresh & nothing to write home about.Really disappointing. This is really strange diner food for triple the price and smaller than expected portions. The food quality was not up to par with the prices and the menu items just sound better than they taste. 

I ordered a deep fried lasagna sandwich. That sounds totally awesome, right? Only if you like greasy, bready and bland. I also order the appetizer soft pretzel but it was dry and hard. Not my thing at all.  For the price there are so many better places to go.this place was basically empty when we went on thursday.  We had a restaurant.com coupon which is why we went.  I got the snapper which was delicous but the portion was tiny.  I should have been double the size for being $27.  It was a snack.  My husband got the Blackened skirt steak which was ok and portion was decent.  However, we probably wouldn't go back just because with the $25 coupon, it was $40+ tip with 1 drink and 2 entrees.  Although that's ok, I wouldn't have paid $70 for that meal.  My dish was too small for that price.I did not purchase my vehicle from this location, that was in the West Valley. Because I live closer to Gilbert than I do Avondale I sometimes take my car to get serviced here.

After setting my appointment for 8:30 and arriving 15 minutes early, I had hoped that my simple wheel change would've taken 45 minutes to an hour and I would be on my way home. I had planned the previous night and the following day around this one appointment. We dropped my car off and I watched as they parked it away from the service area. After eating at Paradise Bakery and shopping at San Tan Village, I called CARMAX at 11 to see how my car was doing. 

They told me I had enough time to catch a movie. Around 3:00 we made it back to the service station and saw that my car was in the exact location they had parked it when I dropped it off. Erica was great at explaining the situation and reassured me that the service department had been working on an overflow of services since yesterday and that my car would soon be worked on. Half an hour later I saw my car get taken into the shop and 45 minutes later I was driving home. 

Erica was extremely apologetic and offered me some 'goodwill' coupons which took $50 off the service. I never asked how long it was going to take so part of the blame is on me; but from a customer service standpoint I would assume that when you make an early appointment you expect a quick return. It would've been helpful if they had told me that it was going to take all day rather than me assuming when it would be done. 

I was livid by 3:00 but Erica helped ease the stress and frustration I felt. I only came here because they had ordered a replacement wheel and I didn't feel like wasting another day waiting for my car to be fixed. 

For the future, go to your neighborhood body shop. Support small business' and let the corporations work on their customer service.Service is SLOWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I understand new restaurants usually are slow when they first open but this place has made ZERO improvement in terms of speed. Expect to wait a long time for your food.

The food... it's a hit or miss. You have to find the items they make well. Pho is okay. The vietnamese dishes in general are decent. The Thai dishes are laughable though. Don't order the Thai food!I feel like I'm the only one who ate here outside of midnight to six!

The brains behind Flamingo took the hip Voga restaurant, kept the decor intact, hung some Miller Lite flags on the railing, hung some plasma TV's on the wall with sports, took the good booze out of the bar, added a couple of diner tables along a wall, and gave us Burger Joint.

Like most Flamingo restaurants, the prevalent attitude is "I don't care." Service is awful whether you're in the restaurant and bar. Food is good but not great. I had the Kobe beef on one visit and it was no more special than what you get at Jack In The Box. If they put some effort into this place it could be really fun, but I expect to see another half-assed concept in place next year instead. The only exception I've found to the Flamingo's awful service is Margaritaville and Sin City Brewing Co.

Go here for the cheap late-night specials. I'd be much more enthusiastic if my burger and fries were only $2 instead of $16 - $25 for the burger alone and an additional $4 for a side of fries.The fieldhouse is one of the most inconsistent places I've been. One week the service is great and the staff is attentive and the food is good and the next the service & the food is awful. 
Just a few days ago my roommate & I stopped in after work for happy hour & dinner. It took 15 min just for us to be acknowledged by the waitress and another 20 min to get our first drink & put in our order.  After 50 min we finally got our food, without silverware. Which took another 10 min for us to get. We were never offered a 2nd drink the rest of the time we were there until we requested the check. The food was not good & the service was even worse. I have gone on other occasions  later in the evening & the bartenders were great, but the atmosphere was ehhh. It actually seems like the "regulars" want to keep new people from coming in.
I will probably go back, because let's face it it's Gilbert,  and that's where other friends want to go from time to time, but I will be sure and not have very high expectations.Don't do it!! I should have left when the foul smell hit me before I made it to the door! The staff was not rude and the beer was cold and well priced but the lack of decent food, zero ambiance and stench will keep we from giving it another try.The food was great. It was a quick service. The cahier was nice except for the manager named Marivic Perez.  She was rude with her employees. She yelled one of her employee infront of the customer.  I mean that was not right. Be civilize Marivic!Stopped in by myself for lunch. The place is nice inside, but the back door was open and the whole restaurant smelled from the employees smoking by the back door. Service was adequate.

I had the chicken noodle Pho, which was serviceable. It came with a plate of the typical garnish, and there was the usual Siracha, fish sauce, and such on the table already.

I will give them another try, but with some friends.The food here is only slightly better than Denny's, but at resort prices.  My fried buffalo chicken sandwich was not fully cooked in the middle and the fried mac & cheese app was barley warm and a little soggy.  The kitchen staff seemed irritated that I sent the chicken back - they have an open kitchen so I could see the reaction of the chef when my waitress returned the chicken.

The restaurant was not busy on the Saturday afternoon that I visited, but the hostess was MIA when my party arrived.  We waited for about five minutes before I asked a server in the dinning room to get the hostess to seat my party and the party that had arrived before us.  Really not acceptable.  Our waitress, however, was very friendly and attentive.

I'm a local, so I won't be returning to Frank & Albert's; I think the only people that eat here are those staying at the resort, convenience is really the only reason to go here.Went for lunch a week ago with the same friend that found the place the first time.  None of te dishes were as good as our first visit we both agreed. 

It was still a very busy place though. The beverage girl/woman was a bit snobby and said something negative about her tip in Mandrian and much to her surprise I called her on it!  Which shocked the crap out of her - it was priceless!  Little did she know that my Ex is Chinese and spoke the language fluently and thus I picked up something!  That'll teacher to under estimate the knowledge of a sister from the PNW hood!  Haha!Grubbed here for the first time just a couple days ago. Lodged in a strip mall, and distinguished by red, claw-like font, 'Bangkok' seemed like a decent place to fill the tums.

A little reluctant to enter, the blinds were open just a tad, giving us a peek in. At 7:45pm, no patrons at all-- you might have assumed they were about to close. Assumption false though, when we tried the door, and slipped right in. We were greeted by two nice guys who happily allowed us to choose any of the 30/30 vacant tables. Thanks. 

The menu included all the common offerings found in most Thai places here, so I guess we played it safe by ordering the combo appetizer, combo seafood soup, pad thai, and thai bbq. Yes, a lot of food...the guy did not hesitate to remind us to "save space in your stomach"...Thanks again, guy. 

Combo appetizer was...alright. And by alright, I mean, their fishcakes were out of supply and had to be replaced by chicken satay (which was, not so succulent, but whatever). Other members of the combo appetizer were eggrolls (with very crispy wrapper, but minimal filling), crab puffs, and fried tofu. All pretty "OK" appets, accompanied by the usual sauces. Pad thai was underwhelming, and add to that, anemic. BBQ was, BBQ. The only somewhat tasty thing was the combination seafood soup--tom yum goong base, with fishes of the sea, sparse distribution of shrimp, and rough cuttlefish. Coconut ice cream did not hint any coconut, but rather shaved ice with coconut flavor. 

These eats, for roughly, $80. Really...80??? Yeah, that's what I keep asking myself. Most likely, will not return.The food was better than average.. Service was fine.. Beer was very overpriced and domestic beers like Sam Adams Boston Lager were included in the "Imports" menu for a premium price.  I mean a CAN of Tecate was $4.25. The bar takes up WAY too much space and the weird hostess kept walking around staring at everyone. I found the layout to be awkward and the place lacked the "fun" vibe. We ate our meal and left, having no desire to hang out for another round of overpriced drinks.Thursday is amateur open mic comedy night. Not sure if this is a new promotion or they've been doing it for a while but that was the thing that made my group of buddies want to go.

The comedy is open mic and preformed by amateur locals. The host is a drag queen who is just hilarious and isnt afraid to offend or pick on some of the average joes attending. 

The rest of the local comedians can range from 'please pass the mic' to 'omg did he just say that?' Definitely not for the faint of heart or for the easily offended. 

Starts at 10 ends at 12

The food was a bit disappointing. We all split an order of 50 wings in Spicy Garlic and Mild flavors. After about 45 minutes the host announced the comedy night special which offered 10 wings for 5 dollars any flavor. Kinda pissed our bartender didnt mention that nor did she mention any of the drink specials. We all could have saved some cash ordering less and been a lot happier with flavors we individually wanted.

The Spicy Garlic was neither spicy nor was it very garlicy it did have a pleasing flavor but nothing you would lable 'spicy' or 'garlic'

The mild didnt have sauce of any kind, Bartender explained that it's just deep fried wings tossed in butter. She offered to take it back to the kitchen to throw some medium sauce on it so we let her, when they came back semi tossed in sauce nostrils flared from the hot sauce/vinegar fumes. The bark was obviously worse then the bite. The medium had no bite. The sauce was so mild i didnt think it was any improvement from mild at all. 

In the future if i were to come back and order wings i'd request them to be naked and unbreaded. The breading is pretty thick and i cant remember tasting very much chicken at all.


Getting to the point. Hooters is the go to place for sports, beers, wings, and eyecandy in lots of other cities but in Las Vegas there's just so many other places that do the job better.No thank you.Dear Pink's,

  I hate you.  I had one in LA and it was ok but I was hoping for better...I'm not sure why I thought it would be better.  I think it's similar to when you see a McD's ad and you hope your burger looks like the ad but it's the same pile of crap every time.

  The chili was bland and the hot dog was not as good as Nathan's hot dogs.

  I'm pretty sure the chili dog meal looked the same entering and exiting my body!We decided to give the griddle a try this morning as our regular breakfast joint was busier than usual. This place just doesn't do it for me. The service is rather random as any of 3-4 people bring things to your table. The food is average at best: eggs were good, bacon limp and french toast thick but not very good. The decor is also kind of random with tables on top of each other and crowded with over-sized condiments. I don't anticipate a return visit.To be honest, the food was not so good.  The service was even worse.  It took 10 minutes for a waiter to come to our table after we sat down.  Great view of the strip.Wow, only 2.5 stars?? Ok.. I agree.

I hated how they split up the guys and girls into two different lines. It took us girls about 10 minutes to get into the club and our guys over 45 minutes and not to mention their cover was 40x more expensive than ours. Depending on the weekend, some paid up to $150 just to get in.  Look out for your guys and leave this club.

The dancers inside were not hot. It was just as crowded as Tao, but with less attractive looking creatures to stare at. The dancers and even the ladies in this one glass window looked over thirty years old with makeup caked on... I guess they don't discriminate. Thumbs up to them on that!

It's in a beautiful hotel, but just go shopping at the City Center. Forget this club.This place was a lot smaller then I expected and the music was bad. The mix didn't flow and they didn't play any music that's popular. I also found some if the workers running the guestlist to be rude. Not a club I will go back to nor recommend to anyone. The club Eve at the same hotel was WAY more fun!!Recently moved from Washington State and decided to go here with my mom.  We heard good things, so what the hell.  It couldn't be too bad, right?

Well...

We kept it simple and only ordered a few appetizers: fried egg rolls and chicken satay.

The egg rolls reminded me of what I would find in a cheap Chinese restaurant and the chicken satay was dry, tough, and overcooked.

I can only assume that people around here must not know what good Thai food tastes like.

We won't be back.This place is just awful!

It was about two years ago in 2010, when my family and my cousins family arrived in Las Vegas, looking for a bite to eat near the hotel we were staying at, and we found this place.

1st thing that sucked-We waited over an hour for our food and we were the only ones at the restaurant besides this other couple(who's food came before ours). 

2nd thing that sucked-My dad thought that they put too much dressing on his salad, so he asked if they could take the salad back, and instead of making a new salad, they added more lettuce which was ridiculous in this case.

So if your looking for a late lunch and your really hungry, do NOT come here.SEl Pollo Loco is great but this location is pretty hit or miss. I'd rate it 2.5 stars if I could but since I can not, 2 stars it is. 

On my last visit I ordered 2 of the 2 piece combo plates, with flour tortillas. Sweet potato fries and a salad were the sides I selected for myself, mac and cheese and rice for the husband. My husband loves these combo plates and has a whole routine down for eating it... He shreds the chicken and makes himself tacos with the tortillas and the rice which he always gets as one of his two sides. 

They forgot our orders of flour tortillas. No do-it-yourself tacos for my husband. Also the rice was undercooked and the mac and cheese was on the watery side. The chicken was still on point though... 

The Lake Mead location is more consistent so I will be going there from now on, even when I am closer to this location.I have been to get my phone fixed there twice. The repair was good although the customer service is horrible. I was always rushed when I was talked to. The guy I spoke with was always rude. I kept going because of the good work and low price. But the customer service has completely turned me off from going again to this business.Small, just small. No space on the floor to do non equipment workouts, closes early on weekends, not humid enough, I felt that painful cold air in my throat as I ran. Not enough space in the free weights section...maybe Its because I'm used to 24 hour fitness, but my workout didn't feel complete since I didn't get to relax my muscles in the sauna afterward.I went to Inkenstein a couple months back with friends who were getting tattooed by Jason. The shop itself is impressive and unique and I would give it 4 or 5 stars by itself. My friends are all pretty chatty (borderline noisy) and we were all excited for their first tattoos.. We didn't feel particulalry welcome.. Jason, was pretty short with us and cold towards the two of us guys in particular. It's a small place, so try not to bring too many people with you. I wouldn;t go to Jason for any tattoo, hoenstly, and it seems like he charges too much for the quality of work. But I plan on contacting Chris Bailey in the future. His work is really impressive and I still like the shop itself.I honestly don't understand why everyone rants and raves about this place.  It is a sub shop that is ran by unhelpful and rushed college kids.  They do not allow many choices and its kind of similar to in-and-out (regarding the atmosphere, not food).  They received 2 stars instead of 1 becaues they are very fast which is good if you are in a rush for lunch.Service was REALLY slow, even though we were the only people in the restaurant in the middle of a weekday. There were plenty of staff there, but they seemed to spend all their time chatting and folding napkins. 

Took forever to get our pizza: my friend had soup and salad and was done by the time the pizza arrived for our kids and me. Some of the pizza was barely warm, the rest was too hot to touch, and it was all dry and needed more cheese. 

Everything here is very expensive, even the $7 lunch special is a rip off when you add it up. The Algo Malo pizza is quite tasty, but costs an arm and a leg even for a small pizza.

The only thing that made this restaurant worthwhile was the children's play area. It has a table with trucks and toys, books, and even a projector and VCR with animated movies.This Pita Jungle was good. We went for the reverse happy hour. Well, what happened was we didn't know about the reverse happy hour until we got there. It starts at 9 and we got there at a little after 8. So we went for a walk around the neighborhood first to burn off some of those calories we were about to tack on and to kill some time. The walk was fun. The neighborhood is awesome. It doesn't feel like Phoenix at all. We even saw a big boat.

After the walk, we perused back over to the joint. I don't know if they had drink specials, we didn't drink that night. I had an iced tea and homemade lemonade. I think it's homemade. It tasted like it. I was impressed. I LOVE my Arnold Palmers. I would consider going there just for a big drink to go. I had the felafel, my husband had the chicken shwarma. The pita bread was a little hard and the felafel was a little dry. I don't know if maybe it was because it was the end of the night? We also had the hummus trio and the garlic dip. Both were delicious. But again, the pita bread was kind of dry. We couldn't decide which hummus we liked best. I think my vote is for the original. My husband was all over the tomato.

The service was pretty good, although she only came back to our table once. But again, that's probably because it was the end of the night, I think she was doing her side work. Luckily we didn't need anything. It was pretty busy for 9 oclock, I was surprised. We were no where near the last ones out of there. I don't know if we'll ever go back to Pita Jungle. I'd like another drink, but other than that, it didn't leave me craving more.O-V-E-R-R-A-T-E-D. 

Seriously? I mean, it was good for breakfast/brunch but it was NOT as amazing as everyone raves about. 

We waited about 45 minutes alongside every other person awake in Vegas at 9:00am on a Saturday. After we were finally seated (6 of us), we looked around at so many empty, clean tables! Very odd.

I ordered a scramble (came with a biscuit, melon slice, and potatoes) and the serving wasn't that incredible and I almost ate it all (I'm 110lb and petite). My potatoes weren't hot and my melon wasn't ripe. It just wasn't that impressive. The only thing I did enjoy was the coffee. Tasty coffee!

Overall--I would eat somewhere else or maybe visit the Hash House off the strip? Maybe Imperial Palace cramps its style.After eagerly anticipating this place, I was severely disappointing by the food.

On our way back home, we decided to stop by Hash House for a Sunday brunch. I already had eyed the menu online and had a good idea of what I wanted. I ordered the avocado, bacon, onion and cheese scramble (option #1 under Scrambles) per the suggestion of the waiter. 

When the dish arrived, the food was presented nicely on a huge plate. There was a generous serving of mashes potatoes, a biscuit and the scrambled eggs. The potatoes were very rich (read: full of cream and butter) and not hot at all. The biscuit was good but would've been better served warm. Now, the "star" of the plate - the eggs.

I hated the eggs with a passion. I took a few bites and I couldn't even any more. All I could taste was oil mixed with more butter mixed with cheese that was COLD. It wasn't seasoned at ALL and was basically a greasy puddle of room temperature oily eggs with bits of bacon. There was no texture in the eggs and it just tasted soggy and disgusting. *GROSS*

I paid way too much for a plate of oily, under seasoned food that was NOT EVEN WARM AT ALL.

+1 star for the zero wait time but maybe we should've just dealt with the long wait and gone to the Sahara location since I heard that place has better food.My wife delivered our daughter here last weekend.  After the delivery she wanted to see a lactation specialist to get started with the breast feeding process.  Her Dr. also submitted a request to have a Lactation specialist speak with her before we left the hospital.  Nurse after nurse kept telling us they were "too busy" and the specialist wouldn't be able to see us.  This happened on Sunday and Monday.  Understand that women are in a fragile state after giving birth, both mentally and physically.  The unfortunate circumstance is that the uncertainty of breast feeding and lack of direction caused for a very stressful time for the emotional first time mom.  
Had we known that lactation support would NOT be an option at this hospital, we would've sought consultation prior to my wife giving birth here.  The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because of the delivery nurse, Sandy.  She was exceptional.  My comment is only to assist future first time parents and allow them to properly prepare before having their expectations fall short.I only use the ATM at this branch. I have had bankers open accounts in the past without my knowledge and when I asked for the District Managers phone number, I was given an assistants name and number under the impression that she was the DM.  I understand bankers need to make their numbers but opening accounts without a customers consent so that you can make your "numbers" is illegal.Uggghhhh! Not only was te service cruddy but the food was crappy. Which makes me so sad cause Wendy's used to be great.....I need to just let go of the past yummy Wendy's days and move on. :-/The 1st thing I noticed about this place was the music.  Turned up to at least 60DB I could hardly hear the employee over the music - you'd think they were trying to cover up the sound of a lawnmower.  It took an extra 30 seconds to make sure my order was correct. I felt like I was deaf.  I would have asked to turn down the music - but the coffee came out quick and to my surprise was exactly how I ordered it.  It tasted good, and I will say I was impressed with DB as a company.  WOW that coffee woke me up with a JOLT.  I'd say 2x more caffeine than Starbucks and not as pretentious!  I will just have to find another DB on my route to work that isn't slapping me in the face with their elevator music.I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. This is the only Starbucks on my way to work, soooooo there you have it. The drivethru line is always time consuming, regardless of the time you get there, but the wait staff are super friendly and accommodating. They don't hesitate to give you a free drink if you've patiently waited in their queue. However, don't come here if you're already running late to work... come here if you have lots of time to kill and would like to win a free drink lotto.Renting here for the first 15 months was great! We had no problems until we tried to renew our lease for shorter than a year. When trying to renew it is $200 more expensive to do an 8 month lease, which is what we needed. The management recommended to sign a year lease and just pay a cancellation fee when we move, which would have cost us $1300. We have been good tenants and paid our rent every month on time but there wasn't anything they were willing to do. Rent from these guys if you are planning on staying for a while!I came in here today to have my grinding brakes looked at. My 2 stars are based solely on my customer service experience. I didn't let them work on my car.

Strike 1: A mechanic came in and said "Is that your Mustang?"  "Yes."  "Thought so. I'll tell the guys to stop making fun of it, har har."
Rude, unprofessional, not cool to say to a customer.

Strike 2: Presenting me with the repair bill and no explanation of anything, just a lot of "This is the EMERGENCY, BARE MINIMUM".  I did not appreciate being handed a $570 bill for just the front brakes and calipers, with no explanation whatsoever and a lot of high pressure "I just need the okay to get started" despite me repeating a few times that I needed to check out my financial situation first. 

Strike 3: Upon  telling the manager I would be taking the car elsewhere to get a second opinion, he launched into what I consider a tantrum. "SECOND OPINION? Second opinion? I gave you the cheapest price around. You won't get better. Grumble grumble, mumble."  Took off to the back without another word. I then had to wait a good 10 minutes for a mechanic to pull my car around... guess customer service drops off a cliff when the customer decides they might want to check other options out.

I took the car to Sun Devil Auto, who actually explained what was wrong with the brakes, told me I did NOT need new calipers, and that there was another more minor problem causing the wear on my brake pads. They didn't use high pressure sales, they didn't try to scare me with  words like "emergency", and the staff was all extremely nice.The only reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because the hotel room was nice. 

Other than that this place is a joke. The staff treated my wife and I like crap the whole time we were there. I am assuming because we are heavily tattooed they assumed we don't have money and there for aren't worth the courtesy of even small talk. Tried to ask some dealers questions about poker the first night we stayed and got the cold shoulder at first then a very nasty "We dont even have a poker room". 

I will not be staying here again.I originally transferred from 24 Hour Fitness off of Ann Rd, because I moved to the north side. I actually wish I never did.

My top 3 complainants about this gym:

1. Teenagers are EVERYWHERE!!! 
Don't plan to get a good workout during the summer time when they are out of school. All they do is work out in groups of like 5 and sit on the equipment all day. 

2. Equipment is terrible and old.
Most of the Free Motion Machine equipment is either missing the proper attachment handles or rigged together in an unsafe manner. This is actually embarrassing, especially when the gym charges you a yearly monthly maintenance fee...what a joke.

3. The dirtiest locker room I've every experienced.
If you like to change in a dirt locker room with trash all over the place, then this is the spot for you.

Bottom line, if you can treat yourself, spend the extra money and go to 24 Hour Fitness off of Ann. Military, I would just go the Warrior Fitness Center on base...for real!I've only been here twice. My first visit here was wonderful. The person who cut my son's hair was fabulous. Had I written a review then, I would've given 5 stars. This visit, however, is a different story. I give it zero stars, but I don't think that's fair because I didn't post a review last time. So 2 stars would be about the average. 

Anyway, this experience was awful. Maybe I should've figured something was up when the customers in front of me all told this one hairdresser they were waiting for someone else to cut their hair. I should've done the same. I told her I wanted a fo hawk for My son, so keep it long at the top. I sat down and saw her cutting the top. I was fuming in the waiting area, but the damage was already done. When she was done, I asked her why she cut it because I wanted it long at the top. She said his hair wasn't that long so that is why she trimmed it. What?! That doesn't even make sense. Whatever, I just brushed her off as an idiot, but I noticed that she had also cut my son behind his ear. I pointed it out and she said it looks like a scissors had done it and she used dull clippers. I told her that it couldn't have happened before this and that it is fresh because it is bleeding. She then takes out her clippers to show me that it is dull. I ask her, "So you are denying that you did it? It's fresh and bleeding." She stands there and says well if I did do it, then I'm sorry, but he was squirming. She seriously blamed it on him! I was livid. I had to ask her to give me something to clean it because she was just standing there. Ughhhh! I'm never going back to her again. I'm debating whether I should return to the location again because of this experience. I might just drive a mile further to get my son a haircut where his skin won't be broken and he will get a haircut that I actually requested.Food was good but not great.  For the prices, the food should be amazing.  However, they did have tasty pretzel bread.  But def not planning to go back.Is anyone else falling victim to the endemic "bitchy girl behind the counter" syndrome? Every time I shop here, I promise myself NEVER AGAIN. And every time I return here, I am reminded why. Only want to pay $20 for a shirt/dress/blazer? Then this is your spot. Only want to wear it once before it falls apart? You guessed it, then this is your place. Cheap and affordable clothes, but VERY poor quality. I don't know what's worse: the quality of the clothes or the quality of the customer service. The lack of a return policy is frustrating also. If you want to return something, you may only get store credit towards other poorly made garments. So alas, I am here with $30 in store credit. I will redeem it eventually, but I will not let myself return to this store. I'd rather brave the mall and head to Forever 21, which has a bit higher quality and more of a selection.The service at this location is really, really slow. I stopped here for a quick drink on the way home. They have tons of drink selections and syrups, even some sweetened with splenda. Unfortunately, my vanilla coke was flat. Great tater tots though.THIS PLACE SUCKS

The food was cold and overcooked. I'll never be back. A waste of 7 hard earned dollars.  Should have asked for my money back. 

Stay awayWe usually eat here once a week and prior till today everything has been great. We place our orders online and have had no problems. 

Tonight we placed our usual order at 6:30 pm for pick up at 7pm. My husband went in and stood by the phone/internet order line like normal but today the cashier continued to take everyone in the regular line. After finishing the orders for about 4 other families that arrived after him, she then asked if my husband needed something. He said we made an online order and she said ok I have it right here on the counter and will now place the order. Why was it not placed when it came through? We didn't receive our order that was placed at 6:30 until 7:30 because it was not placed by the cashier properly. We are assuming she was new and did not know the process but please correct this so it doesn't occur again. Thank you!I was excited to try this place but the food just wasn't that good. Trust me, I really want to like this place. With that said, it's a fun pub and we went back for beers again. They do have really good service but the food is overpriced and terribly mediocre. Also, basic beers are at least $10 a pint, I know this is Vegas but c'mon! A Fat Tire is $12? You gotta be kiddin' me.This review is specifically about the food. I haven't been here for any drinking or shows, so I can't say how that would be. The food is another story. I ordered a pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni, an order of wings, and a cheeseburger with fries. Placed the order and got there in 20 minutes. Took the food to work and the horror began. 

The pizza was cold as shit by the time I ate it, and the flavor wasn't very good. The worst part was the mushrooms! They were literally black and hard, and I couldn't tell if that's how they were supposed to be or if they were just old and rotten. Gross gross gross! 

The cheeseburger was very small, but the meat was good. Not much flavor but it tasted fresh. Fries were another story. They were cold and soggy, the worst things that can happen to fries. I ate three of them and threw them in the garbage where they belong. 

Wings are the reason they don't get one star. They were actually tasty, and the ranch wasn't that bad. They were also still warm. 

All in all, I would say this is a great place for drinking and catching live music, but the food isn't too good. Hopefully improvements can be made.I went to this store for three items and they only had one out of the three. If I can't get coconut aminos and coconut flour from whole foods then where am I supposed to get them? I ended up walking out without the almond flour because I can get that anywhere and it was a few dollars more at Whole Foods. Either way, this store is smaller than most Whole Foods stores and apparently it doesn't carry a lot of the same items.

The fresh food selection is not up to par either. If you want a typical Whole Foods experience you should probably go to the Town Square location or the Summerlin location.Came here not too long ago, and my first impressions were good! It has a great design and quite a cosy place. However, the major downpoint is fairly expensive drinks and bad service! The staff insist on table service, which is okay, but not when you're waiting for the bartender to finish their dinner so you get asked if you want another one. I felt like I was waiting for ages, trying to make eyecontact with the waitress. Also, when a party has already started a dinner bill (I wasn't eating though) it gets complicated when you get the massive bill at the end! 
They should have a system like this: 

- go up to bar
-order drink
-pay for drink
-take drink to table, or allow them to take drink to you (if they really want!) 

Voila! That in itself would easily notch this place up a couple points.This place has a few superlatives going for it. It's got a great selection. The prices seem pretty darn good too. And while those two things go far in my book, it's one last superlative that really gets under my skin:

The customer service is atrocious. 

I think because the workers know that people will always love imbibing alcohol, and that they have a great selection, then they don't have to actually work more than necessary and certainly not have to care about customer service at all. 

I find it odd that many of the floor workers didn't make any eye contact. I prefer to shop alone until I'm ready but when I am, I'd like to be able to find someone easily. 

It seemed that when I was there, the only one who had help was the lady who had a large party that required cases and cases. 

And don't even get me started with the cashiers. A skinny blonde woman was snooty  and short with me when I asked about buying a wine crate. Sorry. Did I bother her by asking her to do her job? And the cashiers closed and opened registers at will as if there were no customers waiting. Maybe her blood sugar was getting low and she was in danger of actually avoiding diabetes. No ma'am, please take that Twinkie break lest you fall below the obese categorization. 

I guess people will always need to get their drink on. But I'm sure this place could find people who actually know how to provide customer service. I mean if BevMo! can do better, why can't TWM? 

I guess I should only come there drunk so I won't care about the zombies collecting a paycheck.You can find this company's products at several retail stores throughout Madison and also at their booth at the summer Farmer's Market. The donuts are always moist and very tasty. The cookies are hit an dmiss--some days they are the perfect combination of being chewy in the middle and crunchy on the outsides. The scones are far too dry for my taste, and the other products look and taste mass-produced. Where is the love?!Yay: The outdoor bar is cute, although 105 degrees and humid prohibits actually *sitting* outside and enjoying a drink.

Yay: Despite the uber-bitchy hostess, we were actually able to get seated on a Friday night at 8 pm right away, although there were inklings of staff resistance.

Yay: Very cute decor.

Boo: It's eight hundred degrees outside, and you know what? When you're a cheap ass with the AC, it's eight hundred degrees INSIDE too.

Boo: The thai spring rolls are like nothing I've ever had, and not in a good way. Kind of cold and flaccid, yet sticky, and filled with little white noodles. Huh? No. Even if it tasted good, it's too close to fellating a cadaver for my taste.

Boo: NO substitutions. NO sauce on the side. Especially -- according to the wide eyed server -- because the owner was there that night. I do not give a rat's ass. I am the customer. If I want a side of sauce, who the hell cares? Pretentious jackass.

Boo/Yay: I am picky about curry. I like it very very very thick, which Fate's was. However, it was actually quite flavorless, a surprise given that the empty takeout container stunk my kitchen up so bad you'd think it would have flavor for days. The tofu was good, though, crispy and not gooey.

Boo: Service? Sucked out loud, especially after we got our entrees. Literally abandoned, we had to get up and actually get a server, any server, so we could get takeaway boxes and the check. The same server never came by twice.

So, you have mediocre food and a staff with the deadly combination of clueless and pretentious. No thank you. I know everyone seems to love Fate, and I wanted to too, but we will not be back.Despite all of the "glowing" (insert sarcasm) reviews about this place, some friends and I decided that this would be a great spot for happy hour.  Just as I was told, I saw a drug deal going down within my first 5 minutes of being there, at 5:30 PM.  There were lots of blue collar workers just getting off work and relaxing.  Everyone seemed to just be enjoying their Friday night.  Some other reviewers said they didn't exactly feel safe, but I felt pretty safe, however I did have a large group of guys with me.  The drinks were cheap, darts were fun.  The clientel was not my favorite, karaoke SUCKED...the PA system was awful and kept cutting out and almost everyone there wanted to sing R&B or rap...nothing against the two, I just like some variety in my ear-splitting karaoke.  Oh, and the folding table covered by a tent smoking area was pure class all the way.  I appreciate the experience but don't think I'll be going back.  I love dives, just not this one.Nice looking place ... food wasn't bad ... just something I didn't like ... not sure what ... sorry for the horrible review.This is one of the few locations with the brand new Pico Sure laser.

Had my first treatment in Sacramento and was driving through Phoenix and for my second treatment here.

It was very very low cost since they introduced a new pricing based on size. Mine was slightly bigger than the smallest but I paid under $50 anyways. Which is why I gave it an extra star. But you get what you pay for =[

After the blistering went away I saw 2 quarter inch long DEEP maybe 1/8 deep holes on two spots on the tattoo. On the black shading. It freaked me out but I forgot about since I thought it healed fine , (and it's on my back so I can't see it too well)

 - but now 6 weeks later I went to someone very experienced and he refused to treat me for another 4 weeks at least - apparently the technician wasn't experienced, or went too hard at the treatment, and those two spots are scarred. So once I remove the tattoo there will be a scar - not to mention I'm terrified to keep going with treatment on an existing scar. It's still rough 6 weeks later and not healed.

 don't go here for tattoo removal because their technician knows not what she does. :( :(I read several reviews and noticed a pattern, the highest reviews  came from those with a nostalgic history with this valley institution. Having lived in the valley for most of my life I appreciate the sentimentality.  

BUT!  It is important to separate nostalgia from reality, especially when others rely on your opinion when making dinner plans.

I've lived in the Valley for a good long time- more than 40 years.  I've been to Jordan's more times than I can count.  

As a child, this was one of many local Mexican food restaurants we visited- others being El Maya, Don Jose's, Rosa's, Rosita's, George's Ole, and others.  As an adult, part of my enjoyment was the old-fashioned, retro atmosphere- the genuine Naugahyde seats, dark wrought iron, old-school environment.  I was even OK with the smooth taco sauce in lieu of chopped and chunky salsa.  I tend to stick with the old-school combo plate- taco, enchilada, tostada type combos when I visit.

My last two visits have occurred in the last year- most recently in November.  The experiences were almost identical- disappointing.  It was as if someone in the kitchen had just given up.  The taco meat was not really seasoned, very bland, and the shell tasted as if they went and picked up a package at the grocery instead of making their own.  The enchilada was rather oily.  Food was warm, not hot.  Service was friendly but scarce- my drink sat empty more than once.

The visit in November is likely my last.  I drive by this location at least 3 times a week, and remember wistfully the days when the the food was piping hot, shredded beef well seasoned and the entire taco fresh out of the cooker- crispy and delicious.   There are too many good Mexican food places in town, and even for the memories that walking into this places conjures up, I cannot see myself coming back anytime soon.  I'll keep my eyes open for an upturn in Yelp reviews, particularly from those who are trying it for the first time.

As another reviewer said- be forewarned.  You run a great risk of being disappointed.I was really excited about Moto, so my Mom and I checked it out.

Bleh. 

The sushi was just not good... not like stinky-ew-terrible, but mediocre. Our server was pretty young and confused about the whole serving profession.

I give it two stars because I can see myself cruising to the bar for a midday beer and chowing down on some edamame, as it's a really neat area.Yeah, that was a $15 breakfast, that felt like a 6.99 breakfast. I have nostalgic feelings toward 5 & diner, so I'll probably still go here from time to time, but really it's not that good. 

I got an omelet that wasn't very memorable, the juke box ate our quarters.15 minutes to make an egg salad sandwich with only 4 orders ahead of me? When I open my bag, there is only half a sandwich? WTF? I go back and they acknowledge the mistake and proceed to make a half sandwich with and old piece of bread that was likely left over from lunch 5 hours prior.

There are too many places in this area to mess up that bad on a simple sandwich order to go back and try it again.The line moved fast. The food looked fresh. The menu is ample. The child menu is short and fare priced. The sandwiches are a lot better priced than Chompies. I had the honey-baked-ham sandwich. I know it's a Jewish deli for the most part but if you offer it make it good okay. It was alright. the ham was thin sliced and tasty, the bun however was not so good and the lettuce not so crisp. My friend had a chef salad and well it did not look very fresh either, the cheese was sort of melting back together though it had cute little cut out shapes. The lettuce not so crisp once again. The child with us seemed to enjoy the kid serving of Mac and cheese and was able to finish it. So the portion size was good for a 6 yo. 
I did notice that a lot of people seemed to not eat all or any of the bread or bun their meal was on so though I'm picky, it appears to be a fair assessment that there is an issue with all the bread other than the rye. 
Oh and the fact that a kids meal comes with soda is an issue, you have to pay more to give your kid a milk! That astonished me. So much for healthy America. Kid's meal comes with a cookie, French fries (yes with mac & cheese) and pop. I feel the children getting fatter reading the menu. So this Saturday lunch snatched $25 from us for a Chef salad from like two days ago, a ham sandwich on 2 day old bread and a fatten up you child kid's meal with milk and one adult small soda. Would have had a better sandwich and salad at Subway for a lot less. But I suppose if you try something else on the menu it might be worth the visit.Why is it most Food City's seem to be hanging on by a thread? This location is certainly no exception. The employees definitely get an A for effort though. But overall this is just like any other Food City. The typical regular homeless boozer hanging around outside, begging for cash. And the typical dysfunctional low income family that blocks an entire aisle. And don't forget the fact that 2 out of three Pepsi vending machines are broken and vandalized.Let me start by writing that the service was good, the waitress was prompt and attentive to the two of us. We were seated in a small room with 5 tables which was fine except that it was stuffy and a good look around the outdated room revealed a great deal of dust on rails etc. this of course makes you ask . What is the cleanliness in the kitchen? We had the tamales which was  dry and the fois gras which was good. The squash was excellent and the spinach salad was excellent but way overdressed. We also had the lobster and basil pasta, the lobster was chewy and the pasta had good flavor but vastly overdressed with oil or butter. My lamb was very good, except that lighting a rosemary twig for no purpose except to fill the room with smoke, is very unappealing and choking , especially when most diners have that dish. How is it a good idea to smoke people out? I think it takes away from he dish. Just put fresh rosemary on the plate , would be much more aromatic. The wine list is extensive and way overpriced( 300% mark up on some wines is unacceptable). I also think a water bottle should be opened at the table and not brought open to the table , makes me wonder .
I would also note that the food plates arrived quickly( which is good) although spending $360.00 and being out of there in 90 minutes can leave one wondering what just happened.
Overall, it is not on my return list.I really want this place to be good.  I love seafood and it's only 2 or 3 blocks from where I live.  I've been twice now, and both times it's just been... meh.  It's not bad, but I have no intention of going back.  The plates seem expensive for a joint like this. The chips were too thick. The salsa wasn't that great. And most importantly my fillets haven't been very delicious.  Maybe their shellfish and meats are different, but the fish fillets just aren't worth it.

The staff is friendly enough, and the service is quick enough, but I don't think I'll be swinging by here again.Pruitts asked me to email them to allow them an opportunity to make it right. So i did. Haven't heard anything else back.Portions are huge but not high quality. Atmosphere is very dated. Spicy wings are too spicy.I came in upon a friend's recommendation for my annual check up. It was the basic drill. Check in, paperwork, wait, pee in a cup, wait, see the nurse for vitals, undress, wait, see doc, dress, blood work, pay, reschedule. Clearly, those are a lot of steps with different people in different rooms of the office. The problem is that no one bothers to tell you where to go or what to do next. If you are brand new to the office, you better buck up and figure it out yourself. Don't bother asking for help. Asking questions only irritates the staff and they aren't shy to show you that they think you are stupid for not knowing their exact urine sample procedures. Grrrr!

So the doctor was nice enough...no complaints on that front.  The girls in the blood lab were really the only people with any personality, compassion or care at all.   I ended up getting a follow up call on the blood work that turned out to be nothing thankfully. However, I was appalled at the process. They left and abrupt, alarming and very vague voice mail. When I called back, I got lost in their automated system and then put on hold for an eternity. They finally asked me who had called me...needed the name of the nurse. I was like..."I don't know. Can't you look me up?  Don't you have a computer?". After much haggling  I finally spoke to someone who could tell me what was wrong with me. Well, that's an overstatement.  I asked a couple of elementary questions and the lady couldn't answer a thing and recommended that  I go to WebMD to get answers. Really? 

So, I came back for a follow up visit, hoping the experience would be more pleasant. It wasn't as bad, but certainly substandard.  Coming to the lady-doctor isn't my favorite thing to do. It's not comfortable or enjoyable. A good practice in my opinion would compensate with outstanding customer service. Cornerstone could use a little...er a lot...of training in the way of customer service.Update:

I don't mind $8.5 for wings as that is about average for a dozen wings. But when I get them and there are only 6, I'm never coming back to your restaurant. $17 for a dozen buffalo wings? HA! What the hell are you guys thinking?It's an airport......

The taxi guys were nice though.The Farm at South Mountain is beautiful and a real gem of the Valley.
But the restaurants are FAR to expensive to even bother trying the food!
A sandwich at the Farm Kitchen can cost you no less than $10!! And that is all you get for the price-a sandwich, not even a pickle on the side!

The small treats, like bars, muffins, etc. are expensive as well.

So...to really enjoy the beautiful landscape, pack a picnic and walk around the property. They have a beautiful shaded picnic table area, large garden, and artists' cottages. 

It really is a great place to experience actual greenery and you can make your time there even better by preparing a picnic to enjoy!I have to agree with you Sarah. I question why I still go here even after everytime I leave my car is scratched up. Sure it's cleaner than when I brought it in, but not as clean as it should be. 
I'm too lazy to wash my own car too.So I tried this place... Gave it a couple chances... But everything just seems off. Usually wrong ingredients in items... Or the food just tasting off. Yeah I really haven't been back and even though I drive by it I usually go home and cook myself... Good thing my mom taught me!The store is ok but dont think we will be back. The stock was limited and items werent marked nor did they have prices (or the prices were confusing). Save a trip and visit Reefmonsters or The Pet Shop, which are both in the same general area.Shame on me for going to a chain Italian joint, but we were in the area and soup salad and breadsticks sounded good.  I have not been to an Olive Garden for maybe 7 or so years, and WOW have they gone downhill.  

Food is ok, not good.   Service was poor at best.  Waited for drinks, waited for food, waited for check much much longer than we should have.  

Learned my lesson and will not be going back (to this location anyway.)In Phoenix, there are essentially 3 types of Indian restaurants. None of the restaurants in the valley can compare to good ones in real cities but there are some good ones: Royal Taj, Guru Palace, Dehli Palace. Then there are tolerable ones: India Palace, Tandoori Times, Indian Paradise and then there is everything else (places you shouldn't go to).  India Gate is one of these places.

I'm Indian and we tend to be picky about which Indian restaurants we eat at. Just like you wont find a Sicilian at the Olive Garden, yoy won't find a Desi at India Gate unless they work at Intel and are too lazy to drive to a decent restaurant.This used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant in the EV now it's a great shame. Menu has changed slightly but the quality is on serious decline!We were driving through town and chose this place based on other Yelp reviews and this is really the first time a highly rated dive didn't pan out for us.  

First the good:
- Very friendly and attentive service:  never had our water/drink glasses empty
- If you are a sports fan, they have 2 TVs and were showing different NFL games when we went there (Sunday lunchtime)
- The portions are definitely generous.

Now the average:
- The pricing really isn't that good to be honest.  For a family of 4 we paid $50 and didn't order any adult beverages or appetizers.  Frankly we can pay that in Scottsdale.
- While the service was very attentive, the food took a little time to come out, and it wasn't super busy in the restaurant.  It wasn't a major flaw, but I did find myself wondering where the food was for a little while.

Now the poor:
- The food...just not good at all.  I found the refried beans to not be fresh or tasty.  Really seemed store bought to me.
- The sour cream tasted awful.  I had to scrape it off my food.
- The guacamole was mediocre at best - again seemed store bought.  My 11-year old daughter's guacamole blows this away!
- The chicken seemed very low quality...definitely dark meat.  It was seasoned fairly well, probably because of the low quality.

The decor is dated, but honestly that wasn't an issue for us.  Most of the time dives like this with high Yelp ratings have some of the best food...just not in this case.  I really like to support local businesses, but unfortunately this is not a place I'd try again.  Sorry.Perhaps it was the busiest day of the year but the service was horrible. 12 minutes before anyone even came to our table and beverages were always empty. 

The sushi was just okay. Feels like due to thanksgiving, shipping fresh fish was backed up. The salmon was mushy and the flavor was light.Sitting out by the pool today and it sucked. I had to ask for a server, and then the one we got couldn't answer a single question about the menu. The food was horrible and took 45 minutes. Not pleased at all.Walmarts over the years has been either hit or miss I believe for many of us. 

The way they've treated their employees in the past (I hope it's in the past) is a negative they still haven't figured out how to extract themselves. That said, this is probably the largest and nicest Walmart we've ever been in! 

We normally go to Fry's on Shea and a few other local stores during the week. Walmart is saved for a special trip for a particular item or two. 

The meat department seems very large, but as Jason B. has pointed out the selection is limited. It is mostly well known brands that have prepackage their meats and some limited butcher cuts. 

The produce selection is very large and fresh. The canned goods selection is equally large. 

They have a TV and electronics section worthy of being a small Best Buys alternative and the prices are good. 

For us, the major drawback is the fact that it's a Walmarts -- which to us means, basic.  Basic, nothing flashy. In some ways this Walmart is so large and well stocked it is hard to differentiate it from the Sam's Club nearby. 

That is why we also go to Target, which is nearby and has recently opened a small deli meats and refrigerated section.

In the end, you are either a Walmarts type, or Target type; Sam's Club type, or Costco type -- and, we are in the later and not the former group.  

Sorry!Mimi's is one of those restaurants that you want to like more.

I say that because the execution is somewhat lacking.  We have been coming here, on and off, for five years now.  It's the coupons in the Sunday paper, or the email club that draw us in.  The pictures of the food look really good. But it's just, okay.  

One piece of advice for management would be to ease up on the salt.  Neither of us have sodium issues, but we would suspect that after coming here enough we would.  The gravy or sauce on our last visit was so bad, we were scrapping it off the food.

Also, time moves more slowing at Mimi's.  Maybe it's the lack of exterior windows, but it feels like I'm in a casino buffet room.  It's could also be the somewhat older crowd, who just sits, chats and just drinks coffee.   I do not believe it's the staff's fault, they seem to hustle around the place refilling drinks, etc. But, it would be hard to tell what time of day it is here.

Sorry!Wow!? Where to start?. Almost 10 years in invisalign, which I wore religiously, including 6 months of metal braces, during my last 2 years of treatment. After my first consultation, Dr. Brigham   told me 2-3 years in invisalign!  I finally had the upper retainer attached less than 3 months ago and was discharged, when the metal retainer snapped in half. Was told by Dr. Brigham that he "had never seen that happen before"! So what does he do? No problem I 'll just charge you almost $800 to straighten the misaligned tooth and redo the retainer that was either defective or installed improperly!!?? I can not believe it, after 10 years of visits 1 to 2 times a month, and he won't warranty his work past 3 months? I can understand if the band broke 1 to 2 years later, but not 3 months. I am disappointed. I guess he makes his money when you have to come back 3 times a year to have repairs done. I expected better and wish I just had regular braces in the begining, then I would have been done in 2005 and not have to deal with this headache! Thanks Dr. B!I have been going to AZ Mills because it has a store that I like to shop in - the Arizona Territory store, which has lots of cute stuff.  Since I live in New Mexico, a lot of their merchandise is similar to that I would find in Albuquerque, but haven't been able to find at all.  So I go there to buy certain items.

Found out last night that a couple of the things that I buy at AZ Mills are available at Fry's---much less expensively!  I don't think I'll be going to AZ Mills any more.What a letdown! Last Friday night, me and my family wanted to go out for pizza, we decided on Nello's because we haven't been there in YEARS. The waitress took our order right away, we ordered the cheesey garlic toast, house salad (no olives), and a thin crust cheese pizza. The garlic bread was so good, was the only thing I actually enjoyed. The salad came out and was missing all of the meat, it was just yellowed iceberg lettuce, carrot shavings, and a scant amount of cheese. We asked the waitress about the missing meat and she said she would bring it... it never came. The pizza arrived and was horridly undercooked, the cheese wasn't even melted in the middle! At this point i was just done, and super sad for my dining experience. We asked for our check and it took (no exaggeration) 13 minutes to get it. With two young kids this felt like ETERNITY.  She dropped it off finnaalllyy and we paid with a card. While all of this was happening there was either a regular or a local celebrity that was seated near us with his huge family. So instead of running our card she took their drink order, gave them their drinks, then took their food order... brought out their appetizer AND THEN RAN MY CARD. Shoot!!! took us close to 30 minutes just to receive our check, pay, and leave. Totally unacceptable, we will not be going back here :( The food was not that great, and the service was bad, not how i like spending my friday night.This is unfortunate. On paper, it's all good. A family owned store with a large selection of fish. The problem is the customer service is usually terrible.

I have been there four times. I will admit that one of those times, I happened to get a really helpful employee that surprised me with good service. The other three times, it was so bad, I give up.

During the three poor visits, no one offered to help. It wasn't like the store was busy. I usually have to go to the cash register where the employees are usually socializing and ask for help in the fish department. The the help you get there is terrible. It's as if you are bothering them.

The ironic thing is that these employees seem to really know fish well.

On my most recent visit, I watched another customer ask for help after what seemed to be an inappropriately long wait. I think he was bothered by the employees socializing nearby and not offering to help. It didn't surprise me.

Bottom line, I wish this store was better. It has the groundwork but the employees are poorly chosen and/or completely uninterested in their  job.

Unless I have some special need, I will be shopping elsewhere.I went in tonight for a beer and to take some food home. I sat at the bar for literally around 5 minutes (it felt like 15) without being greeted. The bar tender (a white guy with a beard, wearing a hat backwards, and a bit of a beer belly) actually walked by, and noticed, me 3 times as well. After the second time I said to myself, "okay, if he walks by again and doesn't at least say something like, "hey man, I'll be with you in a minute," then I'm out." The third time he actually grabbed a glass from right in front of me, but said nothing. So I rolled out. That seemed like a very clear message that he wasn't interested in my business.

Maybe I'll go back, but a place that hires people that can't be dependable for very simple customer service makes me very weary. If the guy couldn't take 10 seconds to smile and say, "be right with you" can I really trust he's washing his hands after going to the restroom and then making people's drinks? It shows a general lack of concern/respect for the customer. Can't trust it. Especially not when it comes to food and drink.After a late flight in, my wife and I wanted to get a quick bite and a drink before going home. We had 3 choices. Chili's was crowded, Applebee's was packed, so we went to Fridays that was not crowded at all. I now know why. Food took over 30 minutes, for 2 appetizers, TV's were playing the local news with no sound or CC (might as well had muted C-SPAN on), and all anyone working there wanted to do was closing clean up, even though they had 2 1/2 more hours to go till closing. Food was ok, service was sub-par. Needless to say we will not be going there again, unless there are no other options. Still would probably just go home hungry.We had a GC that was expiring that night so we ran in for a quick dinner. Both had beers, the beers were great , the moldy oranges on the rim were not. Megan was our waitress and she was great and even joked around a little with us and that was nice. I think we ordered way wrong on the food as the reviews on here are raving about the burgers, had the chicken Parmesan and wow what a hot mess that was, straight tomato paste out of the can over linguine noodles and some chicken tenders cut up and mixed throughout.  This dish should be taken off the menu or worked out. Had a dinner salad as well, nothing special here but the ranch was good. Dont think we would go back.I'm spoiled by the old location we had here in Surprise where the staff was fun, friendly, and on point. This location, the staff is indifferent, in a rush, and don't even make eye contact with you when you order. I really hate that. 

The menu is the same and the food is good. But the staff is what really makes this location a 2 star joint. They really need to get a personality!I went to Hooters in FLA when they first opened and thought they had the best chicken wings ever. Unfortunately, ever since they became really popular, I haven't been able to repeat that experience in the ensuing 15 years and 30+ states. I have to preface this review by stating that I'm wicked fussy about my chicken. 
The wings aren't awful, but they are not the best either. They were moist, but the coating was somewhat hard in places and there were rubbery tendons inside (like a rubber band between your teeth). I have NEVER had wings that still had the "tips" attached and these did along with a few quills broken off inside them. The service was OK and the food came quickly. Chik-A-Fil, Popeyes or good ol' KFC is a bit better though.Ive only been to this Ulta once and the girl that helped me ( a red head) was very rude to me. I walked out. ther's now way in heck I'm supporting a business that is rude. Its a poor man's Sephora but I was willing to give it a try just b/c its closer to my house than a Sephora is. 
Its sad when one person can ruin it for everybody else. I mentioned that I previously purchased an item in the past and was looking for another one. Without going into details that make this story long she used this story as an opportunity to insult Sephora and all the products they carry. 
Really?
EVERYTHING you sell in the store that isnt carried by walmart or Ulta brand is ALSO carried in Sephora. Their inventory puts yours to shame. If your angle to improve your business is to insult the competition, I'd rethink your strategy. Most importantly: start with not insulting me and the products that I was going to purchase in your store
I wont go back here unless its an ultimate emergency...and seeing as how there are 4 Sephoras in town I'll drive across town to go there b4 I go here again. and if i did return I'd be sure to say no thanks when asked if I need help.Food good but service slow and when I went to the bathroom the bus girl took my shopping bags away! I was solo and left my bags while running to pee and they were taken! She apologized and said "thought you left" but it freaked me out! I was gone less than 3 mins! Wow. Burger yummy and made quickly! Low review due to scare as it killed my experience. Watch bags when visiting!I feel a little bit weird about giving a sub-par rating.  I'm not much of a seafood fan, so my opinions might not be too strongly formed.  Though, it seems plenty of other folks have given this place less than stellar reviews.

I ordered a "New Orleans Pot" or something like that.  The menu described it as shrimp and sausage with some spicy cajun seasoning.  Turns out it had crawfish too, but maybe I just didn't notice.  The sausage was just one link and a bit bland.  In fact, the shrimp was bland too.  The waitress "warned me" it would be spicy, but after removing the shrimp shell the shrimp tasted like regular ordinary shrimp.  The shrimp was a bit mushy too, is it supposed to be like that (like I said, I'm not a seafood expert)?

The pot meal came with corn on the cob.  I asked the waitress to substitute with a side of steamed broccoli.  She said that wouldn't be a problem.  I suppose she forgot (it happens, not *that* big of a deal).  Problem is, she seemed to have quite a few memory problems as she also forgot to bring out my friend's side salad.

Also, the food was really slow to come out.  The restaurant was practically empty.  It felt like it took forever.Visiting from LA. Went to this pace based on the Yelp positive feedback. 
Hard to believe the ratings. Early Friday dinner, not crowded yet took nearly 45 minutes for an order of ravioli and a small pizza.
The there was the bland taste. Ever so slightly better than big box chain Whitewash Italian. Pizza crust tuff, as if old or overworked. No sauce to speak of and overly cheesy. Ravioli on the hard side of al dente, nearly tasteless meat filling. 

On the positive side, the staff were very friendly and apologetic on the long wait. Perhaps locals prioritize service over food. Otherwise visitors should go elsewhere.Sorry, but I HATE the service. When I go out to eat I lvoe help, but please do not stand in the back of me. It is annoying and intimidating. It does suck that you only have one hour and you have to finish your plate. Its forcced more than enjoyed. The sushi is ok and the yum yum sauce is good. I won't be returning though.I totally dug the enterior but that is where it stopped. The rolls all pretty much were the same rolls on the menu,but named different things,looked the same when they came out and were WAY over priced. I live downtown Vegas and drove here because I was on a date, I think I would be much better off at an all you can eat sushi joint on Flamingo,rather than drive to Timbucktoo and pay out the butt for mediocre sushi. The sushi chefs however were very entertaining while chugging booze with the people at the sushi bar and making everyones sushi. That was a plus with the entertainment there.First off you need to take a cab from the strip to a strip mall some distance away, then you will need to wait in line for 30mts outside in the heat. When we walked they told us the AC was broke and they had some smalls fans set up on the floor. We ordered the Pho, they only have one size ... extra large bowl. The soup was kinda watered down and the meat was a little chewy and a ton of noodles. We went here only because someone from California recommended this place to us...Have been here a couple times when I'm in Vegas. 
Sure, Pho is the best hangover food you can get, but personally think they're a bit on the pricey side, and their broth isn't that special. They do offer a lot more different kinds of food other than Vietnamese food though.

However, their service is HORRIBLE. People always say, oh yeah you shouldn't expect good services from Asian restaurants , or oh yeah the worse the service is, the better the food is! No, just no. We had to ask them so many times for them to bring up waters, they came to us with the wrong food, server was very impatient when we ordered, and when the food came, they just quickly put the food down anywhere on our table, we had to move the food ourselves. 

Meh. Also there's always a long line. Unless I really want Pho and I can't wait till I get back to LA, I probably won't come here again.If you're in the vicinity and you're itching for a plate lunch, this place will scratch the itch a bit.  IMHO, there are way better Island-kine food establishments in Vegas.  I stop in here because it's close to work, centrally located, and like I said, Aloha Kitchen helps scratch at that craving.  Last visit, I tried the beef curry stew, which I think was a special ... it was like a huge chunk of potato, couple pieces of carrot, and some stringy beef, with the requisite large scoops of rice and mac salad.  Not impressed.  Should have stuck with the tried-n-true adobo fried rice omelette.  Service is usually friendly and the wait is not too long.  A big plus is that the interior decor has been spiffed up considerably, the colors are inviting, and it seems much fresher inside.SLOWEST SUSHI PLACE I'VE EVER BEEN TO. Seriously. 

Granted, I came here with a fairly large group (10+ ppl), but the restaurant only had 2 other tables, and most of us ordered the chicken teriyaki lunch combo.  It took us so long to get drinks, order, and pay, I considered leaving multiple times during my meal. To top it off, the one person who ordered the sashimi salad got her food last! Like, that is the ONE DISH that did not require any cooking!!! And it came out like 10 mins after all the bento boxes (and each bento box came out as if the cook in the back was preparing each one at a time...)

Food was mediocre at best, and not great for the price.  The only reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1 star is because it's walking distance from UMC and because the food was clean and I did not get sick...Food is ok. Large portion. Service is below average. Comparing with another Sam Woo, this one is expensive one.
Why I stay on a long line for this ok but pricy food?I went here a few times with a friend of mine. He immediately became a big fan... for me... my grandma did much better sandwiches... nothing special about the place. The place looks worn... the food is below avg (IMHO).. I mean.. the bread is bad! but if you've heard of it, you should give it a try. Good luck!Never been a fan at buffet Asia. The food is ok. The iced tea is what I call tea not so much ice and it is always hot in there (The one on Flamingo is even worse in my opinion). The few bright spots are that the drinks are included and the service is above average.I actually had a good time here and overall the place was okay.  

The place has a nascar country hillbilly theme...It is called Saddles and Spurs.  It is plenty spacious in there for a maybe a big group.  Kinda run down but not too dirty or anything.

Went for Karaoke.  It was pretty slow.  It is good if you are someone who just wants to sing a bunch of songs.  Or if you bring a big group of friends and bring your own atmosphere.

I typically love a place like this just because this is what bars look like back home!  But I almost gave it one star for one reason.

They do not accept credit cards.  NOTE TO OWNER; it is 2011 time to get a credit card machine.  I handed the bartender my card and asked to run a tab- he looked at me like i was crazy and chuckled .. "cash only."  The ATM machine there is out of order!  

ATTENTION OWNER OF THIS PLACE:  please provide a basic convenience for your customers.  Get a credit card machine.I usually like La Quinta but this one was not a great choice.  I don't think there are many people here.  There are only about 5 cars in the parking lot.  But the room is ok.  Not lovely like other La Quintas. I think La Quinta should reconsider this hotel.  It doesn't represent their brand At All.
In specific, the TV isn't good.  A light bulb was burn't out.  The Coffee at breakfast was about 1/2 strength (that's just weird). and the closet hasn't been vacuumed in a long time.
SIGH.

So much for making reservations on line.Too busy to place a take out order is what i was told by an employee. Update your website and indicate that take out orders are not available. Im glad Ihop was available to take my orderIf you are looking for real Mexican food don't waste your money here . Roberto's has more authentic and tastier food. Burritos are 75% beans 25%  meat and bland. Spend your money at Casa Don Juan in the downtown area instead. That's probably the best Mexican food that this SoCali girl has found in LV... Cabo at Red Rock is better too...overall Super Mex was Super Disappointing


PS - be prepared to have them take your smartphone to the bar cashier to redeem your groupon... Super Disturbing to have someone take my open phone out of my sight :-/First impression of the place: walking into a doctors office with horrific overhead lights. No one at the reception desk to greet you, no where to really sit. Once inside, the massage areas were dark, cool and clean which was a relief and the massage I received was good but its still an odd place. I added a body scrub to my massage service and strangely enough, there was no shower to rinse off afterwards. Body scrubs should be done in a wet room, not a dry massage room. So I left feeling little bits of scrub on me and sticky for the rest of the day.The one and only reason why we stayed here.....25 dollars a night for a room? Yeah....I'm a Hooters Girl somewhere else and we get a fat discount.
Never again I'm going on vacation to a place where your room looks like your work....aahhH!!!! I came back more stressed out than I left!
Nightmare.
The only good thing, it's next to the strip so that's a plus...and the company I brought with me was the best.
And to whoever said the "self-respect" thing....we actually wear more clothes than a lot of restaurants! If you are from LA....go to Saddle Ranch, you'll see what I mean!
And how could I forget! The girls....OH   MY   GOD. Horrid....Hideous? Whichever you prefer! They looked like 35 year old single moms....ex coke heads... seriously.....no thanksOn my way to Vegas there where bulletin boards advertising free hot wings and $100 free slot play with membership of their club. So I was like why not. I haven't been and I heard it was a nice casino and hotel. The casino was nice with hardwood floors like their restaurants and a nice change from the usual tacky carpet print. But the casino is small. And the hot wings are not free. It's only free after 12am-6am. Talk about false advertisement. I played for free and left because if I was gonna eat hot wings from hooters and pay for them I might as well eat them at home.Where do I start, I have heard so many good things about restaurant, especially this location.  I had told myself, before I bring my mom here, she considers herself Chinese Food Buffet Connoisseur so I had to scope it out. hmm...EPIC FAIL, not impressed, actually disappointed.

I hate wasting money, and to me this was a waste of money.  Saturday, dinner time, it was packed in there, there was a 15min wait to be seated. It was just me and my 3yr old nephew, yet they called out and seated numbers that were after us. (They lose an entire STAR for that tacky sh!t right, a potential 4STAR rating is still achievable right? NO, HELLS NAH)

We were finally seated, I promise it looked like a feeding frenzy in there.  I'm a sushi fan, it just looked very contaminated, people breathing over it, no please make my Sushi in front of me Thank You much.  This buffet over somewhat of a variety of dishes, but standard Chinese buffet fare.  You know the staples: orange chicken, beef broccoli, chow mien, egg drop soup, pizza, etc, etc.

Empty tins w/ no food, granted it was busy in there and maybe they could not keep up with the demand but when they did food did come out it was enough for like 5 people.  Some dished were piping hot and others were luke warm.  I'll just comment on the items I DID eat:

Orange Chicken: ok, I didn't eat this but I had to comment on this, Orange Chicken is my go to  item when I go to these type of buffet. Um, Orange Chicken is not suppose to be SOUPY.  I cannot make this up, it looked like orange chicken soup, NO BUENO.

Chow Mien: hmm, greasy, no crunch to the veggies

Baked Mussel: it was ok, mussels were minced with some kind of cream cheese and melted cheddar cheese on top

Fried Butterfly Shrimp: can't go wrong with this, its boxed shrimp, yum yum good :-)

Green Beans: greens beans are my fav, um yea they were greasy too and limp, no snap

Peppered Chicken: that was decent, but the jalapenos took over my pallet so I had to pick around it

Crab Ragoons and Egg Rolls: once again you cannot go wrong w/ fried foods

Pot Stickers: dough was gummy, at the edges it was hard as if they had been sitting out for a long time

Pizza: this is my little dudes favorite, he can eat 3 regular slices...he ate 1 slice and picked at the other slice

Sweet and Sour Chicken: no need for the sauce because the chicken was hard as HELL, another item  that had been sitting out way too long.  needles to say that was not consumed

Friend Chicken Wings: I didn't eat them, but my kid enjoyed them.  I'll say it again,  you cannot go wrong w/ fried foods

the SERVICE: BAD enough said (-2STARS for bad service)

Overall, food was not even So-So, I've had better, HELL - we've ALL had better. $25.97 for $5.00 buffet food.  I'm so done

So, we will not be back to this establishment, and I will take my mom "The Chinese Food Buffer Connoisseur" somewhere else.  I've had better, there IS better in the valley, but this is only my opinion, try it out for yourself and see how you like it.Its alright, but maybe I have been spoiled by the west coast. :D Food was decent and the server was friendly and a hard worker. Only downside is the person running the place? The entire time there, he was running around yelling at everyone, especially the server. I won't be surprised if she quits soon. The owner seems like a total dick. Will not be eating here again.Food is average. The Nile and Middle Eastern Cafe are much better.Portion is huge,quite pricey.  This place is just okay for me,would not go back.Kind of like a deli, but it's not super cheap.  Good if you're a on the square and in a hurry I suppose. For a leisurely breakfast, I'd suggest you look elsewhere. 

The business model is that of a diner, minus the service and normal amount of space  (sounds like a winner, huh?). You come in, grab a piece of heavyweight, printed paper that claims to be a menu, and then you order. (Don't blink, the line moves fast.) Unlike a diner, the Marigold Kitchen isn't content to serve you french toast. No, they have to add nuts, 3 types of berries, some organic cheese and whatever. All the food  is like this. You may not get any service, but your plate looks good before you eat it. Food snob?--you'll love this.

Ambiance:  well it has the typical too trendy look to it. Every wall is painted some color that clashes with another. The seats and stools are uncomfortable, but look nice. And oh, don't miss the men's bathroom, it's the girliest thing I've ever seen.  ...Well, except for the double caged light fixture that looks like it belongs on a ship. 

The staff:  clearly a look to them.  Seems like stereotypical co-op college lesbians.  Short hair, attitude, matching t-shirts, probably pit hair. If you have a problem with sexuality, that's your issue, not mine. I make note of it  because I don't care for stores where everyone looks the same. Y'know like TGIF's with its flair buttons? Hate that. Well, this is the same deal, but just another costume

Will you like the food?  Let's get serious. You don't go to this place for the food. Nonetheless, it gets a passing grade. I didn't throw up or anything.I had bought my husband a "Kenneth Cole" wristwatch from Macy's as a present and when he needed a new battery for it, we took it to Dykamn's where we got lectured for not buying a watch from a company that specifically makes timepieces. Um, I didn't appreciate getting that lecture. I went to Macy's looking to buy a nice present for my husband - and I thought a watch would be perfect, and it looked stylish, too. So sue me! The watch works fine, and still works and even better than other watches we have here at home that are made by "watch making" companies.

And speaking of fine "watch making" companies, I needed a new wristband for my Skagen watch. The watch was designed in a way to look stylish, but it actually was a design flaw that made a weak point for the writstband, which had worn through. I took it in to Dykman's to get a new writstband, and OK - I happen to love colors and because I love colors other than boring black or brown, I wanted a red wristband. Apparently, that was asking for too much and apparently to Dykman's, grownups don't wear colorful wristbands. My only choice was a black wristband - so a black wristband I got. I was told that was all Skagen had to offer as it had to be ordered from Skagen (that's how special the watch was), but I'm suspicious about that.

Then, during the former occasion, I took in my "Nine West" watch - the scandal of it all! This time, it wasn't a Skagen - so I knew I could safely ask for a red wristband. I did get a red wristband - but later, when I got some time to think about it and examine it more, I think I got a child's wristband. I mean really! Is it so hard to have a variety of adult wristbands to choose from? Is it too much to ask for something other than black, or brown?

The last straw was when I got a battery put in the Nine West watch after the above lecture on the inferior quality of timepieces made by companies that don't specialize in making watches and clocks - and suddenly, the battery didn't last very long at all. At first, I thought - darn fashion company for making an inferior watch - but then I went to get a new battery put in just to see and funny thing, it kept on ticking and still works to this day (although maybe there was a slight point in the lecture, as the hands are a little bit off, but it still works. I cannot even tell you where my Skagen watch is, as the stupid design flaw has rendered that watch unwearable and missing in action to this day.)I was disappointed in my food tonight. The Tom Ka soup was sour with no spicy kick and the noodle dish was very bland.Come here with the expectation of loosening your pants by the end.
And eat the french toast.

there is some serious and unabashed EGG-CHEESE-PORK love here, so sidle up and get some.

Personally, it's not for me. It feels a lot like a 90s business-lunch place. Think Ferris Bueller's Dad/cob salad with lots of cheese/meat and potatoes. The "creative" twist every one is talking about is a 90s plating device, more about presentation that new and distinct tastes. But if the in-laws are in town from Minneapolis...well, this is the place.Alright so I've only ever been here when I've been hungover. But let me tell you, the shitty $1.99 bottomless coffee, hash browns, and omelet stuffed with all sorts of processed cheese and meat...IS THE BEST HANGOVER CURE EVER.  

The place is like Denny's.  Big whoop.  Everyone there seems a little depressed....customers, staff, everyone.  But hey, with that type of environment going in your sweatpants and with a hangover...you fit right in.The place seem to ONLY serve as a quick stop for people attending a downtown event to get a drink or two prior to the event (The Dodge Theater, Suns or Diamondbacks).  Crowds come early and leave soon there after ... some may return after the event but I wouldn't count on it.  The peeps are either sports fans and/or music fans that enjoy seeing a show sitting down in a cushy seat (i.e. The Dodge Theater).  The fish dinner is good and Brittany the waitress even better (I'm a "big fan") ... but all-in-all ... not my cup of tea.The food was good ...the price is okay to me because back i would have got this for a lot less but for where am at it's good and much better than the state fair food.....and there open late that's a super plus ...just think there a bit rude that's allI had a waffle cone with a scoop of peanut butter cup and a scoop of rocky road. The ice cream wasn't great; the flavors seemed off, and the texture was grainy. The cone was flavorless and fell apart before I finished the first scoop. For the price, it didn't really seem worth it.Disappointing....we brought our kids in with another family on a Tuesday night.  We sat outside and the weather was nice.  It wasn't very busy, but for some reason our food took almost an hour I come and when it did, it was good but that might also be because I was starving.  I frankly expected more at least in service, the waitress was nice but we had to ask for more water, and just felt like we go forgotten.  Not sure if I will be in a hurry to come back...First, we've been going to Wineburger's for a while now...great laidback place to have a burger...in a bar but it doesn't feel like bar.  Anyway, something changed about 6 months or a year ago, and we really haven't been back.  The burgers are still good, but...where'd the beer-battered fries go???  I hate those frozen steak fries!  Bring back the beer-battered fries, or at least hand-cut the fries from potatoes.  It's probably a lot cheaper (and better!) anyway.  And the pickles...ugh!  A sweet pickle spear???  Who eats that?  I asked for a dill spear, and was told it was $1.50...seriously???  So we haven't been been back for awhile.  If the reviews start trending up again, we'll give it a another go.Quick service. Everything else is very poor. Customer service poor. Adding on unnecessary charges not approved by me. Explanation of what I actual need and what they say I should get was fuzzy and couldn't get a straight answer really. No... I'll try and find another place I won't feel taken advantage ofI'm not to sure what the big deal is about this place.  I was staying at the HGI up the street and so I moseyed into this place for some barbecue.  I decided to have some ribs and beer so I rolled up my sleeves and got to work.  Unfortunately, that's what the ribs were... work.  They ribs were no where near fall-off-the-bone.  The beer was perfectly cold but the ribs were forgettable.  I knew I should have ordered the chicken fried chicken.  Ah, well.  Next time.food was good our service was notNow Lennys is by no means completely bad but compared to what it used to be i am so disappointed and sad. I've been coming here for 6 years and was always satisfied until the prep for the new building. 

It obviously wasnt cheap to build a new place and i can tell they took it out on their loyal customers. I used to be able to come here on my lunch break with a five dollar bill in hand and get a no 1 combo with a BIG soft drink. First the price went up about a buck, thats fine its not gonna cost the same forever. But then as they were planning the new build there went the big drink in exchange for a small drink not half the size it used to be.

Now with the new building open prices are even higher, food is nothing like it used to be (half assed), food takes ten times longer to come out, and none of the old friendly staff is there, just pimply teen agers that don't give a shit and are rood as hell. Plus they now wrap their food in this tin foil shit that makes my food even worse bc now its soggy AND half assed- I'm assuming the new wrap is cheaper.

The whole place has become a production. Lenny you may have had the best burger in town at one point and i may have agreed but not anymore, not even close.

I paid 9.48 for a no 1 combo with a beyond SMALL shake. Long cry from its roots. Just another burger king or mcdonalds now...I ate the "Value Gyros Meal" which consisted of a Gyros, fries and a fountain drink.. The fries were fresh and well done with no greasy taste.. the fountain drink was fine... but I came for the Gyros and what can I say.. the portion was ample but the meat was lacking in taste and a good gyro's got taste.. and as they say.."the Chef is in the sauce" and honestly the yogurt and cucumbers were barely discernible on the gyro.. Having lived in the area of Tarpon Springs, Florida for 25 years I ate a lot of good gyros and this was not one.. There are better ones in the Valley..Pluses... Location, friendly staff that's about it.  Stayed at this hotel because we were attending a swim meet across the street.  Our room was fair at best.  Everything was old. The bed was so hard and lumpy, I had a sore shoulder for 3 days.  Toilet was constantly running and the AC unit sounded like it was 30 years old.  We paid a discounted rate of $139/night...it was worth around $60.Orange Table? I almost gave you three stars because of that superb BLT, but I can't say honestly that everything was A-okay. My kids loved their grilled cheese - it looked a little intimidating what with that thick and oh-so nicely toasted bread, but really - the kiddies devoured them and felt satisfied.

The service, however, is not so great. Yeah. We waited a long time for you guys to get your act together and think about how to put the tables together for us. And it was crowded - so for awhile I gave you a break on that. But then it wasn't crowded and the tables didn't get moved and we didn't get seated and you all were standing around the counter pretty much not doing anything - not even slinging any attitude. This kind of service seems consistent with the other reviews I've read, so I gather maybe you're holding yourself to a different standard and that's fine. But to be honest now - I've experienced hipper and ruder waitstaff and you'll just have to dig a little deeper if that's the niche you're going for, 'k?The problem with Nordstroms is you spend $$ for a nice shirt/pant/jeans and see 18 other people wearing the exact same thing in a span over the next 14 days. I prefer spending my money at places where things aren't mass "over"produced and expensive. For quality of the product to price, I would say Nordstroms is extremely poor.

If you think Nordstroms men's or woman's shoe selection is the largest ever...than you surely haven't been to LA, San Francisco, Miami, NYC or Chicago. 

By the way, why are 1/2 the women shoes made of patent leather? I guess if you're a stripper, it's right up your alley.The staff here is pretty unwelcoming.  Apparently you'll only be acknowledged if you look older than 40.  I was browsing the engagement rings and one of the ladies behind the counter seemed busy writing something so I didn't want to disturb her and ask a question immediately.  I just thought she'd finish her task and I could stick around long enough for her to approach me.  I was standing in front of her for at least 5 minutes looking at some rings but she never once said anything to me.  Instead she moved down to greet another person I know came after me.

The store itself is pretty dated and could use some revamping.  I thought it was pretty tacky that they had some old metal easel stand in the middle of the store near the men's watches with a banged up white foam poster board perched upon it.  There wasn't actually anything on the sign either.  It's little details like that which you would think a company like Tiffany & Co. would carefully watch.  I've been to Tiffany stores in San Diego and Guam and those stores are extremely concerned with presentation and details like fresh flower arrangements and updated cases.5 visits to Don & Charlie's and I can form an opinion finally. Well, thats not all true, I had a good opinion formed after the first visit but kept coming back because everyone sang such high praises. In all honesty, I have to wonder about the people singing praises of this place. Are they the same people that think TGI Friday's is a nice night out? Red Lobster is good seafood? A phenomenal upscale night out is Cheesecake Factory? They must be.... MUST BE.

Now before you all go screaming how you are insulted because you like Don & Charlie's, hear me out. They are part of a chain of 35 restaurants called Lettuce Entertain You, cute. The other Phoenix location they own is Maggiano's Little Italy, which is always forgetful. From the moment you walk in and are coldly greeted by a teenage girl, who is only there because daddy wants her to have a job to prove she is mature enough to drive the BMW he just bought her for sweet 16, one has to wonder what they are in for. Is this going to be a fun-filled evening with wacky sports memorabilia all over the walls and fun servers? Are you going to be taken into the wacky world of Chicago/Phoenix sports history? Are you in for the best BBQ you've ever had? Hardly.

Despite warnings from a co-worker whom had been prior to my visit that said the tough and dry ribs won't come off the bone despite any efforts you make, I ordered them. He was right. With me done trying to separate the meat from the bone, and giving up, I put the bone down, still covered in meat. The ribs came with a chicken schnitzel that had pretty much zero flavor, at all. Next visit dad and I both ordered Prime Rib, ate about 2/3 of it and both agreed that eating the rest just wouldn't be worth it. Another visit we ordered a shrimp cocktail, a couple of steaks, wedge salads, calamari, and a few other odds and ends. The 4 of us that night spent quite some time in the bathroom at our respective homes. 

The service has never been really friendly, to say the least, but usually spot on helpful. On my 5 visits, I've had 3 different servers. One, a large middle aged gentleman, is the most matter of fact guy I've probably ever encountered. Just not the personality for a server and while I understand where he is coming from, my guests thought he was downright rude. Another, an older woman, likes to slam stuff onto your table, without saying a word. I'm sorry, I expect you to be nice to me. Maybe you could be more like the *runners* at Applebee's and tell me what you are putting in front of me and ask me if I want anything else. Sad that you don't even stack up to a food runner at Applebee's, a place that I'll never give an endorsement to. Stop giving me the cold shoulder. I'm not your enemy, in fact we have never met.

I understand Don & Charlie's for what it is. It is a restaurant that appeals to two crowds. One crowd is the elderly who want blander foods because they don't like the spices. I can understand that, and it's only fair they have a place to go. They go here because they know what they are going to get, have a great choice of early-bird specials, and will never get indigestion from spices. Old people tend to be incontinent anyhow, so they are likely to not notice the diarrhea they get afterward. The second group is tourists/people hosting tourists who go for the kitschy sports atmosphere, and accept that the food is less than average and or don't really care. Maybe some of these people aren't interested in quality and just think food is food. I have a buddy who swears it is the best steakhouse in town. He is also the same guy who eats Taco Bell, Applebee's, Outback, Etc. on a regular basis because they are the best places in town. There is something to be said for people with no taste buds, they are way easy to please!My family and I moved to Scottsdale over 20 years ago and I have always had a place in my heart for Don & Charlie's.  We used to go there often for birthdays/anniversaries/graduations, etc.  It was my birthday this week and my parents wanted to take me out so I said "Let's go to Don & Charlie's, I haven't been there in I don't know how long".  Sadly, after having eaten there I believe that I made a mistake with this suggestion.  The restaurant itself hasn't changed since the last time I was there - it's still got wall-to-wall memorabilia, it still has the same old-school steak house ambiance, but the feeling that I got during and after the meal was really one of a restaurant that is resting upon its laurels and not doing much to deliver a quality product.  My Caesar salad was made with lettuce that was obviously old - it was not wilted, but it was very soft and floppy with no crunch to it whatsoever.  My father ordered the creamy coleslaw which bore a great resemblance to cabbage soup so high was the dressing to cabbage ratio.  My mother greatly enjoyed her house salad with a balsamic dressing but this was mostly because she thought the balsamic was the best that she had had in a long while.  All three of us ordered baby back ribs for dinner - my parents just had the ribs, I had a combo with the ribs and a filet.  All three of us remarked that the ribs were "passable",  the meat was tough and fatty - not at all what I remember in terms of quality from when I used to eat there.  I have honestly had ribs that I found more enjoyable at casual restaurants like TGI Friday's or Ruby Tuesday's.  When you are charging $30 for a rack of ribs, they REALLY need to be better than "acceptable" which was the highest grade I could offer on these.  While ordering our entrees, my mother asked which ribs were more tender and our server informed us that the beef ribs were the most tender, but they had sold out of their entire stock of beef ribs already.  Our reservation was at 6:30 - fairly early in the evening, so my mother's reaction was "Really?"  His response - "Oh yes, they were actually sold out at 5:00 PM."  This speaks to a lack of organization and knowledge on the part of management - if you are running out of a popular item by 5 PM on a weekend before proper dinner service even begins then that indicates a serious problem.  My Filet was better than acceptable - it was not as good as I remember, but still very good.  Unfortunately my disappointment in the ribs was such that it overshadowed any feelings I may have had about the steak.  Our server was professional and courteous and I did not notice any of the issues with the hostesses that some others have reported, but I really have to say that I am disappointed in Don & Charlie's.  It's one thing to go back to a place you have a fondness for and find the experience lacking in relation what you remember - we all have a tendency to look at the past with rose-colored glasses I think.  This was a case of going to a place that I have a genuine fondness for and find the experience lacking in relation to what I consider acceptable for any high end restaurant.  I believe my grade of "Meh. I've experienced better." is completely accurate - I have experienced better at other steak houses, at other casual dining restaurants, even hole-in-the wall eateries where I used plastic utensils to eat my meal.  I say this as someone who has nothing but fond feelings for D&C's - you guys need to improve, because a wall full of signed baseballs and dim lighting will only take you so far.ONE STAR DINNER - I wish I could give this a higher rating. The 2nd star is ONLY for the flamenco show, which was fun, and a little 3-yr-old flamenco dancer stole the show.

We used the Entertainment coupon, 2-for-1 dinner up to $20. "Greeted" at door by a sour-faced older white guy who made it VERY clear we were late for our reservation & he didn't approve. We noticed, however, that the seating was very empty, and even at the end of dinner, there was no one waiting for tables.

Friendly waiter, but got busy and never asked if we wanted another round of drinks even though my glass sat empty perched at the edge of the table. 

The sangria... Meh. I ordered it here about 5 years ago, it was better that night. Tonight it tasted like red wine, a little fruit juice, and water, as if it used to be iced down, but it melted. My husband agreed. I was going to order a different drink, but the waiter never asked. 

The meal - we didn't want paella, which is supposedly something they make decently. We got a steak and a chicken breast dish. The steak was "fine,' not good flavor but edible. My 2 boneless chicken breasts were perfectly uniform under a mushroom sauce. The mushrooms were sadly just canned, button mushrooms - I expected savory sauteed mushrooms, I got a weird pickled twang. The chicken was WEIRD. Reminded me of institutional cafeteria food, couldn't place it. After two bites, I quit. My husband tried it - they were so "uniform" because they were like large un-breaded McNuggets - like pressed chicken, we think. GROSS.  The cookedveggies were actually fresh, but sadly doused in so much garlic powder I couldn't do more than a few bites. 

Even though I didn't eat the chicken dinner, no point in asking for a refund, since it was the $20 of the 2-for-1 (although the coupon does charge 18% gratuity on full price before discount, so the waiter got a couple of extra pity bucks. it's gotta suck to serve such bad food). 

SUMMARY: I cringe to say this, but that was the worst dinner I've had in a LONG time. ONLY GO FOR THE SHOW!I've been going to Kyoto for nearly 10 years now, by far has always been my favorite Scottsdale sushi place. The bento box lunch specials are incredible. Regretably, I have to change my opinion. 

The service has gone downhill drastically. My BF and I loved to go for the #8 sashimi box, I don't like salmon so I always sub more tuna. 9x out of 10, order comes out wrong. Haven't been there 1 time when we didn't have to sit with empty water glasses for 15 min. So we stopped going for a while. 

Yesterday, we decided to give Kyoto a 2nd chance. Service was perfectly fine this time (noticed a few new faces) but to my lament... Our sashimi was warm and mushy. NOT what you want to see! I couldn't even eat it, so gave to my BF. Well, guess who spent the next 24 hrs sitting on the porcelain throne. 

Yes, it's AZ and it's hot. But if it's not fit to eat... DON'T SERVE IT! 

I'm truly sad, but I don't think I'll be going back unless I'm in the mood for something cooked.The food was fine but the waitress had too many tables and and the sandwich came long after our drinks were gone 20-30 min. we won't go back!Very beige.

I didn't expect much due to the previous reviews.  Check-in was a tad cold, not very welcoming.  Front desk clerk pointed me toward the bellman to direct me to my room, which was at the back of the property no where near the lobby...she could have at least circled it on the paper map.  

Room- beige, and definitely could use a renovation b/c it's quite dated and tired.  One wall was mirrored, bathroom fixtures were gold.  Air conditioner and the bathroom vent were so loud, they sounded like an airplane was flying through the room when on.  Parking is limited...there are large storage containers blocking lots of spaces.  Thinly insulated...I could hear people walking by and talking and doors slamming.  Location is pretty good, right on Scottsdale Rd, about 10-15 minutes from Old Town Scottsdale.  I would say this is a 2-3 star place, and not any more.  

Biggest gripe- it's the 21st century...Offer free wi-fi, (at least in the common areas).Well...ya...the staff was great!  Very nice and helpful people.  However, this small place crowded store left me wanting more...more space.  Haha. 

They do have some great choices available that are exclusively Trader Joe's, but I still prefer sprouts for my veggie and fruit shopping.Using a Groupon, we first sat in the bar where older set, over 65, listened to live piano.  Ordered a mediocre Caesar Salad and a nice Escargot that required a little extra salt but had plenty of nice garlic butter to dip the accompanying french bread. 
On a Thursday night, the dining room felt very empty, only a handful of people, all older.  Enjoyed the delicious Tournedos Oscar.  My husband had a Wilted Spinach Salad, Crab Cocktail, and a noteworthy French Onion Soup.  Crab tasted old and salad was just so-so.  For an upscale pricey restaurant, the servers were immature and uninformed, lacking the skills to deliver properly.  Most always generous with our tipping, 20% or more, we could not justify more than 15% in both the bar and restaurant.  Would have been very disappointed if we paid full price this dining experience.A rare yelp disappointment!  Just a touch about Filiberto's and that's a very generous compliment.  

I ordered the two carne asada burrito combo with rice and beans.  The rice was bland and room temperature as was the beans.  My wife chewed on something that definitely wasn't carne asada and had to spit it out.  My carne asada was rubbery and just average at best. Everything about this place was a disappointment, even the prices which I thought were actually high for a hole-in-the-wall that you have to look hard to find.  

Do yourself a favor and get a carne asada somewhere else.The food I was served was nasty.  I will not go back there.Went into RA to grab a drink with a few friends. It took the bartender 15 minutes to determine if my ID was real, along with my friends ID. I understand that the laws are very strict here and I appreciate the bartender being careful but 15+ minutes to get my drink and NO apology from anyone!!! WHAT THE...probably won't be back.went here with a group from work and it was okay. the kobe sliders could have been better. i also had the crab stuffed shrimp and it was too salty.

one really bad thing was the beer...the house beer i wanted was not available for what it felt like 30 mins as they were changing the tap. that was silly...i had to settle for another beer.I recently ate here with my old boss from many years ago.  Food was ok and margaritas were "different" as expressed by my former boss from Austin, TX.  My margaritas (and I had several different types) definitely tasted different than any of the many margaritas I've had all over the place (not bad but maybe just weak and lacking tequila with certainly a "different" kind of flavor than I've ever had before).  

The food portion size was very large but the wait staff got a bit irritating with constant upselling (we had a new wait staff being trained by a manager and the manager was over the top exaggerating the upsale).  We had ordered queso but thankfully with all the focus on training the upsale they forgot about it and my old boss and I were full to bursting.  The menu descriptions also seemed to be a bit different than what we received but we just drank more and let it slide.My girlfriend was in from out of town and we wanted a good, romantic dinner.  I just moved to Scottsdale for business and being from Chicago, I wanted a good spot.  House of Tricks was marginal at best.  First of all, everyone claims good ambiance.  Not what its hyped up to be.  We were sat in this very small dining room immediatly when you walk in.  The worst part was that there was no music or background noise at all.  We felt like we were in a library.  With only 2 other tables, it was very awkward all night.  I'm not saying we were looking for some chic modern place, but no noise, literally, was very weird.  We were turned off from the get go, but stuck it out.  The food was pretty good (scallop app was delicious), but the overall atmosphere ruined the meal.  The service, again was just ok.  Our waiter was a bit too attentive. Overall, I'd look elsewhere before going.  Not at all what it is hyped up to be, especially for a $200 meal.OK, I have only been here one time.  And that was the last time.  Sat down and looked at the menu.  I saw the mixed seafood plate which comes with shrimp, scallops, fish fillet and squid.  

I asked my waiter how it was prepared.  
       He answered, "in a sweet and sour sauce."  
Me: "sweet and sour sauce?" (incredulously)  
       Waiter: "Well, mostly sour sauce." 
"Are you sure?" 
       "No, not really."  
"Can you please go ask?"

I ended up ordering it as it usually is prepared in some fantastic basil/thai chili paste sauce that I love.  It arrived, just as advertised, in a lemon, fish sauce, chili-flakes concoction.  The scallops pieces were microscopic, the few squid rings were rubbery, and the fish fillet was gross--all on a bed of lettuce to distract you from the real size of your $13 or$14 entree.  The sauce was as simple, and uninspired, as explained to me by the newly-informed waiter.  The amount of fish was disappointing.  The sauce was below average.  

I am only giving this place 2 stars, instead of one, because if I lived here, I might be forced to return.  There don't seem to be many Thai restaurants in the area.Well, considering the fact that the busser picked up a napkin from the floor and put it back on my table, I'm a little concerned about their adherence to health codes....thanks for the good gin and tonic and service (from the server) but no thanks ... no matter how close to work this place is I'm not coming backSo i decided to try the mexican place across the street from me thinking it might be tasty... unfortunately my phone call started with a elderly woman who did not know what was on the menu and she almost caused me to cuss at her and hang up... I finally get my order through and i go to pick up my food.  It was sorta busy and the service was better once i got inside... sadly the food was... bland... i ordered the Machacha plate with corn tortillas... there was a small lake beneath my machacha, the beans were ok as well as the rice.  The tortillas were whatevers also.  It was bad but it was good... i dont think ill be returning... maybe im spoiled cuz im from California... so much better food in CaliGourmet Wok used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant. I live a five minute walk away, and when i craved Chinese, i was lucky to have an affordable and delicious option right nearby. I spent two years looking for an eggroll that wasn't garbage out here, and Gourmet Wok was the first place i found with an eggroll worth eating at a take out place. 

But not anymore. Recently they changed owners, or at least there is a different family working it now. And the quality took a nose dive into an empty pool. The food is pretty meh, a hell of a lot greaser, and the service is much less friendly. The eggroll is still decent, but the general quality of the General Tso, Orange Chicken, and Mongolian beef has just turned bland and not worth it, where it was wonderful before. 

Its still cheap, but i'd go somewhere else for chineese now.Not good at all ! You get a cheap patty, hard bread, and the time it took was crazy long should have went to Wendy's or somethingFirst I should start by saying we go there for the croissants that are served in the bread basket before dinner. They are to die for! We are steak people. Their steaks are marginal at best, taste about like what you find at Smith's. Salads are not very good. Very smoky getting in and out of the place and a lot of elderly gamblers frequent the place.  The waiters seem to hate their jobs and seem to be used to people complaining about the food.  It seems to be no big deal when something is not done properly or people complain about the wait.  Since it appears not many put in reservations there is often a LONG wait for service especially when everyone has the coupons that appear to have been mailed to them for gambling at the establishment. We do still go there and mostly when we are hungry for the amazing Croissants!This is the Wendy's closest to my house, so needless to say, it is the one I most frequently visit. 99% of the time, the service is great. However, this review reflects a single negative visit that will stick in my mind every time I visit one of their restaurants. 

This would have been roughly a year and a half ago. I went to this restaurant with my girlfriend to get some dinner, and ordered (among other things) a vanilla Frosty Shake. When I got to the window, an older, grayish-haired guy was working, and I tried to hand me a chocolate shake.

As nice as possible, I said to the gentleman that it was supposed to be a vanilla shake. The proper thing to do would have been to say "I'm sorry, I'll take care of it for you."

But this guy didn't do that. He SLAMMED the drive-thru window shut in my face, THREW the shake into the garbage as hard as he could, and screamed something at another employee (possibly profanity, I couldn't tell with the window closed.) I have reported this on the company's website and haven't seen this particular employee there since, so that leads me to believe it was taken care of.

Let's be realistic - I'm always going to eat at Wendy's. This is NOT a bad location, but sometimes a bad visit can negatively impact your whole view on a restaurant chain. I still love their food and still go here, though it's going to be hard to think of Wendy's and not think about this experience.Not my favorite airport.  Part of this is my dislike of this airport is the crowd I have to fly with.  My home airport is Ontario so I sometimes come through Vegas on layover.  This means I'm either dropping off the party people of picking them up.  As a business flyer, I just want to sleep, read, or watch my movie.  Not smell the alcohol on the person I just picked up or the obnoxiously loud group getting primed for Sin City.  I do like Vegas and usually come several times a year so don't think it's because I done like the city.

The airport itself is a bit small and lines for everything move pretty slow.  Good and bad thing if you have a long layover is McCarran has slot machines to pass the time.If you make it in for their post 9PM specials (read: $12 steak and lobster tail), then maybe this would be worth your while.  Not for me.  My steak was like a piece of rubber.  My date got something that included a lobster tail and it had to be the smallest lobster tail I have ever seen.  The only thing I liked on my plate was the baked potato.  

Only real plus; the service from our waitress was great.  Even though she was clearly overworked with too many tables, she was very attentive.  I think she was a rare case as everyone else working there (including the miser bale hostess) seemed...well, miserable.  Wont be back.Upgraded to the Gold tower for three nights.{$60 extra June 27-30th}.Saturday night started well. Won $700 at the tables and slots, Saturday night till Sunday Morning there was a loud party next door till 5am.Had to call Security at 4:45..then the hallway doors stopped slamming..yelling and swearing too. Sometimes I think alcohol should be illegal for some yahoos. Thought the Nugget had better clientele, but this was a night from Hell,they took off our $20 upgrade charge for that night..only ruined our whole Sunday as we were exhausted all day. Pool was great Sunday until 4pm..then the alcohol fired up rowdies partied hard. I remember when Vegas was classy,but Frank Dean and Sammy are long gone ,rest in peace,we won't stay here again..to bad..used vto love it here. 5th stay here. Hotels are focused on the revenue from hard drinking,loud,club kids now. JZCame here to watch the Mummy 3 in order to avoid the crowd and labyrinth walkway at the MGM.  Bad decision - the A/C was barely on, seemed like it was off.   Outside was 110 degrees.  The casino was ice cold and enjoyed a margarita at the bar, but inside the cinema was hot and stuffy.   Won't come here again to watch a movie in Vegas but will go through the obstacles at MGM.I went through Expedia to book this hotel. From the website, it seemed so appealing with the amenities that they had to offer including a kitchenette, free shuttle service and a pool.

Well, they all had that stuff...but with a few caveats. The kitchenette from the website included a full size refrigerator. Mine only had a mini-fridge. And as for the free shuttle service, well they only leave once an hour, on the hour to the strip. And as for the pool, it's big enough for old people who booked this hotel/time share.

The rooms were located in an outside environment, so as soon as you walked out of the hallway, you're experiencing outside weather. If it's hot outside, it's also hot in the hallways.

The air conditioning does provide solace inside the rooms. But only when it was on, since it kept cycling on-off throughout my stay there.

There is a "resort-tax," but I guess that's a standard in Vegas, so don't be surprised when you have to pay a little more when you check-in.

Housekeeping service was not offered to us since we only stayed for 2 nights. That was made clear to us when we checked. I guess that's ok?!?

They do have free coffee and bagels in the mornings.

But other than that, I would spend a few dollars more and just stay on the Strip next time.Yikes.  My first impression stepping into this place was roughly 1991.  I'd say it needs an update. But, it looked like some good cheesy fun, and it was. 

Fortunately, I got to the room and saw that the hotel owners must have figured that out and entered into the new millennium with renovations.  The room were huge and really neat and modern - the perfect place for a group of girls who will have their belongings spread out everywhere.... so we thought.

We went to the pool, where the time machine sent us right back to 1991.... Wait... Rewind further... 1989... Quick! Get me my pink Walkman!... Oh, nevermind, I don't need it, there's plenty of 80s music blaring from the less than clear sound system. 

Strangely, they painted parts of the bottom of the pool yellow and orange. I later learned that it is made to look like a clown fish from up above.  Interesting choice.  I get it.  I guess.  It just made the pool look dirty, if you'd ask me.    

So, being a couple of mighty fine females, we got comped back into this century at the special adult only pool - Sapphire.  The pool was legitimately nice, and it had better, newer seating, waterfalls, hot tubs.  If you can get over interesting tattoos and toplessness, it certainly was a better environment than the other pool.  

After a good night of sleep, I got up to treat myself with a massage, which was the best part of my trip so far for sure.  When I was done, I felt so relaxed and went out into the sun. 

For some reason my calves were itchy.  Hmmmmm.... must be sunburn... hmmm... they continued to itch all day and through my redeye flight... hmmmmm..  

When I arrived back home I got a text from my friend, whose mother slept in the same bed I did that night after I did. They had changed the sheets, but she woke up with itchy welts all over her. The hotel switched their room, but didn't do much else.

Check your mattresses folks.  Bedbugs apparently reside anywhere, even places that appear to be clean.  What a nightmare!!!!Way off the strip, it's one of the sketchier casinos I walked though.  It was pretty dark and felt dingy. It's not worth it to go to their buffet either.Love the location. The staff is really nice and helpful.. The Lockers room needs to be cleaned up. It sucks that u have to pay just to use a locker. The pool can be bigger.Had to grow to extra hands to give this place 4 thumbs down. I've been searching for the BEST AYCE.  I still haven't found it.. This place was packed so we walked in thinking this food must be amazing. We ate a little and pushed it to the side. Then we tried to salvage the rest of our money by eating desserts. I gave 2 stars cause the server kept my coke full. Sorry makino wish i enjoyed your food..Qualifier: I didn't have the sushi.  I wasn't really in the mood for sushi so I had the Kalbi dinner special.  Price was reasonable ($12), but the food was mediocre at best.  As with most "combo" style dinners, you get soup, some salad, some California rolls, vegetable tempura, and the entree.  The salad was a small portion of iceberg lettuce with a splash of dressing.  The soup and tempura were average, but the tempura sauce really ruined the tempura.  It wasn't what I'm used to.  Kalbi was dry and really stringy.  Morale of the story: lots of variety with your combo dinner, except none of it was very good.Stayed here over EDC weekend because well, Polo Towers still had availability and was relatively cheap. 

You truly get what you pay for though. The room itself wasn't poorly furnished or anything. The full kitchen was great! But in Vegas, there's a luxury standard that Polo Towers misses which also leads to the service. So you can place a reservation online but you a representative will call you to confirm. And for any other issues, unlike normal hotel concierge, you can only call during business hours. But, now I know what it's like to go through a time share/hotel. 

But to make matters worse, parking was HORRIBLE. The structure itself is poorly laid out and there was hardly any parking available at all hours.I went to Vegas for my birthday and we decided to spend as little as possible on hotel accommodations (but still on the LV strip). And using all those travel websites and deals, we came up with Excalibur, which by the was still not that cheap, but it was a weekend, so prices tend to be higher then.

So up on arrival, things were okay. Free valet is standard at Vegas hotels, so that was good. Once we checked in and went to our room, I was in for a surprise. When I was a kid, I thought Excalibur was the BIGGEST and BESTEST hotel a kid can dream of. Not so much. There was no central air. The rooms were standard size but it seemed kind of musty. One of the handles on the drawers were broken so the hotel staff replaced it with a wire hanger. The ambiance was just not cool. But I guess you get what you pay for. We did end up spending more money on food an  entertainment so I guess it worked out.

But, I don't think I can stay here again.Maybe I went on the wrong weekend or something, but this place was a ghost town. No one was there!  Paul and Chris at the front desk were super friendly, I LOVED them!  The rooms were not bad either.  It seems to stop there though. The webpage was misleading.  It was off of the strip in a sketchy looking area (in comparison to most vegas hotels)  The pool was noisy due to the waterfall and being near the freeway which was somewhat distracting.  I'm not writing this place off completely, but there's a good chance I won't go back or if I do I'll have to try it during the summer season.Pros: hotel room in a good location
Cons: horrendous customer service and the usual drunk Vegas crowd

It's Vegas, so you expect folks to be loud, but we were given a room next to 3-4 women who were so loud that someone else called security on them around 9:30pm.  I would have let that slide, it being only 9:30pm.  The ladies then went out around 10.  At 1:30am, some preciously drunk fellows were going up the hall, having a hard time finding their room because, it turns out, they were on the wrong floor. Hilarious and therefore forgivable.  Around 3am, the ladies next door came home.  One of them vomited, which was clearly audible through the paper-thin walls.  Then she rallied, and, along with the others, decided to continue the party in the room!  What fun for them.  At around 4am, my husband asked them to quiet down, which they declined to do, so we then called the front desk and security, both of whom seemed impatient with us for calling.  Security said they'd send someone up.  At 4:20am, security hadn't yet shown up, and having run out of patience with being unable to sleep, my husband went down to the front desk and persuaded them to let us change rooms and have a late check out so we could get some sleep.  They agreed.  

At 4:27, we left for our new room, and saw security on our way to the elevator.  Bright side: they actually sent someone, albeit with a 27-minute response time.

We later received a bill for about $20 more than the original price of our room.  I called to complain, and after getting out of the voicemail maze, which initially sent me to "Paris" hotel instead of "Harrah's," I received yet a second phone number for billing, where a man named Joe said "sometimes the front desk charges you for things. I couldn't tell you what that's for."  His supervisor assured me that the charge was a surcharge for booking on a debit card (we booked on a credit card).  Then he firmly let me know that we'd be charged the extra money.  So there it is.  A fairly miserable night for $20 more than the original price.  I did appreciate the whole extra one hour of sleep though--so generous of them.

For the love of $20, they guaranteed that I'll never stay in any Harrah's or any of it's affiliate hotels.Beware: Sadly our party of four received food poisoning from the calamari appetizer that wasn't completely cooked. Main dishes of lasagna, lamb shank, linguini with shrimp, and salmon were very good.I'm not one of those people who are too impressed by the fake sky and indoor canal in the venetian, so if that's interesting to you, you might enjoy this place more. I think the food here is good not great. We started with a queso appetizer and added jalapenos to it. It was just huge chunks of jalapeno and very little cheese and almost inedible.

For dinner I had the five tacos. The steak and pork were great, the fish was meh. $5 house margarita for happy hour was nice. 

Good place to stop for a quick lunch but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.Thank goodness our kids are grown and we don't have to stay here or at the Excalibur anymore.

My hubby still has his thing where he HAS to visit the game section and win SOMETHING.  Even after all these years.
This trip, $50 got him this:

*sigh*

In the meantime, I parked myself at a penny Wheel of Fortune to amuse myself.   I'm not crazy about these penny slots, but managed to get a lot of play for just $20.  Nope, didn't win anything.  Just played it down to zero credits for the fun of it.

I'm too much of a grouch for this place.misleading or unclear information on their website regarding pricing. price at stations is not stated on website. beware if you purchase tics for other people, they have a price increase in effect. the monorail itself is great if it goes where you are going. otherwise just cab it. their customer service lacks a little to be desired. very defensive when i tried to discuss website issues. unfortunate how one representative can taint your view of an organization....keep this in mind next time a customer calls....

followup a year later: my son was out here for a few days and we went to the strip, parked at mgm took monorail down to harrahs station. we must have missed the sign (if there was one) saying they were closing at midnight. at 12:02 we discovered we missed the last train (actually us and a bunch of other people) and instead of a $1 ride on the monorail it was a $10 cab back to mgm. sent them a message the next day and to my surprise they replied, apologized for the inconvenience and offered to reimburse my cab expense and a free annual pass....yeah, right...NOT...same as before, no reply says they still don't care.

with my gripes out of the way here is a more complete review - first it is a LONG walk back to the monorail stations. seems slightly less than walking to where you want to go but it is mostly inside and/or covered so either warm or cool depending on the time of the year, that's a plus. the trains and stations are clean and the wait is usually not very long. signs are clear so easy to navigate. if you want to go to the convention center convenient parking at harrahs, mgm or sahara and take the train. sometimes the escalators are not working and it is a LONG walk up/down the stairs to get to ground level. also the handrails at the convention center stop have a tendency to leave your hands soiled. it would get 5 stars no matter what else if it went downtown or to the airport....sadly no. if you are going to the wynn, or sands convention center be prepared for a long walk from the nearest station which i think is harrahs. i am not sure why but the entrance gates are not real intuitive, you will set off sirens if you do it wrong. kind of funny. my problem is after riding bart for years, it keeps your ticket when it is empty, not lvmonorail, you have to take the empty ticket out and throw it away yourself (ahh sirens.)  for locals it is a good value, thats why they earned the second star. (except when they close early and don't tell you!)I really wanted to put one star, but the manager lady was fair enough and partially resolved a problem I had there. My stay at Vegas this week, I looked up their website's menu and the price excited me seeing it was better than other place. As the saying goes, "not all cheap things are great." 

First let me say there was this Asian man who took my order, who was a little rude. He did not really listen to what I had to say, and he came to me with the check when we were done and literally coughed without covering his mouth on my face, and told me "the suggested gratuity is 20%" and that I should pay this amount. It was just a party of two, and our total came out to around $50, so the gratuity suggested of $9. 

All well known and better restaurants say at the bottom of all their menus that an 18% gratuity is automatically added to the bill of "parties of 8 or more." He was telling me to pay a "20% gratuity" of only a party of two.

Okay, it's not just that, I was really disappointed in the food as well. While I was eating, I kept thinking that I rather be eating panda express. It's the worse dinner, and course of meal i've ever had especially I'm eating in Vegas. I wanted what I imagined to be vegetable stir fry, but the guy who took my order, before I could spot it on the menu, said it as "salt and pepper" which I didn't catch with the accent, and speaking fast before I could finish ordering, sorry that had to be mentioned. You can say I was pretty wrong to assume he understands what I wanted. What i had was an appetizer like menu which costed more than a similar appetizer menu I had. There were 2 salt and pepper menu in front of me, because I had also ordered a calamari salt and pepper. I should've made sure, but when the food came I just couldn't satisfy my hunger, because it was plain weird and salty. 

Of course it was weird, because I got something different than what I really wanted to order.

I wanted to pay for everything and accept my fault, until the server placed the receipt, coughed on my face, and told me to pay a 20% gratuity which no restaurant had ever done to their customer. You simple leave the check, walk out, and whatever you get, you get. Since he was rude I thought I'd speak up about what I didn't like, so an Asian manager lady gave me a half price off the wrong order made. You can say it was better than paying a big price for something you didn't like.Warning: After living in Italy for 3 yrs and having an Italian Mother in law, I am an Italian food snob. Better to have high standards than none!

Honestly- this place is way over priced and the food not so good. Only good thing going was the decor and the ambiance.

Here's the breakdown:
1. Food way over priced. Yes, you get salad or soup, garlic bread and free red & white wine. But when you're paying min. $21, the main entree better taste good. And it didn't. Granted the portions are HUGE but still not worth if if the food is bad.
2. I ordered the linguini seafood- the seafood part was good but the sauce was bland and tasted too much like tomato paste. The pasta itself was way too al dente. 
3. My sister ordered the cheese ravioli- the sauce was also way too bland and there was too much sauce on the dish. 
4. For dessert, we sampled the cheesecake- tasted like a frozen cheesecake from a local grocery store. 
5. The "cappucino" is really not cappucino. It's more like hot chocolate. Also, as an Italian restaurant, the owners should know better- in Italy, cappucino is a breakfast drink. In the evenings, one drinks espresso with or without liquor in it. 
6. Nothing special about the salad or the wines. I can definintely say I have had better wines.
7. The guy with the accordion was a little creepy.

I would never recommend this place to anyone other than to walk past it.Some of my girlfriends coworkers recently invited us to join them here to sing karaoke. 

Many years ago this was a great little place called the Village Pub. That was back in the 70s. I once had dinner with Joyce Dewitt here.

Well the days of dining with celebrities here are long gone. Let's flash ahead 30 plus years to my current review.

I work down on the strip and knowing the kind of riff raff that hangs out around here I wasn't expecting much from this experience. As soon as I stepped into the place my expectations were fulfilled. The place was dingy and crowed with the typical prostitutes, drug pushers, losers and other assorted parasites of society you'd expect to see in a bad part of town.

The place has the worst sound system of any karaoke bar I've ever visited.

The staff was slow and seemed bored with their jobs.

Despite all these positive attributes I think I'll refrain from visiting again.D.U.M.P.


Sticky floors and slot areas. The $200 worth of slot credits were for the promotional machines only and they were gross. I felt like I needed to bathe in Purell afterwards. 

For this kind of sleeze, I would stick with Mermaids or Four Queens on Fremont Street.Blah!  Just walking into this establishment, really doesn't impress me.  I went here for my Parents. Granted, I'm not a motorcycle fan, but trust me, my 2 star review is not based on that.  First of all, the restaurant does not have any kind of pleasing aesthetic visual appeal at all.  We got seated by this huge wall of chains, which were caked in about 5 years of dust.  

Motorcycles are on a conveyor overhead, which was kind of cool I guess.  However, the service and food were average to a bit below average.  Your normal Hard Rock Cafe/Planet Hollywood type of fare -- but really nothing tasty about it.  The service was very slow as well....very few servers for a packed restaurant.  

There is a first and last time for anything, and this was the last.I went there for the first time about 7 years ago and had a much better experience.  This time is was heavy on the UGLY and not worth the free cover we got.Not great in terms of the hotel itself, but decent location off the strip puts you right in the middle and walks to the Wynn, the Venetian, the Billagio, and Caesers are all manageable. 

This is a typical Westin experience with Heavenly xyz, etc. but a bit more beat up then a typical Westin. 

If you're going to spend your day in the sun, you can probably do better at the strip casinos who have massive pools. The Westin's was like an oversized bath tub and was dirty with a nice oil slick on top to boot. Its casino was also small and rarely buzzing, but they do keep minimums at the black jack tables low which means you lose your money much slower here. They were also playing really mellow music; it felt like sitting in a coffee house than a casino. 

Finally I must mention the ants in our room. Tiny red ants first spotted in the bathroom then in the carpeting in the room. Basically the longer we stayed in the room the more ant havens we found. When we checked out we got some charges taken off our room and were told the room would be "deep cleaned" but lodgers beware: probably best to keep your baggage off the floor lest you bring home the bastards to what are surely all spotless homes.After a 30-minute wait in line, we were seated. The time passed quickly for my daughter as there was a lot to look at - not so fast for me because I was hungry.

I ordered the turkey sandwich that did a number on my stomach a couple hours later. Thankfully, it was quick and painless. I'm even more thankful that the Bellagio has easily accessible bathrooms throughout their hotel.

Service was prompt and courteous. The child-friendly vibe was appreciated, but the exorbitant prices were not. Kids meals start at $9.99 and a basic burger will run $15. In my opinion, not worth the trouble when there are other options nearby.Great for kids, but awful for any adults with functioning taste buds. It was my kid's birthday and I thought he'd like it because of the animatronic animals and all. He did. He got a big kick out of them, the sound effects, thunder, and faux jungle decorations. For dinner he got dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets. Surprisingly, they're the same kind that you can get at most grocery stores for a fraction of the price. Everything here is over priced. It's a huge tourist trap. Even after my wife and I split an entree we still paid a fortune.

This is a Landry's restaurant. The same company behind the Chart House, Claim Jumper, McCormick and Schmick's, and other  similar spots. As a big corporation, you can see many of the cost-cutting measures they take -- frozen mozzarella sticks, cheap salad dressing, chicken that probably comes from massive feeding/farming plants that documentaries warn us about, rice that is no better than Uncle Ben's, etc. All the ingredients felt and tasted cheap.

The service, however, was great. Our waitress was so nice and friendly and added to my kid's birthday dinner experience. I hear they're going to close this place sometime this year. I'm not surprised. At least it will force me to take my kid someplace else for his bday next year.The music is a variety the drinks are mostly juice. I orders two cranberry and vodka at $7 each and they where both watered down w little vodka. Also we ordered buckets of beer but every time we stood up to dance the staff would clear the tables even with beer still in the bottles. We literally could not leave our table without bottles jacked!Oh!  Not good for us!  We came in on a Friday night, around 9ish.  The place was empty and our table was sticky.  2 stars for attentive service but the food????   With so many other choices why go here?Always need the Stingman (which is not on the menu), but tonight service was slow  and many of the rolls got to us just soaking in the special sauces, making the rice fall apart and the flavors indistinct.   The hand roll nori was chewy, as if it had been sitting a long time too.  It will be a while before we return.I have to say, I was beyond disappointed coming back here. In 7 years, the food has gone completely downhill and the prices have skyrocketed.

Came on a Saturday night, around 9p. We were starving, btw, so at that point even the table looked appetizing. The place was totally DEAD! 9p...Saturday night...VEGAS!? Even for being a little late and off the strip, this is a huge sign that the place isn't doing well. 

Absolutely gorgeous ambiance. Greeted by a very sweet gentleman; he claimed to be the sommelier (but he was also playing host.. Hmm.. Another sign?) Sat at a very comfortable booth facing the large windows with a beautiful view. Reminded me of Top of the World at the Stratosphere (without the spinning).

The waiter came to greet us, told us about a few specials and that they were out of quite a few items. Together we ordered two Caesar salads, one cup of soup, the shrimp and scallop ravioli and two glasses of wine (Grand total, $103).

Salads came out freezing cold, we were not offered fresh ground pepper, had to ask TWICE, because the salads came out at different times. I've had a better Caesar in a plastic to-go container at an airport. Cheap, shitty lettuce and thick, super mayonnaise-y dressing. I was so unimpressed with the ravioli; it tasted like something you'd get at the Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill. With a $30 price tag! Are they out of their damn minds?!

I recommend going somewhere else for dinner. There are SOOO many fantastic restaurants in Vegas, and if you're going to spend that much, you may as well enjoy it.silly me went to the reef aquarium at mandalay bay . which is good . while buying my admission ticket i was given a free coupoun for a free maragretia drink with my dinner. so i was like ok i will try this over priced mexican resturant.  oh snap this place is a rip off. while waiting a long time for my free drink which wasnt very good i ran out of salsa and one of the bus boys aksed me if i want gaucolmole so i said yes thinking it was free dip. like the old saying goes theres a sucker born ever minute and im living proof of that. they hustled me in a resturant . i still cant believe i got coned . 

the gaucolmole was $ 9.00 plus tax . my bill came out $ 25.89 including tax . it should of dawned on me why  on a saturday about 6:00 p.m. when i left the place it wasnt crowded and less then  half full. the food was good but not worth double the price of planet hollywood. i said to myself before i even went to this hotel i wasnt going to eat there because its so expensive.... 

" note to john P.  -------- follow john P.'s advice and eat denny's instead of this highway robbery  "As teriyaki chicken rice bowls go, this place has an okay one at a reasonable price, especially on the student special.  It's nothing spectacular, but it's filling enough.  Maybe I'll return to try something more interesting, but I'm not in a huge hurry to do so.
I hate downgrading, but today's visit was kind of icky.  I had a student special again, this time with added vegetables.  They drowned the vegetables in more gooey teriyaki sauce (the chicken bowl last time had just enough to be tasty), and they were blah vegetables (celery and cabbage, just short of overcooked) at that.Honestly, I've been here before and I really enjoyed it the first time; but this last time....how do you keep running out of fried chicken?  Ahh...when I did have the opportunity to taste the fried chicken, it was like home cooking.  So crunchy, just the right amount of seasoning...truly grubb'n!  Now, I wonder if that was fluke, since the katsu was ok and my husband's tapsilog did not hit the spot.  

The saving grace was the Adobo fried rice omelet.  sorry, that's what's up with this spot.I tried to use my Groupon here and went to the store 4 times before eventually giving up and getting a refund.  If I wanted to dress like someone in their 70s I could probably do it a lot cheaper and without having to sort through a hundred stuffed racks of crap.A friend and I were going to go to Garduno's for lunch, but when we got to Texas Station, we saw a sign that reminded her it was only open for dinner!  Total bummer.  

We wanted to have some really great Mexican food for lunch but weren't sure of another good restaurant in the Northwest.  I'm still relatively new to town (as far as going out is concerned).  I was trying to install the Yelp app on my phone but it wouldn't install, and my phone died before I could find another good place nearby.  

So we decided we would try Dona Maria Tamales.  The salsa seemed fresh and was really flavorful - it had a nice bit of spice to it, too.  (It always gives me a good impression when the chips and salsa are good so I was looking forward to our lunch.) 

I ordered the two tamale lunch (one pork with red sauce and one cheese with green chiles) and a tea.  My friend ordered the enchilada lunch with a chile relleno and a pink lemonade.  Our server was timely and polite for the most part, even though for a while during my lunch I had to wait for more tea before I was able to finish my food.

Apparently there was supposed to be some sauce on my tamales?  (Is that a fact?)  Well, there wasn't any, and they tasted pretty bland.  I was disappointed because my "cheese and green chile" tamale had chicken in it and no green chiles to be found - it was literally flavorless and generally unpalatable.  The "red pork" tamale just had pork in it - where was the red sauce, filler, simmer sauce, where was "red" anything?

My friend said she was less than impressed with her enchilada and chile relleno.  She let me have a bite of her chile relleno and it tasted about 20x better than my tamales - lucky her!  I ended up dumping half of the container of salsa on my tamales, and that barely helped.  The rice and beans were just standard fare - refried beans with some cheese on top and kind of tomatoey rice.  (I really don't like stewed tomato flavor anything). 

Anyway, if you get the tamales without the sauce, or the "green chile" cheese tamale without green chiles and some random chicken in it you didn't ask for or really enjoy, and you have the time (unfortunately today I didn't) - send 'em back if they'll let you and get something else! Maybe some of the seafood dishes here or dinner courses are better, I haven't tried them, but with our experience today, it isn't likely that either of us will return any time soon.This place is big and the definitely have nice selection of everything.  
Problem is that their prices are to high. 
Everything there is so expensive and makes no since.  
A lot of their products you can find  also at Walmart for 30% less. 
They are lucky they don't have a lot of competition.Okay, I understand that sushi bars in Vegas feel a real pressure to offer an all-you-can-eat special to their customers, it's important to remain competitive in this sushi saturated market - but one gets the impression that Kobe really despises this simple fact. 

Sure they're not the only sushi bar that charges more for single serve items (after all they have to make up the difference) - but those customers that do decide to order off the single serve menu expect some sort of value for their dollar.

My fare included one roll, one pair of tuna nigiri and a seafood salad. With a glass of water my bill came to an astonishing $35 plus tax and tip. The roll was the least appetizing of all three, with an over-whelming amount of vinegar doused over the entire roll making the rice fall apart as I picked it up - plus everything tasted like vinegar and I could not taste the fish at all. The nigiri was okay, even though the portion of fish was tiny. The seafood salad was quite good, but when I inevitably compare it to similar offerings at other sushi bars around town, it seemed - well, small.

I was not very hungry, which explains the decision to go piece meal (so to speak), but after the three offerings from Kobe I was left feeling unsatisfied. If I had only paid $10 less and had the all-you-can-eat I would have at least been filled up - but at what cost?The breakfast was very disappointing. I have not had any other meals here. However their desserts: cookies and pies are yummy. I don't think i would ever buy a meal here again. However i will stop in for a cookie or 2 ;)If you're a dude, stay away from this place.....

Unless you're in the mood for a cat fight, you can see some of those here for sure.

I've only ever been here with girlfriends, the guys section is only awesome if you dress like a 70 year old.  Guys, stick to Nordstroms Rack, this place isn't worth the one tie you may find here.

That being said if you're a girl, you'll apparently find some smoking deals on occasion.  I've heard enough squeals of delight around this place to know it's the truth.Went to Mike's tonight for the first time with my wife.  Nice little mom and pop run atmosphere...and thus ends anything worth writing home about.  Don't get me wrong - it wasn't bad.  Just wasn't great.

My wife and I are 25.  What does that mean?  Instant assumption that our tip is going to be low.  What does that result in?  Our waitress catering to a big table next to ours (she visited 3 times before coming to greet us - as in pick up plates and talk, come back offer dessert and talk, then come back to talk to some more) over ours.  I've worked in the restaurant industry.  I know how it goes.  Their ticket was higher, their tip is thus higher.  Reasonable to assume it should take 5 minutes to greet?  Eh. 

Food was so/so.  At a plate average of somewhere around $12 it was a bit expensive.  I'd frequent if it were somewhere around $8.  Though it's doubtful I'll ever try this place again perhaps I ordered the wrong item.  The chicken in the chicken kalamata was very much on the tough side.  Sort of the consistency of chicken that has been rewarmed after it is initially cooked.  Not worth the $12.99.  Coulda/shoulda been around $6.99.

Not a bad evening though could have been better.  I had high hopes for Mike's!  Atmosphere was nice and the food was alright but it's doubtful I'll be returning anytime soon - at least until I'm  over the age of 40 and garner a little respect from the waitstaff.If you want to stay at a hotel on the strip stay away from the Stratosphere. It is the last hotel on the strip and too far walk to and from. Sure the place is cheaper then the rest but its not worth it.A very tired, basic, budget casino.  I only stayed there because of the $35 room I managed to secure.
Best thing to do when traveling cheap, get a room at a place like this, and only come back there to sleep.
The tower itself offers only one attraction, the top of the stratosphere, which has a restaurant and a cool looking roller coaster.  However, even to go up and have a look, the fee is $13.  Which, even for a hotel guest, isn't really worth it, unless this is your first and only time in Vegas.No return business from me...  

Pros: low rates and pretty friendly staff

Cons:
1. Technically on the strip, but nowhere near where the action is
2. Nickel-and-dime system... I've never been in a hotel that not only doesn't provide guests a free kiosk to print boarding passes, but also charges $5 for the concierge to deliver a faxed or emailed pass
3. My mom ate the food and reported it was of a low quality
4. In the shady part of town
5. TV was faulty, no luggage stand

Was in one of the remodeled rooms and it was decent, but far below stellar.

Full disclosure: before coming over to this hotel for a little family reunion I was in a suite at the Cosmopolitan. This Stratosphere place can't possibly compete with that--no way (can't hold a candle to it).

If you're on a tight budget perhaps, but otherwise...  next time I'm staying ensconced at the Cosmo.

Note: one of the hotel staff--embarrassed that having to charge to print boarding passes--did it for free.Limited menu. Trying to be too hipster. Prices are too high for what you get.Oh Denny's.  You might be open 24/7, therefore being the only place to get some greasy grub after a Labor Day party, but you have done me wrong.

Why just one waiter for 12 tables? Why Denny's? Why?

And why was there a chunk of wrapper from a stick of butter in my eggs? Why?  

sad face.= = = = = =  THIS REVIEW IS FOR PETER PIPER'S WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =

I received an "All you can eat for $3.99" coupon in the mail for this place, & that was enough to vacuum me in to try it for lunch today.  I found it to be clean, friendly, & reasonably comfortable, with booths along two sides & glare-free lighting.

There was a choice of 3 ok pre-tossed salads, real plates (I don't like picnic plates in a restaurant!), & good, sturdy plastic tableware.  Then it was on to the pizza, though.  Uh-oh.    :-O

This place has their heart in the right place, & the prices are certainly great, but the pizza is so blah I just don't think it's worth bothering with.I used to like you Palms.  But I think we have to break up. 
It wasn't very nice of you to charge my card for a deposit on a non smoking room and then shove me in a dingy, smoking optional room in the old tower when I arrive.  I used to sell mortgages so I know all about the bait and switch.  I also know that for what you charge I can get a better experience elsewhere.  And the Ghost Bar kinds sucks these days.  But you know what?  I was still going to check it out until you tried to charge me a $30 cover at 3 am.  Come on.  That's just silly.  I wish you well, Palms, but I think we're better off just being friends.  No more overnights.This casino used to be 5 stars but is in dire need for further renovations or other ways to drive traffic back to this casino.My first and last stay at the Bellagio. I booked 3 rooms, months in advance for my daughter 40th. Birthday. Since, our arrival  everyone had  an attitude or was rude to us.  Maybe they are been treated bad who knows. At check-in the blond older lady with her I-pad on hand kept telling me to go away. Check out here in Vegas is not until 3 pm she keep repiting. Maybe because the color of my skin did not match hers. She probably taught I did not understand . Next, when we got to,the rooms the mini-bars were a mess.  Bottle water half way used. Have of a sandwich in the fridge. We called front desk to let them know nothing happen.  The only good service we got at he Bellagio Cafe, give all the people that work there 6 stars. The service was more then excellent.  I give the Bellagio 2 stars.  I have always stay at  theAriaor the Wynn I should stay with what I know.  Bad,bad service. Make your employees happy. Management most be doing something wrong to their people because they are not happy campers .Like the other nearby casinos, it has the ceiling with the blue sky and the shops/eateries are supposed to resemble a neighborhood in Paris.

Ehh, what can I say? Paris is boring. Nothing really special. Just a nice walkthrough casino for air conditioning, so you don't have to walk outside in the blazing heat. Oh and it's also pretty to take pictures of.Just trying out new hotels on the strip.  So far my ratings go as follows:
1. Bellagio - Very Nice, but also very pricey.
2. New York, New York - comfortable and you don't even need to leave the hotel.  It has everything you need here.
3. Excallibur - Been a long time, but I remember that it was a pretty decent place.
4. Bally's - Can you believe it... for as old as it is, it beat out the Paris.  Better spa, better pool area and the pool was not as frigid as the Paris.
5. Paris - The tower was cool, but not cool enough for me to spend $19 per person to just go to the top.  Also, the pool was extremely frigid.  Everyone that was getting into the pool, was also getting out right away, or just dipping their feet in.  Even on one of the 100+ degree days the pool felt like iceberg water.  They did have good drinks at the casino bar, and the rooms were standard.So far not impressed :(. Wanted to stay here for Sooo many years. We are here with a large group of family to celebrate a 21st bday. First off the lady who checked us in was so rude. AND checking in at 2pm they charge $15! I've been coming to Vegas my whole life and this has NEVER happened, really?? On top of the $20 resort fee?? Really? And the lady could care less. Our second room couldn't be on the same floor either. Oh could we get a view? $30 bucks. Now to the room...old, dingy, bathroom run down with hard water crusted around the shower. I'm shocked and disappointed so far :(.If you can't fall asleep after too much Vegas stimulation, just look at the tired atmosphere around this place and you'll be nodding off in no time.  Good news is it's attached to Aria and very close to MGM Grand and New York New YorkIt took us 1.5 hours to get our rooms. My friend had arrived earlier and got confirmation on our 2 connecting rooms. She was even shown on the map where they were so it was frustrating to have to wait for that to get sorted out when we checked in 1 hour later. Before we even got to our rooms, we'd realized that they were not "close" to the elevator as requested. "Close" isn't at the end of the hall. While we waited for the bellboy to get our luggage to be transferred to another set of rooms, a family opened the door to one of our rooms. They were rather fast in giving away our rooms.

When we got to the new set of rooms, we found out that they weren't connected. The front desk checked and said, "Oh, you're right, they're not connected." Finally, we were given 2 connecting rooms close to the elevator. The front desk informed us that she had to take those away from someone else. Well, in fact, those turned out to the original rooms promised to us about 2.5 hours ago. 

When we came back that evening, we found that they had left a bottle of champagne in each of the rooms. Also, they comped us the first night which was the most expensive. Nonetheless, it was a pain to lose time when we had so much packed into each night. We didn't get to eat dinner together because we had to split up to pick up tickets here and there. 

The $20/night resort fee is supposed to cover morning papers (YOU pick them up at the front desk or at the store), wireless (can get really slow), bathrobes, printing of boarding passes...when I requested the bathrobes, they brought up ONE per room. We had 2 people per room so I suppose they expected us to share. 

We didn't use any of the cleaning service and instead, we swapped dirty towels for clean ones ourselves. One of the cleaning person, a man, was so rude when I asked for toilet paper. He just ignored me and when I asked again, he said, "No." 

I still like the pool because there weren't any pool parties. When I go to the pool, I like to relax instead of fighting for a spot to lie down or be exposed to loud club music. On one of our last days, there was an "accident" so everyone had to evacuate the pool while they cleaned and removed the evidence. 

Going to the Wynn was such a contrast. The noise on the casino floor was pretty irritating at the Mirage and I'm sure that's the same pretty much everywhere else. I have to say that I'm glad we stayed at the Mirage this time because it was pretty central to everywhere we wanted to go to and we got to see Criss Angel on one of our late night visit to BLT.

I don't know about the $5 taxi ride everywhere because we got long hauled everywhere we went. It was annoying and I did report a couple of them to the taxi authority. Not only did they long hauled us, a couple gave us attitude. I really hate the taxi drivers there.I still have a soft spot in my heart for the mirage but it's only a shadow of its former self. The pool is great though.Pirate show is great...
Well, it's great if you have kids.
No, I don't have kids.Great location, but that's about it. 

If youre looking for a hotel in this part of the strip but dont want to pay to stay at the Wynn, Venetian, or Palazzo, then consider spending a little more per night for the Mirage, you will be glad you did.

The Mirage is 100 times nicer and less touristy/cheesy.We got a suite here whilst driving to California last minute as the price was really good (it was $120 as it was a Sunday night).

Was very disapointed with the room as it as very dated and old. The lighting in the room was not the best and the barthroom felt like it had not been updated since the 1960's.

I would have expected something a bit better considering TI is listed as a 4*.Awful!

My family and I and casual travelers ( we only go to Vegas, eh) and we have experienced INCREDIBLE Services at older hotels ( we've stayed in almost 75% of Vegas Strip Casino Hotels), but at this one, the hotel with the slogan Forever Fabulous, wasn't very Fabulous at all. My Father decided to stay in this hotel because of what he heard about the amazing pools, and the great rate he had received, 129 per night with 2 queen beds, hot tub, HD flat screen. Flamingo, didn't do their end of the bargain. The room we were originally given was extremely small, 2 SINGLE beds, a TV from the era where they were barely beginning to have color, broken shower, and the room smelled like weed, and failed to meet hygienic standards. Of course my father went down to complain, in return we got, a slightly bigger room with furnishings, same bathroom style, no HD TV still, Slightly bigger double beds, AC and heating failed to work, ( around 110 degrees outside, but in our room it was around 50) but the room was allot cleaner.The next day: my old man, having double hip replacement, and the fact that there are 4 of us so we have to share beds, fueled us to go down there, with the copy of the website we had purchased the rooms from, with the description. Again, they moved us to a different room, but this time charging us an Extra $35 a night! Our next room wasn't much better than our last in terms of sanitation and maintenance. Again, we went down to complain, and back up we came again, this time we actually got the room we paid for, everything that was described and more ( TV in the bathroom:P). Now enough about the rooms and service. The pool :  We heard it was beautiful, We saw it was beautiful, but if you came here for a family fun experience, your not going to get it. The pools are 3 sections, all 3 linked through slides and ladders, and walkways of course. 2 of the sections are particularly small, as in, community pools are bigger. and the 3rd one, was enormous,huge, clean, and only for 18 years and older........ HUGE drawback, most people go to pools because they have children with them. Me being 16, but having an awesome mustache, walked right in, later being escorted out by security.... While I was in though, I noticed, THE POOL WAS LESS THAN 10% POPULATED, while the other pools were Stuffed, and there was even lines to get in ( Only hotel guests can enter pools also). There was more attractions for kids in the Go Pool( 18+ pool) than in the others. That, the fact that they kick you out of the pool at dusk, and $25 margaritas is a HUGE drawback for guests. 

Now for Food

Sadly, I did not get to eat at the buffet in the Flamingo, which is slightly more overpriced that other hotels. There's also a Burger Joint, called Burger Joint (clever huh), I also failed to eat there. But behind the casino there's a food court, They have an AMAZING pizza place, ( overpriced though) a Johnny Rockets (overpriced as well) and a NYSubs.

Shows= I only watched one show, it was endorsed by flamingo, but was shown in the Bar O'Sheas next door, it was Wild Magic with a guy whos name i forgot. Absolutely Fantastic, the stage is tiney, when i walked in i'm thinking to myself, "wtf did i get myself into" The show though, turned out to be great, you get so close to wild big cats that it almost feels like they are going to eat you, This is the only reason im giving flamingo 2 stars instead of 1.


Well, I hope my review helped you make your decision on where to stay (stratosphere and Luxor are for great for small budget decisions)

Check me out on youtube ( Has nothing to do with reviews what so ever, just throwing it out there) 

www.Youtube.com/darproductionI stayed here last summer (a little late to write a review, but here goes). When I stayed, they were doing endless construction inside The Luxor--which was really annoying. Hopefully that is completed by now.

The rooms are spacious, the bathroom was ok (just a shower). The restaurants weren't anything to write home about. I was there in July, so it was very very hot and I don't think the AC worked all that well. The room was pretty stifling. But maybe that was because the entire hotel is a giant window??

I used the spa and got a massage, which was pretty good. Using their spa gets you a free day pass to the gym. That was nice. The pool was pretty great too--except there's not much shade. So be prepared.

The tram connection is excellent, and it's nice being close to Mandalay Bay. The Luxor is ok. It was affordable. I supposed I'd stay there again if I had to.I stayed at the Luxor Hotel and it is showing its age. The plumbing system was very noisey and the drapes were stained. The price is great for the strip however, I would rather pay more to have something nice.Takes a long time to check in, and they forgot to give us keys, so we had to go through the line again. I felt the check-in lady was kind of sarcastic.

Decoration is pretty good, but not as impressive as a lot of the other hotels. The pyramid looks cool from the outside, especially at night, but you won't really see it when you walk around on the strip.

We stayed in the west tower. The rooms are better than the pyramid rooms but it's a hike to get to the elevator. The walls are pretty thin, especially toward the hallway. If there are any people talking in the hallway anywhere near your room you'll hear every word. You can hear muffled talking through the walls to the next room, but not as bad as the hallway. The tower rooms have a safe, which was a good size and made us feel better about our stuff being secure.

Compared to other hotels, it doesn't take as long to learn the layout, but it has just as many people bothering you with timeshares and other junk when you try to walk anywhere. The lobby stinks (literally) -- smells much worse than the other hotels.

It can be tricky to get to the strip where you want to go. There's a tram but you have to go north to Excalibur before it'll take you south to Mandalay Bay. It's a pain coming back because you have to go past Luxor to Mandalay Bay to get back. It's most of the way on the south end of the strip so it's a long trek to reach places with shows like Bellagio and Venetian.

Wired internet for some reason. The cable comes out of the entertainment center so you can't even use it at the desk.

Limited dining options. Pretty small number of restaurants (but three Starbucks). Restaurants are probably still cheaper than other hotels. Backstage Deli was alright, lower price than a lot of Vegas food, and pretty good.

The price is low, but I still didn't feel like it was a great value.Had a good experience staying here last year. 

Cheap hotel. If you need a place to crash on the strip that still connects to other hotels. This might be your spot.

If you like walking around the corners of the pyramid to reach broken elevators, then this might be your spot.

Stay away from the LOBBY BAR! and the starbucks closest to the Excalibur walkway.
Nothing but attitude and crappy drinks at those places.

This pyramid could use an upgrade as far as : staff, decor, and accessibility.  Way over due!!  

Oooohhh the last thing I must say, is avoid all the people in black suits with nametags asking "Where are you from?", or "Do you want to see a free show?" These are time-share hounds looking for unsuspecting visitors trying to find the registration desk.  They sadly fool so many tourists into thinking a worker is being friendly and helping them get checked in.  Once you realize they are trying to sell something, simply say "I have no money", and watch their personality do a 180.

these hustlers need to be banned from hotels.We were terribly disappointed by our first visit. Average steaks and service, with a hefty price tag. After hearing stellar reviews and dozens of praises we gave it another go and had their seasonal tasting menu.

Overall, our second Craftsteak experience was better than the first. We've had years in between visits, I noticed the regular menu had been completely redone. Still we failed to see what warrants the praises the restaurant receives. There are too many other steakhouses that offer better tasting quality meats and more creative menus. We don't believe Craftsteak deserves a third chance. We have no intentions to return.I was in Las Vegas for a bachelorette party last weekend. We were excited for our first night out and a fancy dinner. Our salads were delicious and that's where the good stops. I decided to splurge and order the ribeye which is $50 a la carte and goes against my whole being because that is a ridiculous price. I thought "hey why not it's vegas?" I ordered my steak rare....it was overcooked and not seasoned well at all. I ordered a side of the fingerling potatoes with rosemary. I got little baby potatoes with a couple sprigs of rosemary on top. It was like one of those horrible dishes your grandmother throws together to make dinner seem fancy. It was very hard to hand over my portion of the bill when at home I can go down the street and order a 16oz Ribeye that comes with a baked potato and side salad for $9.95 (and it's the best damn steak I've ever had); I actually went there when I flew in to cheer up. 

Out of 5 of us only one liked their dinner; which happened to be the bachelorette so we were happy. Another one of us ordered the beef tartar and it came with something like bagel chips instead of a sliced baguette. When she asked the server if they had a sliced baguette she looked at her like she was insane; left for maybe a minute and then came back saying "they just couldn't do it".  VERY RUDE! 

We ended up taking our leftovers hoping we would see a homeless person to give them to. 

We also thought it was ironic that the owner of this restaurant is so judgemental on his show, yet this was a terrible dinner.This is a hard review to score. 

Went twice in one week - once as a group of 6  and once as a romantic twosome.

The group meal was fun - spent $4K on wine - had the tasting menu which was chaotic but pretty good.  Not GREAT tho. The sommelier was FANTASTIC.  Say 3 stars.

The romantic birthday dinner was a puzzle. Again - The sommelier - another guy - was FANTASTIC.

Our waiter was the pits. Bread, then menus, still on drinks when food starts to arrive, not a single "how is everything check in" and then the topper - walking quickly by our table - drops the cheque and continues on. NOT. ONE. WORD.

If we were demanding loud jerks I wold sort of understand. BUt we are not. We are Canadians for heaven's sakes. :)

For about $350pp you expect better.After missing brunch the last time we went to Vegas, I was determined to make it there this time.  I thought my husband would be happy because he loves pastries and people rave about Bouchon pastries.
  The ambiance is beautiful of course, your in the Venetian, but the service was a tad off and the food did not make up for it.  I had the croque madame, which was pretty good with a ton o fries.  But I felt bad for the hubby.  He ordered the breakfast americaine and you could see more of the plate than food.  And he said the cheese danish from the random coffee shop in another hotel was better.

So this was a definite miss, and for the price and quality I would go to Grand Lux any day.  At least you get a good portion for what you pay.Great food scuttled by a hour wait for brunch dishes which came out 5 minutes apart.

It was a 20 min wait for brunch on a sunday, so not too bad and we ordered drinks, pastries and mains.  They ran out of one so we subbed another and they were truly astounding but then it took an hour for mussels, chicken and waffles and a tuna sandwich.  Each dish was exceptional but an hour wait in a half empty restaurant when other tables get the same dishes ahead of you and they come out 5 minutes apart is just poor.  The waitress was great, empathetic and had a manager come over who comped a round of drinks which was nice but the experience wasn't close to what i was expecting from a Keller establishment.  Food saved the experience but they need to hire an expediter.  Thankfully we had the time to spend from 1 until 3 waiting for brunch but it should be better and i hope they make changes.

great food and hope they just had a rough day.Decor is nice. The food looks nice but it was only ok. Our waitress was unhappy but she did switch an order for us when the goat cheese dumplings tasted like a Marie calendars tv dinner. I had the scallops with an unimpressive salty sauce. The table is too Small for anything so you have a big clutter of things in front of you. The prices are too high. This place is in between all your Chanel and armani stores so it's great for tourists who don't know much about food but came to spend money. I would not come here again it was only ok. The hostess in the front had a snobby demeanor she could of fooled me and made me think we were going into a Michelin star restaurant. Quite the contrary...I had a very high hopes for Olives. It is a beautiful place and the fountains certainly add a lot of drama. The Bellagio is a lovely if somewhat dated hotel. 

I'm not sure why I tried the free range chicken but it was as extremely dry with very little flavor.  Michael had some kind of steak but it looked frightening to me so I decided against trying it. 

They were busy and maybe it was an off night. Not on my list of places to revisit. 

For the price of this meal, I expected something wonderful. Palatable would also have been acceptable.Absolutely NO guest PARKING here!   You are forced to Valet Park your car:(  and if you stay too late, they move your car across town and you will never find it until the next day!  be extremely careful when you patronize this establishment!  Do Not hand your keys to anyone!!  You have been warned!!   But they do have good food!I have a lot of friends that love it here. If you're one of them, you might not want to read the rest of this review.

It just wasn't good.

I think the host was doubling as out server... I can't be sure though since we only saw her twice. A different person brought out our food every time.

The food was bad: Skunky wine, chewy calamari, soggy pizza, and most tragically, dry pork belly with pretty much zero fat on it.

The best part of the meal was a side of green beans. I guess I really recommend getting an order of the green beans if you come here.The entrance to Pure was mobbed with people. We had made previous arrangements with a staff member to get our large party (14, mostly girls) inside. It was nearly impossible with the poor line control.

We finally made it inside but were quite disappointed. The primary downstairs area was extremely packed and too dark. The open air dance floor upstairs was much better.

I don't want to sound snobby, but... the bouncers seem to let everyone. There were also quite a few extremely drunk individuals that I would have expected to be escorted out, if anyone had been paying attention.Went last nite.  VERY noisy, not a romantic date nite place for sure.  Fun loud atmosphere, lots of spankings, lots of alcohol.  The food, just so-so.
Probably an ok place for a drunken party with friends, not the place for a nice meal.the burger was good, not great but oh the service, i think they forgot all about us.   If you are looking to eat in less than an hour forget it!Way over hyped!  Food was eh and service was mediocre.  Was hoping for something so much better after seeing them on TV.  Boo!REALLY??! 4 STARS?!

I was so excited to try out the buffet at the Bellagio.  Reading all reviews for all the buffets in Vegas this seemed like it was one of the best ones.  My family went to Vegas for Christmas to watch Cirque du Solei and we wanted to get dinner before the show.  And the buffet was conveniently located next to the "O" theater.

It took us about an hour to get in and we stood in line at 3:30pm.  So I can't even imagine how long it would take to get in during normal dinner hours.  Since it was the holidays, it was $45 per person.  With such high prices and reviews I was expecting a bomb ass dinner.  

Maybe I expectations were too high to be realistically met but I thought all the food was average or below average.  I tried various cuts of beef and duck and thought all the meat was towards the dry side.  Also I tried the foie gras and it was not good.  

I know everyone raves about the all you can eat crab legs.  BUT THEYRE COLD!!  When crab meat is cold I don't really like it and the warm butter didn't really improve the taste either.

I was excited to try all the cute desserts but they were all ok but the chocolate mousse was pretty good.

Even if the buffet was $30, I wouldn't think it was nearly worth it and I don't think I'll eat here again.Extremely overpriced for what you get. You end up paying nearly $50 if you get bottomless mimosas. That really isn't as great as it sounds. I'm sure their dinner is better. But their lunch selection is not all that special. Maybe it's because they serve a lot of breakfast foods, and I'm not a huge fan of those types of food. Their banana hazelnut toast was interesting and fresh, but a huge portion to say the least. Their omelets were fresh and made to serve so you can customize it in which ever way you'd like. I'd say my favorite entree there would be the bleu cheese pasta. But that was about it. Their soups were boring, salmon was dry, and chicken skewers looked cool but were really just cold and tough. I just felt like it was a dressed up hometown buffet.. nothing special. I probably could've done more with that $50 out on the floor of the casino because I didn't have much of an appetite for their food.All the stunts look old, and seems like ive seen most of them on TV before.... Couple of stunts were completely repetitive, and the same thing repeats again and again ... and again.... and ofcourse how can I forget , again !! (especially in the stunts where guys on the bars hang from the top)

Stage doesnt do much except go up and down, and the screen in the background, and the blown up Snail/Mascot in the end look worn out and really aged. 

It is not visually stunning anymore as most of the stunts can be seen on Talent shows over the world (especially the one with 2 guys performing acrobatics on each other). 

All in all, not worth the money. All my friends who had seen Ka, Le Reve and "O" were completely disappointed.Okay, the girls are hot, but that's pretty much all Tao has going for them.

Holy sweaty bodies, Batman, I can't freakin' move in this joint.  Here's a tip: wanna head over to the bar?  Give yourself a good 10 minutes cuz that's how long it's going to take you to trek them 30 feet.  Yea, I get it, it's a club, it's crowded, and I don't mind grinding up on hot girls while I try to bring back circulation into my legs, but when Bruno over here starts rubbing his ass in my stomach we have a serious problem.

Unless you're getting a bottle, I'd try to avoid this place.

ps- Tao's food is decent though!I'm thinking the Palms club scene isn't what it used to be.  Ghost Bar was kind of tragic.  1/2 empty, tiny and depressing.  Maybe it was because it was Sunday, but still...

+1 star for the absolutely amazing view!We've seen all the Vegas Cirque shows... This was a disappointment.  The "star" of the show was the stage.  Otherwise, it was completely forgettable.There's no will call.  Even if you buy tickets online, you still have to wait in the same line with people who are trying to purchase tickets.

There's no doubt that this is a high dollar production.  The ticket price starts from $69.  Had I paid that amount, I would consider that well deserved.  But I paid close to $160 per ticket, and I didn't think that the show justified that amount.

The audience was moving about the theater throughout the entire show.  The show also allows people to roll in late.  I found that very distracting.

The show is artistic, but some parts were boring.  The story didn't flow well.  This is my first Cirque Du Soleil.  I would never go to one again.The show is five-stars up until the end. Then, due to the death of a performer in a previous show, they replaced the final battle scene with a CGI video. This completely disrupts the momentum and flow of the performance. It's so baffling that it will compromise all of the previous acts in the show and you will not be able to think about anything else, unfortunately.

They could have reworked the final battle scene to make it safer but they did the worst thing possible and put a video up on a screen, which is insulting and leaves the audience dumbfounded with no going back. It's very unfortunate because this used to be a great show. I recommend O and Mystere instead.Even if you had the "Buffet of Buffets" pass, I'd recommend checking out other places before here. For the regular price, I do not recommend coming here. I'd rather eat one nicer dish at a restaurant. 

All I ate here were some fruits and the rosemary chicken. Yes it was good but for $35? Hell no. And yes, you are in Las Vegas so there is a higher standard for buffets.  So, if you've ate there and didn't think it was bad, you are correct. It is not bad at all. But, as a Las Vegas buffet, it sucked. Very disappointing, since I love the Caesars Palace. You'd think their buffet would be as grand as their hotel.I give the food 4 stars, and the service 1 star.
I've been here twice months apart, most recently yesterday. The first time I ate here was this past summer, on a not so busy Sunday late afternoon. We were seated quickly but took 1.5 hours for our food to come! When asked what the delay was, management actually came out, apologized and said my friend's sandwich had to be remade because it was dropped on the ground. Fine. 
As for yesterday, we also came for brunch and were a group of 6, we were seated right away because it wasn't so busy. Great because we were starving. Our waitress took 30 minutes to come and introduce herself, and disappeared for a long while-- we had to ask other staff if we could please put in our order (we were starving). She finally took our order, but later on came out to tell us she would be leaving and we would have another server. After 1 hour of waiting for our food to come (and not seeing our new waitress since the switch) we noticed that we were never even given the complimentary bread that all the other tables received. We asked another server (not ours, she was still missing) if we could have bread and by that time our server was coming out with our orders, which were ALL COLD.
The food is great at this place-- I've had the fried chicken strips and waffles, and the corned beef hash-- I hate to give it a poor review, since the chefs and cooks seem to have it on point! But man is the service bad.The decor was too dark and too grim, not a fan. However the mac and cheese side tasted alright. I order bbq ribs as an entree. It was well done and tender but the sauce left something to be desired. The sweet potato fries were tasty! For the high price, I would *not* bother.Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.

I ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.

Overall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.A couple days ago, I came here for an early lunch with Donald. We had a coupon for $6.99 lunch that was good for up to four people. They open at 11am Mon-Sat and it was only 11:15am when we got inside. When we started going down the salad bar, I couldn't help but notice that everything looked like it was just uncovered from the night before. A lot of the salad was limp and majority of the toppings were almost empty. Considering they just opened 15 minutes before, it shouldn't have looked like that at all. In fact, one would think we would be getting the best of everything because it should all be newly stocked. That just wasn't the case here...

We looked at the menu online beforehand to make sure they had soups that we would like. The main reason why I wanted to go was for the Cream of Broccoli and Sweet Tomato Onion, so after eating some salad I went to load up on soup. I saw French Onion, chili, Cream of Broccoli, Turkey Noodle, Dill Potato, and Split pea. What was missing? The Sweet Tomato Onion!! Apparently they just don't follow their menu that's posted online because the Tomato Onion and Chicken Noodle were missing, but they had Dill Potato and French Onion, which weren't even on their online menu.

The only thing I really liked about my experience here the other day was that it was easy to find booth seating right next to the soup/pasta section because it was very early on a weekday, but that's not enough of a bonus to add another star.Had high hopes for this place but was very disappointed.

Went with a friend and sat at the bar (my preferred location in most restaurants).  Did get good wine bottle recommendation.  Bartender recommended we each get a pizza as one was too small.  My friend is a social butterfly and makes friends with everyone else at the bar (fortunately) and we kinda decide we'll share each other's pizzas.  We each order a pizza.  Here's where things start going badly.
1. The pizzas are large enough to share between 2.
2. My friend's pizza (white pizza with some stuff and truffle oil).  WAY too much truffle oil as we can't taste anything else.
3. My pizza doesn't arrive.  A few minutes later I ask the bartender where my pizza is.  "Should be out any minute"
4. 10 minutes later - "Should be out any minute"
5. 15 minutes later - "Uh, we are making it now" - Note that all of these were at my request for an update, not proactive by the bartender.

Since we shared pizza amongst the bar, I don't want it anymore.  I tell the bartender to stop the order.  "uh, ok, we won't charge you for it".  No kidding!!

The other pizza's were good but not great.  I did have some spaghetti from one of the other bar mates and that was better than the pizza.

Maybe sitting at the bar was a mistake.  I wouldn't go back anyway.I got their biggest suite available because we had a large group that came up with us. It is called the Derby Suite and we got it for about $350 a night. It was well over 2000sq ft. I'm sure in the 60's, 70's this place had some big name people staying within their doors but that was a long time ago. Other than the size this place was a dump...Everything was ran into the ground and the place looked dirty even after they got done cleaning it. If you aren't trying to impress the ladies then this place will be fine. 

Pros:
-Price
-Ok gambling hall

Cons:
-Everything elseOk, so I stayed here for a convention...if they pick this hotel again as a host hotel, I'll pass.
A ten dollar resort fee is tacked on each night to your room fee.  You would expect, and rightfully so, that a resort would include a pool-closed, a fitness room-only 3 of 6 machines worked, filthy with dirty towels strewn all over, and a non-smelly room.  Not sure what are resort fee included, but if a fitness room that reeks of smoke is the Plaza's idea of a resort, they need to reassess!
Also, as other reviews have noted, the blankets are paper thin, no fridge, no microwave, vending machines next to empty and on and on and on...
Why 2 stars?  The Saturday night band was great and the garlic knots at the pizza place were great!
I keep reading, "what do you expect for $36/night?? Well first, make that $46/night with the infamous resort fee. Also, it costs nothing to pick up dirty towels in the gym, fill the vending machines and give the carpets in the hallways a sweep.  Spend that resort fee to fix the gym and pool and this may have been a 3 star review..Our Brunch Was very disappointing. . Fish wasn't cooked, bread was rubbery, prime rib had no flavor. Sushi was tasteless, mexican rice overcooked. Desserts were cheap, gelato not good. Overpriced as far as quality. The place was very nice. Great decor. I had the best seat in the house.The restaurant is good for people watching as it's open and next to the poker room at bellagio. I've also seen a few famous poker players eat here. It's cute and trendy, and the food is pretty good although it's tiny portions and expensive. i like the lobster tacos, and kobe beef sliders. i definitely wont eat here if I'm super hungry though.Very disappointing experience. The service was great,but the food was not the quality we expected. I orderded a Ceaser Salad that was a joke. My husband orderded a lettuce wedge salad that had a dressing that was extremely spicy hot and he normally likes spicy food. There was no indication on the menu that it would be spicy. Also we had steak tartare that was also too spicy. My main dish was chicken that was floating in a butter sauce that was also spicy. The sauce on the broccoli was poor.8/29/13
First night in Vegas, my brother in- law wanted me to try this restaurant the place itself is a little dark to the point they had to use a flashlight to look at my  steak.(which we will get to) So lets get right to the steaks. I ordered the bone in rib eye, which is one of my favorites. i ordered mine medium rare. The first steak was well done. The manager was standing behind me watching me cut it several times and finally asked is something was wrong, so i told him it was overcooked and he brought me out a new steak. Great I thought, then the second one was raw that's where the flashlight came and he looked at it. He brought it back for a refire and guess what this time it was microwaved. A microwave steak for $58 and with a name like prime I could buy a better steak in a grocery store.In between all the steaks I had to ask for another drink which the waiter never brought till I was done eating. I sent it back cause it was sitting there so long there wasn't any ice left in it. the manager took my microwave steak off the bill big deal it still cost me $300, what a waste when there so many good restaurants in VegasThe atmosphere is alright, and the food is good. Nothing special. But the service is exceptionally terrible. I stopped "giving it another try" because I just couldn't take it anymore. It amazes me that a place can consistently have bad service in Las Vegas. No thank you.Okay so to start with I am not a fan of buffets. Just something about touching spoons and surfaces that tons of other people have touched. I mean you cant verify that every guest has washed their hands or not so Id rather not take any chances. I do enjoy pre-plated options like Wicked Spoon though this buffet does not do this. 

So slapping on the old feedbag I was pretty blown away but the sheer quantity and variety of the stations. Chinese, Mexican, American, Seafood, etc.. was crazy how much food there was. While I could go through all the items I tried like the tough and chewy prime rib and the off tasting salsas Id rather just say that this buffet is right on par with say a cruise ship buffet. The quality is only alright but for the price point of $30 I expected higher since the Wicked Spoon is high quality and only charges a few bucks more. 

If you're expecting to be wowed just lower your expectations and Im sure you'll be fine. My expectation of anyone visiting a buffet, please wash your hands first.Went here once again with my entire family on Monday because it was my grandmother's birthday, and let me tell you.. The Carnival buffet is declining as far as food quality/quantity go :(

The local discount is no longer 50% off. It's now 25%, and that includes your Total Rewards Card. Not only is it pricier for locals, but their food is a bit of a disappointment. They still have delicious crab legs that you can get warm or cold (I prefer cold if you ask me), and the delicious cocktail shrimp which they now have in Cajun. The cajun shrimp honestly tastes like they just sprinkled it the powder it on it and served it as is. When it came to dessert time, they didn't even have much of a selection compared to the last other times we were here. HUGE disappointment if you ask me :(

Their service is the only reason why I gave them two stars. There were ten people in our table, yet our server was on top of his game! He took away our food and refilled our drinks, and the best part was that we didn't even have to ask him twice or we didn't even have to flag him down to ask for refills. It's like he read our minds and got what we needed.

With that said, Carnival Buffet had better service but everything else is on the decline. I would much rather pay a visit to the Village Seafood Buffet at the other side of the casino!Came in for Sunday brunch. Smallest Bloody Mary I've seen in my life. Seriously. Food was pretty tasty. Both the huevos rancheros and the Benedict were cooked well but not seasoned adequately. Odd manager walking through the dining room caused some raised eyebrows. Service was just ok. Not the best experience for the hype there's a lot of better brunch spots in the area.This is a review for breakfast at Kahunaville.

My parents and I ate at three places in Treasure Island when we stayed there last week. All were not very good, and this place is no exception.

The service at Kahunaville was not great. We waited a long time to order and a long time for our food. Breakfast is so simple. It's ridiculous that it would take such an inordinate amount of time to get scrambled eggs. 

My parents had already ordered and were eating by the time I arrived at the restaurant, so I had some of their food before I ordered. The scrambled eggs, hash browns, and bacon I tried were no better than what you get at Denny's. It is worth noting that the portions are very large at Kahunaville. My parents shared a meal, and it was plenty of food.

I decided to try the fruit platter. It was definitely an experience. My fruit platter had a whole banana, 1/4 of a pineapple, 5 strawberries, lots of honeydew melon and cantaloupe, grapes, orange slices, more pineapple, and a yogurt dipping sauce. All of the fruit was ripe and tasty. However, there was an unexpected and unpleasant surprise in the dish. They drizzled a liberal amount of some liqueur over the fruit. Why??? The fruit was fine on its own. Who wants to taste alcohol when it's not in an amount appreciable enough to get you buzzed? I feel like they should have at least mentioned that on the menu. 

I'm not sure how this place is for other meals, but I'm not inclined to give it another chance.Well let's start by saying - Service was good.  No complaints there.  So this is not one of those bitter posts you see.  The reason I give 2-stars is b/c of the service otherwise I would drop it lower.
Now - let's get to the skinny.  
THE FOOD - It honestly wasn't all that great.  We had a few different plates b/c it's a Tapas/Small plate style restaurant.One thing that irritates me is when restaurants over charge for breakfast. Seriously- what does a few eggs, 3 strips of bacon, a few silver dollar pancakes and a handful of potatoes cost to make? I guarantee you it is not the $16.00 that Studio Cafe charges for this standard breakfast. 

If I am paying $16.00 for breakfast, it better be really good and there needs to be leftovers. Bottom line, the scrambled eggs were slightly underdone and luke warm at best. The bacon was on par with what you would find at your local Denny's, and the potatoes were a pile of garbage. 

The service was spotty at best. After our waitress took our order, I didn't see her again till she dropped off the bill. Someone else dropped off our food, and no one refilled our drinks. There are plenty of better options off the strip....much cheaper. 

I won't be coming back anytime soon.Ok, I found this place on yelp & some of the other reviews said that the museum presented a balanced viewpoint. No, it doesn't. The museum makes absolutely no mention of the indigenous inhabitants of the Marshall Islands and what has happened to them as a result of nuclear testing there. In fact, the museum specifically states that the testing in the Marshall Islands occurred there as it was far from any population centers. 

This makes zero sense, as the US government has even acknowledged this tragedy & offered monetary damages for it. Google Marshall Islands Jellyfish Babies. 

On the positive side, the exhibit in the side gallery right now, is full of awesome soviet propaganda posters.We use to go to this location before the name change and it was excellent, but now I have to agree with the review below, the meat is over cooked and while the salad bar has great selection, it just doesn't taste good.Went to this place for lunch with family today.  Wasn't impressed and after going to the one on 83rd and Bell which was a much better experience.  Arrived and was seated by host.  Drinks brought out quickly, ordered the mussels in rusted garlic sauce, Cesar salad, rigatoni alla diavolo, my wife ordered the mussels in alfredo sauce.  I ordered a childs pizza for my son.  Had to ask for bread which is usually not requested in Italian restaurants.  Server Mary brought bread when requested but with no butter, brought salad and never offered Parmesan cheese.  Food came out and compared to the 83rd Ave location it was bland and my son's pizza looked like they had someone training for the first day.  The thing wasn't even round.  Nonetheless I will be returning to that location.  The place was stuffy too.Note: This review regards the Restaurant Week 2011 Menu 

Great hopes, severe disappointment.  Yep, that pretty much sums up my experience at Sensi.

Upon entering Sensi we seated next to a large party of eight and another table that included an infant.  Dozens of empty tables but they plopped us down in that spot.

Tangent: Now, I don't hate small children, I really don't, but I hate being near them in upscale restaurants.  I go to upscale restaurants so I don't have to be near them and hear them scream.  Yes, kids are adorable and are the future, blah, blah, blah, but I am not paying $50 pp to listen to a stranger's child cry.  

Okay, so, yes, the child screamed/yelled/stared at me through the meal and the large party of eight, who apparently never learned the concept of "inside voices," aurally overwhelmed the restaurant's other diners.  This is not entirely the restaurant's fault, however, but they could have handled the situation better.  The noise pretty much ruined the meal.

The food was pretty disappointing too.  My restaurant week menu included the steamed Chinese buns, the grass-fed skirt steak, and the chocolate temptation.

The Chinese steamed buns may have been the worst thing I've eaten in awhile.  The dried-shrimp filling, which was incredibly salty, combined with the unbearably sweet hoisin vinagarette sauce, was almost unpalatable.  DO NOT WANT.

The skirt steak was fine but it was a rather small portion.  It included expertly-made brussel sprouts and spaghetti squash.  I hate brussel sprouts but I loved these!  This dish saved the experience from being an epic disaster.

The chocolate temptation was basically a ferrero rocher candy bar topped with insanely burnt-tasting caramel ice cream.  It was okay, but also kind of gross (the ice cream overwhelmed the entire dish).

We had very little interaction with our waiter but he seemed nice enough.  Not particularly helpful or attentive, however.  I went on a Wednesday specifically so I would get better service (less busy = attentive service, right?), but that wasn't the case here.

Sad to say, it gets 1.5 stars.  The only bright spots were the skirt steak and awesome naan bread basket (free with meal).  Blargh.A few friends and I went to AZ during spring training and I knew one of the places we had to go was Big Bang.  I emailed a few weeks before to get on the VIP list and we were all set.  I used to visit Tempe often when my sister went to ASU and we went here a few times and always had a great time.

We went out to dinner at a place across the street and had a few drinks.  After dinner we headed over to BIg Bang and retrieved our wristbands. My boyfriend and a friend walked across the street to buy some cigarettes so the rest of us headed in and got our first round of drinks and a table.  When my boyfriend and friend came back the bouncer at the door would not let him enter because he said he was too drunk. WHAT?!?!?  

I asked to speak with the manager and she seemed to want to help. She spoke with the bouncer first before even speaking with my boyfriend and I to assess the situation.  When I approached her she stated that she was taking the bouncers side and would not let my boyfriend in. Again, without even talking to us or anything. It was crazy!  I kind of had the feeling that the bouncer had it out for us.  It was all so strange.These guys are waayyyy slow!  The prices are.... reasonable I guess?  But in brevity, my experiences below:

Meat- Middle of the road quality, but pricing can be a bit extreme.  Caution with meat that is priced "special" as it can be as old as I am from time to time.  The butchers are incredibly friendly and helpful though.  Great Carne Asada.

Produce- I haven't had too many experiences with bad produce, but prices are a bit ridiculous.  They have a decent variety, but sometimes stocking levels are horribly low.

Grocery- The Just For You is about the only way they are consistently budget friendly.  They tend to pull the age old trick of knocking down the most expensive brand a few cents when generics or lesser brands are as much as half of the price.

Cleanliness- Biggest knock.  At any given time you can find half of their staff sitting on the tables out front smoking, meanwhile lines are extremely long.  GO UNION!!  I shop at Glaziers primarily for this reason.I will admit Im a Phantom of the Opera fan. Having seen it at the Orpheum in SF my bars were set high already. Our party did love the special effects and the theater. The  chandelier  is AMAZING!!! The costumes are amazing as well.
One major drawback is the lack of dialogue.
 I thought the collaboration with Webber would help add a more fluid and concise explanation between each act segue. For a person who has never seen the show there are moments where you feel lost. One being in the begining where the set goes back in time and another beinf where Christine goes to her fathers grave.
In all I liked it, but I did not LOVE it. I would gladly sit through the 2.5 hours for a full story, Im just not so sure the Vegas crowd is.Seriously? People giving this place 5 stars? I have lived in Southern CA and now in El Paso, TX. I've tried some of the best mexican food, but this place was just ok. I've eaten "New Mexico" food in New Mexico and it's tasted better than this place. The food was a bit greasy. Granted, we ordered take-out from this place so maybe the food could have been better if we ate it in the very tiny restaurant that doesn't even have a sign on the outside. It's amazing how people even find this place!Really a downgrade from the original Pei Wei diner.  The food menu was changed way too much and the kitchen is much less flexible on what they are willing to do. Unfortunately I think everyone has caught on since the lunch hour seems to be pretty empty.. Unlike before when you had to wait forever to order AND get a seat.  Hopefully they'll change it back..Right now this club will get two stars. Mainly because of the 10.50 beers. Some of the girls were decent, but there is too much of a hustle going on. Could get a higher rating if they have a decent steak at a reasonable price.Not my favorite place to shop.  The store is huge and very disorganized.  I don't like that they don't sell meats here.  They do sell seafood but no meats.  I like to do all my shopping in one store so I was disappointed that I had to stop at another store.  The only plus for this store is that sell my favorite brand of kimchee...halms. Other than that I don't think I will shop here and will go to 99 ranchI guess for what you pay, the portions are reasonable. Bf would say this is the Claim Jumper of breakfast joints. Since the items are mediocre, just make them bigger and upcharge. 

I got the Smoked Salmon Hash (~$14?) with a side of bacon (~$3) and shared it with bf. We comfortably finished it. 

The salmon was just meh. I always think salmon is over-cooked. Its like the canned stuff. When am I gonna learn my lesson and just stop ordering salmon at diners? 

I didn't think there was anything special about this place. Its just basic breakfast foods, in larger portions. Very American. 

I was looking at their dinner menu ... looks better than breakfast. 

* off the strip, non-casinoThe was tasty which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars.  Although it was tasty it was also very greasy.

Be warned the world famous Bloody Mary's are horrible.  When we were able to actually find our waitress she told us yea they are very spicy like that and left.  When we finally got a hold of her 5 minutes later we asked if we could order something else because the amount of horseradish in there made it undrinkable.  She said she'll bring us some more tomato juice which never happened.

Service here was non exsistant.  Our waitress introduced herself at the beginning and took off for 20 minutes.  When we finally saw her again she was on the phone and gave us the "give me a minute finger".The food here is great and all, but I need healthy options for when I'm dieting, and this place has NONE.
Everything they have is breaded, fried, or dripping with saturated fat!
It's truly built for fatasses, and people ignorant of their organ's inability to regenerate, but I have heard nothing but ravings from fans, so I thought I'd give it a go.

Ordered the smallest thing: 3 pcs, fries, texas toast, with soda. I was completely stuffed full of carbs by the time I finished. I even won a free chicken strip coupon...and gave it to my sister, who is one of the raving fans.

BFG's is far more superior...bur what do I expect? Cane's a chain.
Cane's: give me more options and I'll return, I'm a gemini for christ's sake.

I'm not saying don't try it-variety is the spice of life, and a lot of people LOVE this place like a brother, I'm just not one of them.It is, what it is: a very commercial, country bar. Highlights were the fried bologna sandwich. Lowlights were: most everything else. In fairness: I had no business being here.Last night my friends and I  were boozehounds in downtown Scottsdale. This morning we woke up with a headache and a craving for food from our native land: Philadelphia.  So of course we ordered from the Philadelphia Sandwich Company.

After about an hour of waiting for our food we called and checked to see the delivery status. Apparently they could not find our apartment and went back to the restaurant. No call back to check,  nothing. What if WE didn't call? Would we have gotten our food? Who knows.

With that said, once they actually delivered, the food was decent.

I may try you again Philadelphia Sandwich company! Just don't ally oop the scoop with our delivery !!Cheese steak = 5 stars
Service = 2 stars
Waiting time = 0 stars

We really want to love this place, but they're making it very hard for us to do so. We loved it when it was at the smaller location on Scottsdale road, but it's gone way downhill since moving to the current location.

We have been there several times in 2013. Each time the wait was ridiculously long. How long can it take to grill a couple of cheese steaks!? Often there was nobody anywhere near the register to take our order. Every once in a while a guy would come out from the back to tell people that their order was coming out soon. The problem is that there would be several people waiting, and not very many people actually eating. It seems like the guy working the register is also cooking, or helping the cook. That's crazy.

We've taken friends on a few occasions and it's been the same story. I keep thinking that it was just a bad day, so we try again a while later. We don't even come when it's very busy, but it's always the same long wait. We've been late to movies because of the unreasonably long wait for our food.

Don't get me wrong. We love the cheese steaks once we finally get them, but we don't know if that's enough to make up for the bad service and looooooooong wait.

My wife vows to never return. I'm close to agreeing, but I still hold out hope that they'll get their act together.

A guy can always hope.We ordered shrimp dumpling soup and requested 2 bowls, but our server did not think it would be enough for us so we cancelled that order and requested the pan fried noodles with chicken.  We ended up receiving both.  The soup had a curious flavor and the noodle dish was pretty mundane.$24.99 for brunch.   Food was soso, I expect much better from Mandalay Bay...For a vegas this place was eh! The place looked nice but the Dj sucked! We waited and a new Dj started spinning around midnight to 1am so we had hope but he sucked too! If you want a vegas experience, go somehwere else!I really wanted to love this place. But I didn't. I went at the end of the day and got a couple of baked goods. Maybe its because it was end of day and stuff just wasn't fresh. But it also wasn't flavorful. And it was very pricey.

 I went back a second time, because like I said, I really wanted to love it. But again, I did not. This time I ordered a pasta lunch dish that sounded yums. It was ok, but very much on the bland side. For the price I paid, I could have made bland food at home. I go out because I am not great at putting meals together, though given how much I eat out I know how to appreciate a well prepared meal. It may have been organic, but it just wasn't good. I am not going to spend so much money on them again. 

Side note, their pastries cost way too much. Maybe on the Strip you can charge that much - but for tasteless pastries, no way.

I did dig the decor, and the service was fine.Gross is the first word that comes to mind.  The ladies room was covered in piss and toilet tissue. If that's not indication enough of how classy that place is maybe the soft porn or rude crowd that will push u to get a mini beer for a nickle would be. Really weird vibe there too. I'll pass and go next door and pay the 4 extra dollars for a full sized beer that I don't have to wait in line for.Sigh. I guess it's inevitable. I have to write a Beauty Bar review.  Welp...here goes.

I'd just like to start out by saying I really have to give the BB kudos - they and the Griffin really stuck out their necks (and pocketbooks) to forge ahead solo on Fremont East before it became established as the hipster haven it is becoming / has become. For that alone, they earn my respect. A friend and I stopped in early one evening when they first opened - I remember a well stocked bar and foxy tattooed bartenders that were really nice to boot!

Since then I've seen some terrific bands there over the years both inside and outside on the back patio, such as Nashville Pussy (outside in freezing temps), Andre Williams, various punk rock bowling shows, and the amazing Bellrays performed to an audience of five one night stuffed into the space in one of the front window bays. That said, I seem to enjoy this place less and less each and every time I come.

First off - it's TOO FREAKIN' LOUD inside. Whether there's a band playing or a DJ spinning records the sound level in this place borders on painful. There is such a thing as a comfortable music level - even for loud rock and roll in a divey bar. I know, I know...if it's too loud, you're too old - well, maybe I am.

Secondly - BEER IN A CAN (blaaargh). The Beauty Bar used to serve bottled beer (that you would pour into a plastic cup to go out on the patio). I understand the safety concerns and the reasons behind the plastic party cup, but seriously?  Can you not have ONE decent light beer bottled or on tap? Nothing bums me out more than beer in a can. For real. 

I really want to love the BB - and I didn't mind it there for a while - but it seems to get more low budget and lackluster each and every time I go.  This last time we went my friend asked for scotch - and they stared at her quizzically before telling her they don't have scotch. At a bar. Kind of sad, when they have so much possibility to be a stellar venue.Ugh I can't stand this place. The only reason it gets two stars is because I can walk there and it's an okay place to day drink and eat some chips and salsa.  On Cinco de Mayo, they block of the parking lot and fill it with sand and then you have to wait 30 minutes to get in.  And then pay.  

Friday and Saturday nights are lame-o.  Guys have to pay $5.00.  If you're in heels, forget walking in the sand.  The dance floor fills with a bunch of drunks around midnight.  The crowd is definitely not "Scottsdale", but it's something.....more like skater boy meets Affliction meets arm band tattoos.  And that's just the guys.  

I've just spend a few too many nights here either with friends that actually like it or as a last resort so we can stumble home....and haven't had a good time, EVER.We have enjoyed Mastro's Ocean Club many times with excellent service, knowledgeable waiters and amazing food.  Tonight we again had wonderful service and a great staff but the food was very poor. I don't know if they had a new chef or what happened in the kitchen but we had three meals and all of them were poor.   I did write the Ocean Club directly so they are aware of the problem but I believe it will be a while before we return. I hope to hear back from them that it was just something that went wrong in the kitchen tonight.I like whiskey. I showed up before 11 pm, paid the $5 cover for hip-hop night (a Friday) because inside they have $1 well drinks. Honestly, how are you out of whiskey that early in the night.

Needless to say I was forced to drink vodka. I'm not all that friendly when drunk on vodka.

The place is okay to watch games. I've never gotten friendly service, more of a disdained treatment. I'll probably still come here when my friends bring me along. But there are better sports bars in the area.

The only time I can recommend coming here is for New Year's Eve when they have a block party on the street with live music and  with the two bars across the street.this reminds me of the ghetto mall from my home town...very...abandoned.  i came by here in the AM in search of a pair of cheap flip flops for my vacation.  as i walked across the parking lot a creepy car was passing by and slowed down to take a look at me.  first the dude just said hi, started to drive away and then stopped and tried to call me over.  i walked a little faster so i could get inside.  there's a macy's and a dillard's in here, so i wouldn't consider it a complete failure, but you know you're on a downward spiral when there's a Fredricks of Hollywood with a Bling Bling stall right outside. 

they had an old navy though, and god knows old navy makes cheap ass flip flops, so i was set.Definitely wait to come here after 11:30 a.m. If you arrive early like I did at 10:45 a.m. everything they're serving isn't fresh. The first 3-4 dishes we ate were cold and disappointing. But once they start pushing around the fresh dim sum carts, the food is pretty decent. Just keep your expectations low and do not order the Wonton Noodle Soup (it's not worth the $7). I wouldn't eat here again if I could help it, supposedly there are better dim sum places in Vegas.With so many options in Las Vegas, I have to say I was surprisingly underwhelmed with Stripsteak. This statement may seem incorrect, but allow me to explain. In Las Vegas there are so many amazing restaurants that they each need to compete to stay on top, or at the very least - relevant. I didn't feel that Stripsteak was even trying. 

The decor made me feel like I was in a cafeteria. The way the tables were placed and the type of chairs they had looked like a food court in a mall or cafeteria. It wasn't impressive at all. The menu didn't have anything on it that really stood out to me either. It was a standard Steak House menu- which isn't something to complain about, since I love steak, but the steak I had wasn't even that good. - A little background on me- it takes a lot for me to dislike any steak. I love steak. This steak in particular was just BORING. It wasn't cooked Medium Rare- it was more on the medium well side- which is fine too, but when you're paying $50 for a steak it should probably be cooked the way you requested. It also lacked flavor. It was just blah. I never in my life had such an expensive boring meal. 

The upside- the french fries. The different french fries that they bring to each table as opposed to bread are phenomenal- and also the reason for 2 stars as opposed to 1. 

I'm sorry to the Stripsteak fans, but for me Stripsteak is a massive let down.Honestly, would have walked to the food court around the corner, but seeing as how I predicted I'd be at the food court later in the AMs.....I chose to go with the "healthier/better/guiltless" option.

Had the Roasted Turkey. Good. Nothing to rave about. Put me in walking vicinity of Earl's and I'd go there 100%.Got asked for my ID while watching the Ravens @ Broncos game. The security guard was younger than me.I stopped going here for two reasons:

They stopped the Basics class with Mimi Solaire.

Her replacement was less than half as qualified and forced us to listen to his mediocre singing. 

Awful!First time here and ambience is great. Wholesome atmosphere. Has a movie theater, bowling alley and pool. Great customer service...not really! 

Down falls: 
1) Very long hallways. Prepare to walk. 
2) Part of the pool area had a foul smell of sewage. Looks like it was coming from the construction work being done right beside the pool. 
3) Day 2 our card keys would not work. Had to go back several times before they had someone come up with me and try it out and was told "could be the lock that has a problem, will send up an engineer to fix it". Waited for over an hour while the rest of my party was enjoying themselves. Decided to call front desk and they said it may take hours for one available. Took 2 hours before engineer fixed it and AGAIN keys would not work! 

How it got resolved, I had to SACRIFICE my night and stay in the room so that we could have access to the room.  Receptionist that came up to see for herself that card isn't working told us nothing can be done, can't move us either because they fully booked and guy on the walkie talkie which she was talking to said we have to wait until tomorrow. 

To be exact, 9 hours of walking the long hall and going up and down the stairs several times just because of that stupid card keys and door lock. I WASTED a day in this hotel! Wanna waste your money and time stay here.Well, here I go again in Vegas with Mexican Food. This place was recommended by a friend but it might have been go there and drink and I missed that part. As a bar it was happening but the food was unimpressive. I got fajitas and it was tasteless and totally forgettable. I knew I had to review it fast before I forgot the entire experience lol. It looks like as a bar this place might be cool. Its across from the Hard Rock so it seems to fill up. However, it felt like locals in there so I am not sure who is filling it up. I will have to hit it on the way home some night and check it out as a bar not a restaurant.

One thing I found annoying as well, as they charge $1 for chips and salsa?? So I thought wow it must be good, uh.. no.. It was nothing to even recall, in fact I cant remember what it tasted like. So no freebies in this joint.In addition to Cuban food, there is (Latin) dancing on Friday nights. The dance floor is small.Finally located this place, as it is tucked out of the way. Kinda of an interesting look to it inside. as it try's for an Irish pub feel.
Good selection of craft beers posted on a chalk board.I tried a burger and it was soggy and uninspired. Go for the drinks but don't eat.CRAP!! 15 bucks for 2 chocolate milk shakes!!! Vegas baby!! Just another reminder of what city your in. Forget this place. Dennys is up the street..These theme joints are a flippin' rip.. Oh yeah, the shakes?? So-so..Well, it is convenient if you gamble at the Casino, but then you also get the ciggy smoke as the restaurant shares the same space.

Staff was friendly.  

Food was :meh; - some items definitely tasted of the can or mix - disappointed in the crab cakes, but the sides were all good and the veggies were fresh.  Agree with some other reviewers here, the cole slaw is the best of the sides.  Breakfast another day was the French Toast plate, OK but I asked for all bacon and got bacon and sausages... and the coffee was nothing special.  Portion size was ample but not overwhelming, best value when using 1/2 off coupons.Client dinner, in vegas, on expense account - let's do the guys steak night thing.

Smith & Wollensky is obviously a well-known name in the world of steaks, so I was happy to be there

I think this place probably suffered from Vegas-itis too (like other Vegas restaurants I've been to lately).  You take a well-known restaurant from somewhere else or a well-known chef, drop it/he/she in Vegas, don't get it 100% right, and end up with some bastardized version of the original.

Three bottles of Pinot Noir for the table is always a good way to start, so that's what we did.  Appetizers were good, but nothing special.  Your usual mix of caesar salads, iceberg lettuce wedges with bleu cheese and a tomato bisque type soup.

Biggest let down was their signature steak.  I had never been there so I asked the waiter what is the thing they are best known for and he said the "Cajun Spice Rib Eye".  The spice is rubbed in and then left to rest for 24 hours, blah, blah, blah.  I think they also told it that it had a nice personality so it would have high self-esteem.  They don't trim the steak so that the extra fat adds more flavor.  The problem was that every other bite had something that was undigestible because it was either fat or sinew.  I think I would have traded the "flavor" for just being edible.  Last thing about the steak - never tasted the cajun spice (insert Seinfeld voice - "called a cajun steak...but wasn't cooked by a cajun and never tasted the spice...what is the deal with that?).  They must have known it was lacking flavor or something because they put their S&W steak sauce out on the table.  I'll be honest, I've never heard of a big-time steak house offering steak sauce.  I wanted to check if they had A-1 while he was at it.

Highlight was actually dessert.  Coconut Layer Cake was awesome.  We also ordered the chocolate mousse, but they mistakenly brought out their "Gigantic Chocolate Cake" - no joke, that's what it's called on the menu.  This five layer monstrosity is the size of Fat Bastard's head and as tall as two phone books.  We passed it around the table and still had half of it left.  It was super moist, but it all stayed together when you cut it.  Phenomenal with a little coffee or espresso at the end.

Overall, a pretty mediocre steak night (food-wise) with the fellas, but hey, you're in Vegas, so you let it slide.Very nice decor and horrible food. I had duck salad can't even chewed it was so hard and overcooked.  
Calamari salad was ok but calamari was cold.This buffet was not really that good. Me and my buddy went to eat here prior to hitting the town. We get there and it was pretty empty. Maybe about five more guests were eating here. 

The selection was the smallest I have ever seen in Vegas. They tried to have every international flavor there is but it would only be one or two main courses. 

A buffet would not be a buffet without Prime Rib. The Prime Rib here was ehh. It did not seem like the middle pieces had any sort of flavor. It was juicy but not tasty. 

I would not recommend going to this buffet. You can definitely find a better buffet in Vegas than this.My buddy and I ate at B&B yesterday Saturday night, getting there around 9:45 on our last night in Vegas hoping to have extraordinary Italian food.  We each got one of the tasting menus and were overall disappointed. I had a glass of the Morellino di Scansano I Perazzi La Mozza 2007 Toscana and enjoyed this glass and a half pour with a mini decanter very much.  Very smooth, no acid, no tannins, not great fruit, but just enough. 

For starters both tasting menus start off with 3 courses of raviolis.  Its just raviolis after raviolis.  For example, for the Pasta tasting menu, you get a ricotta ravioli in butter sauce, lambs brain ravioli in butter sauce with sage, a green pasta with a light meat sauce, and then another ravioli filled with short ribs. I mean enough with the raviolis. The next course Gnocchi was a real disappointment.  The gnocchi was really super firm, bordering on hard, obviously not hand made, and definitely not light.  and again with a braised oxtail which tasted like beef brisket. The highlight of this meal was the 2 dessert courses.  The Zabaglione with grapefruit was absolutely light, sublime, transcending, magical.  It reminded my friend of some delicious Japanese dessert crapes he had in Seattle with strawberries, whipped cream and Zabaglione in a crape cone.  The final dessert was an Italian Flan with crunchy cocoa nibs which was very good. Overall a C+.  Portions very small.  5-8 ravioli per plate. All the ravioli were hand made.

The Lombardia Veal Tasting Menu was not much better. The first course was a thin deli like slice of cooked veal over a mayonnaise sauce with some capers.  Next was a very creamy Tallegio cheese ravioli which tasted liked warm brie inside ravioli, melt in your mouth good.  The next bone marrow ravioli was not memorable at all. My friend liked the next course best, a pounded thin slice of veal, breaded with like panko and deep fried very crispy and topped with arugula and a lemon wedge.  I liked it, but nothing to write home about.  I've had very good country fried steak which were better and more tender. Next was a very slender piece of medium gorgonzola cheese with some candied fruit, a very small and delicate cheese plate.  The desserts for this tasting menu were awful.  Toasted panttone with apricot jam was a joke.  Cinnamon, honeyed butter toast would have been better. And the fried Italian donuts were dense like dense cake, not light like a good beignet, not worth the calories or effort to eat the whole thing. 

They also raised the price from 100 to $120 on Thursday March 10, 2011 and raised the wine paring from 70 to 75.  They comped my wine because of the confusion, but that was still not enough to erase a disappointing Italian meal.  All my buddy and I could do was to recall better meals we had in our lives.  

I can't speak for the rest of the menu.  if this was their best foot forward, then I would spend my money elsewhere.Great food - great wine suggested by the sommelier.   Nice, casual atmosphere.   Why only two stars?  The music.  Loud, heavy metal music.  Asked the waiter what could be done - he checked and said nothing - it was from Mario Batali's iPod playlist.   I wasn't looking for something like Frank Sinatra - but didn't want head banging music either.  Brought it up to the manager - same response.B&B Ristorante was a bit of a disappointment. 
I have been to Chef Balali's Osteria Mozza on Melrose in Los Angeles a few times, so I thought I would try B&B on a recent trip to Las Vegas. Bad idea. Let me tell you... B&B isn't near to the same class as Osteria Mozza. 

The ambiance was nice. Comfortable. Had a familiar feel.

The service was... Lacking. I guess the question should be, was there service? Minimal. 

Homemade Orecchiette with spicy lamb sausage and rapini was fair, not what I would have expected from a Batali and Bastianich restaurant.
Bone Marrow Ravioli with osso bucco ragu was a little better... But still nowhere near mind blowing.
Whole Grilled Branzino with herb and fennel salad was HORRIBLE. The fish did not taste fresh and was a compete waste. Just plain bad.
Veal Chop with pancetta, spinach, and torpedo onions was actually the best item I tried during this visit. It it was just okay. Actually it saved them from a one star rating.

Usually, If I have a bad experience at a restaurant, I will give them a second chance. But this wasn't a minor issue, or one item that wasn't good. It was everything. From the moment I walked in the door. To leaving and heading back to Table 10 to eat a good meal.
I tried it once, but don't think I will again.Plain and simple, this food was not great. Had a Groupon here for lunch. I think the only reason people go here is because it's in the mall at Planet Hollywood. Otherwise, if you have a car you should venture out to the restaurants at Rio or find a Texas de Brazil, or In-N-Out. any of those options would be better than here! This place has a very scant meat selection.

To start, we had to wait 15 minutes to get a table in the near-empty dining room. The gauchos who serve the meat were rude and instead of asking us to move our plates, they put their plates down and shoved ours around with the plate. They also mumbled and half the time I wasn't sure what exactly I was eating. And if you get the surf and turf option, they just plop all the seafood from the spear down on to your plate. And the shrimp is still in the shell, so you get to peel it.

The hostesses were very nice, which was one of the only redeeming things. The other was the cheese bread rolls--always tasty.Out of dozens of trips to Las Vegas, this hotel has the worst service!

I must first start out by writing I only chose to stay at Caesars because I was offered a complimentary stay and a $300 dining credit. When I arrived, I received a call in my room telling my which restaurants I could choose (so I was aware that the hotel knew the restaurant choices). The following night I visited the concierge so I could hear the list again since I didn't have a pen when the call was received the night prior. A restaurant was recommended to me as was instructions on how to claim the dining credit (since it was my first time using a credit). Unfortunately, the concierge was incorrect and that restaurant wasn't covered by the voucher. More unfortunate was the price of the bill. I had to pay $380 for a dinner at a restaurant that I didn't want to eat at, but was presumed to be free (for the first $300 anyway).

I understand the concierge made a mistake with the restaurant, but the hotel front desk and the concierge would not honor the mistake or even credit me for a future voucher. I'm confused that as a marketing tool, Caesars offered me a dining credit to entice me to stay at their hotel in the future but would rather lose thousands in opportunity costs for retaining me as a future loyal customer than honor a $300 mistake. Bottom line: I trusted their concierge, was extremely let down, and will never stay at Caesars again. There are plenty of great hotels in Las Vegas that understand the importance of loyal service and how it is cheaper for a hotel to retain customers than find new ones, and I'll be loyal to the first hotel that can demonstrate that they value my business. P.S. I spend thousands on gambling and entertainment every time I visit. It's not about the $300, it's about the service.

Pretty hotel though..Food was ok but the service was slow. Some servers ran around with their heads cut off while others just stood around.Disappointing. While the Warhol exhibit is interesting, it is an extremely small display for the price. We'd heard about the Gallery for many years, and it didn't live up to the hype. 

I'd recommend the Mob Exhibit at the Tropicana; much better value and highly recommended.The thing I liked most about this place was the choice of beers.  Other than that it was nothing special.  My boyfriend and I shared a mushroom and sausage pizza and each of us got a side salad as well.  The salad tasted like the ones that you buy in the pre-mixed bags, flavorless and too wet.  The pizza was very comparable to Pizza Hut.  Its a shame they compare it to Chicago style deep dish pizza because it doesnt even come close to that!!
I liked the atmosphere and size of the restaurant.  The service was pretty bad.  We called while in the parking lot because it looked really busy but the hostess tells us theres no wait for 2 people.  So we walk in and she says it'll be about 5 minutes.  We could clearly see theres several open tables but whatever.  We stand there and 5 minutes later she decides to tell us "oh, you can just go seat yourself over there"  Ummm okay.  Our server was very nice but I could tell he had more tables then he could handle because after he took our order we didnt see him again for 20 minutes.  We finished our beer and never got asked if we wanted another.  My glass of water remained empty for about 20 minutes.  If he was a bit more attentive I would've enjoyed my experience a lot more.  Medium pizza, 2 side salads, one pint of beer, and the sampler of 4 beers ($6.00) was $40.  All in all, it was nothing special. It tasted like Pizza Hut on a good night but tripple the price!!Friendly staff, Chx fried 2 hard.I call this place Ghetto Mart. It smells like rancid grease and salmonella. But there have a been a few times (a few and only a few) where I needed laundry soap, or syrup or something. I would never buy produce here for any reason. Prices are expensive too. 

Tempe is in desperate need of a grocery store. (Fresh and Easy, are you listening!) Ghetto Mart, I mean Rollins Market, is not the answer. You're better off making the trip a few miles south to a real grocery store.I was a patient for years, but in the last year and a half, service has fallen off greatly.  The office staff is simply too busy to get to callers promptly and if you leave a message, don't hold your breath on being called back.  A couple years ago there was a PA Mimi who was great, but she has left the practice. There was another doctor working with this practice too, but she is also gone, leaving just Dr Hunt.  In my experience as a fairly routine patient, Dr Hunt is knowledgeable enough, but leaves you feeling pretty unimportant as a patient.  Its crazy long wait times in the office and on the phone.  MAs and office staff are friendly, but its not enough to make up for the feeling of being just another patient run through the office, instead of a person who is a patient with needs.I had high hopes for this one, considering all the great reviews... too high of hopes.

I consider myself a Mexican food addict. If there were a Mexican Food Anonymous, I'd absolutely need to join.

Like a few of the previous Yelpers, I ordered the #8 combination, which was a chile relleno, beef taco, and enchilada with rice and beans.
-The beef taco was crisp, yes, but there was the tiniest little shred of beef in it. Might as well have been a fried shell. I took one bite that had meat. The rest was empty.
-The chile relleno was extremely greasy. I don't know if their oil was not hot enough to fry or what, but the batter on the outside of the rellano seemed to be more of an oil sponge than anything. Took one bite and pushed the rest aside.
-The enchilada, generally my least favorite of mexican fare, was actually pretty good. Really plain, but the sauce was the lifesaver on this one. I actually ate the whole enchilada.
-Beans were runny and flavorless. No thanks
-Rice was fluffy, but much like it's frijole counterpart, had no flavor. No thanks again.

All this for 10 bucks (granted that's not a lot of money... but it kind of is considering all I got out of it was basically a bite of taco and a cheese enchilada).

At least the people who worked there were nice.

I won't be back. Sorry.This place changed owners a couple of years ago. I went a couple of times after the owner change. The decor changed a little. Service was friendly but honestly everything was not nearly as good. I was pretty disappointed. Rice was too warm, rolls were falling apart & not the same, sashimi was not that good. I never came back. Oh well, it was great while it lasted.Yelp, I'm sorry. 

I should've checked with you first before walking in here.

Clothes were cute but WAY overpriced, and the service was all over the place.

I don't usually yelp about clothing stores, but my experience was so interesting...

My friend and I just walked in to kill some time and basically play dress up.  At first the staff was OVERLY helpful (in a good way) and brought out shoes and accessories to match what we were trying on.  

We were having a good time... until the close.

Because we were actually having a good time, my friend decided to buy a pricey dress and I was actually going to buy her accessories for her as a gift, since I was in the spirit, but then the service from this point went south so fast it made my head spin. 

They offered a 10% discount with email signup, but then refused to give it on the spot and said we had to wait for the coupon in the mail.  
So my friend was like, then I'll just come back tomorrow with the coupon. 

That's when it went from friendly to icy.

My friend went back and forth with them for awhile, and I just completely lost interest in buying anything from them.

So weird!  They put so much energy into the sale and then just completely killed the mood at the last moment!

I had hoped it was just an off day or something, but I guess fellow yelpers feel kind of the same.

And, no, my friend is not going back for the dress.Sunday afternoon visit. 

The entire place seemed "hungover." The tables were a mess, all random squished together. The servers (if there were 3) were slow and seemed to be running on empty. There was 1 bar tender inside and he was exceptionally slow. 

When we asked about the burgers(fresh or frozen etc) she said "Nothing here is fresh." Welll she was not kidding. The chicken wings went uneaten, the burger was gross, the carrot had frost on it still. The tortilla chips were stale. The fries {all 12} were blah. 

The drinks were all sub par for a bar. The only one that liked it was the beer drinker. 
There was zero music or anything fun going on. 

Bathroom was a mess too.  

I see this being a fun place on a nice Saturday night but other then that....MEHOhh I wish there was a different hardware store in Maricopa.  The most annoying part of this Ace Hardware is how they ask you every 2 minutes if you need help.  Annoying if you have already told several of them "NO", and in most cases the same person several time.   Most people either know what they are looking for, or have the common sense to ask.  If im not in a rush ill drive into town as opposed to go here.  Most items are overpriced compared to home depot or lowesI was really excited about this place when I had my first full set done.  I believe the owner (or at least manager) did them for me.  They were perfect, and she was quick and detailed.  Nails lasted 2 weeks so I returned for my backfill.....

Unfortunately, I got someone else who suggested that rather than do a backfill, since my white tips were still fresh she could just do a fill with polish.  By the next day my nails were a cracked up mess...

Off to find a new salon..  Sorry, I understand that some stylists can only do polish and pedis.  But if you put them in the acryllic chair I am thinking my nails should last longer than a day....I have been to the branch a few times since my original review.  If Chase monitors their comment pages, my review may have had and an effect.  I'm no longer asked questions about my financial services etc.We have been going to this Trader Joe's since they opened.  

But on Friday they did something I have never seen this grocery store do.  The person at the checkout, whom seemed very bored, put our bag of Trader Joe's potato chips flat on the bottom of the back which in turn cushioned all the other items he put on top.  A couple of cans, a jar of capers and some vegetables.  Now I guess he thought that they needed protection and unfortunately we didn't catch it until we got home and started to put the items away.  
Sure enough, neither the glass jar with the capers or the cans were damaged.  
Guess we will really have to watch from now on.  
Is that a new technique?
Oh, the chips were easier to chew in smaller pieces.Expensive. I was charged close to ten bucks for a bean burrito and a carne asada. Really? Taco Bell is next door!

The food was just okay. Very skimpy with the meat, and it felt like I was eating plain tortilla.

Heads up - drive through takes a minute. It's fresh though. Don't think I'd be back.Purchased a Groupon and thought it was a great deal. ( $40 worth of food for $20.) So my husband and I were craving Korean BBQ and headed out here on a week night.

We walked in and there were only 4 other people inside at the time. And they were non-Koreans which was surprising to see. The waitress was Korean and sat us down at a table. We decided to order my favorite meat (Chal Doel Begee) but she said they didn't get the delivery today so they were out. We then selected our 2nd choice which was Galbi and then she said they were out as well. 

We were definitely disappointed and we should have just walked out but we were too hungry.

She said the pork belly is their specialty and they had it in stock so we went ahead with that. Typically pork belly is a cheaper meat at Korean restaurants so I usually try and avoid ordering it. But had no choice. 

Growing up in LA, I've used to great side dishes at a Korean BBQ restaurant. They brought out 4-5. They also include green-onion mix(par-ree chae) as well as lettuce and garlic.

The total came out to $48 so we used our Groupon and in the end paid $28 including tip. 

It seemed like there was only one waitress working and one bus boy at the time. Since it wasn't busy, we didn't wait that long for food but I could see it being a long wait if there were bigger crowds.

It looked like they had a full bar but didn't see a bartender.

I'm not sure this is the standard of Korean dining in Arizona but if it is, i'm going to have to drive home to LA for Korean food in the future.

The only bright spot is they offer Karaoke and have separate rooms for that. Not sure how much that costs.I went with a large group (12) for a birthday. I ordered the french onion burger and it was not as good as I remember. I feel like it had less meat. Also, our service was pretty bad. My friend Xurri R. was there with me and her review goes into much more detail. We waited very long for drinks and refills, never got any check ins. Had to ask for things and they weren't that busy. 

It's pretty pricey. For 2 burgers, 1 cocktail, and 1 beer it was just shy of $50 before tip. 

Also, they served our cake that we brought, but I had number candles which had been taped to the cake and they freaking lost one. My friend was turning 20-something and they lost the 2! WTH?Well,  I really like my color, but I'm not sure if I like the color at my roots or the color on the ends. I won't be going back.

First of all, when I go to a pricier hair salon I don't want my hair person to be doing other people's hair in between unless it's a quick guy's cut while my hair color is lifting.  
I actually called a month before and left a message to set an appointment and they never called me back.  Bad business, should have been a sign.  
The girl I saw was really nice and a pleasure to chit chat with.  MIght be more fun over coffee instead of my head. 
I told her I hate, hate, hate red and when I got home the first thing my dad said is, "It's red."  ARRRGGGHHHH
I had a coupon, so I said yes to the blow dry.  The blow dry was 28 bucks and she did a half-ass job.  It was the worst style I ever had.  Had I known I could have used my coupon for product too I would have used it for that instead of wasting it on a crappy blow dry.  
It's not the worst color, and luckily some of the brassiness will tone down after a few washes, but I still won't be going back.  
I'm so glad I didn't let her cut my hair.  I got my hair cut at Focal Point Salon near Desert Ridge and it was the best haircut EVER and I am a pain in the butt when it comes to haircuts.  I will be getting my color there next time and looking forward to it. 
I do not recommend this salon if you do a full color and expect it to be the same from root to end.Tonight was rough. Deciding to visit on a whim, my brother and I sat down to watch the hockey game. The waitress was friendly and attentive and quickly took our order. After receiving our drinks, we waited roughly 30 minutes before getting our food - which was after two tables that were seated after us got their food. We ordered two of the Zips wings and we're happy until we looked closer  the chicken wings were very under-cooked. They were sent back and the staff handled it professionally. 

The only saving grace for this restaurant is its quality staff. (Even though we did not see a manager after the whole ordeal)Although the food itself was good and the restaurant appeared to be clean, the service was seriously lacking! Not a single person acknowledged my existence and I had to step up to the counter and ask if I could order. I never saw a single smile from any employee either. I guess you can't expect too much for a fast food joint, but this Wendy's could certainly step it up a notch.I have to give this place 2 stars solely based on my most recent visit. Normally, I get the orange peel chicken and it has always been good! Recently I've been on a tofu kick so I decided to give the tofu here a try instead of chicken. BAD CHOICE!!! The tofu came out in thin little burnt strips. I also tried the hot and sour soup which was also a disappointment.I had never been here before but my boyfriend insisted it was great. We went inside, ordered a pizza and sat down to wait. There was another couple next to us waiting also. An older lady came in and said she was there to pick up her order, which she placed on the phone. She had a $50 and the manager went CRAZY. He began scolding her in front of everyone about how he could not accept bills larger than $20. She said she had no idea, no one told her on the phone. The manager said, "Well, you should have told us when you ordered that you'd be using a $50 bill." All of us laughed at the guy, how ridiculous is this comment?! The manager then said," OK I'll accept it this time but I'll probably get into trouble." The lady said she was sorry, but her total was about $46 and she thought it made sense, a $50 bill is legal tender. The manager acted like he was doing her a huge favor, was very rude. About 10 minutes later when our order was ready, the manager said to us, "I'm sorry about that outburst, that was unprofessional. But some people just do whatever they want!" It was awkward and unprofessional for him to discuss it with us. His yelling at an older lady for trying to use a $50 bill had nothing to do with us. 
Anyway, the pizza was a little burnt, tasted just ok. I am pretty sure we will not be going to Rosati's again, simply because a) the pizza was not that great and b) I don't want to get yelled at.Went here for the first time yesterday.  Although it is clean and there was an okay selection,  I don't think I'll be back due to the extreme stink eye the loss prevention guy was giving me the entire time.  
I was with my two kids, who were a little on the obnoxious side.  However they were not screaming and running. They were playing in the aisles,  looking at the toys and fighting over things..... As 7 and 3 year old sisters tend to do.  
I'm pretty sure he followed me around for the last half of my time there and as I waited in line and mu kids wandered through the accessories, daggers were shooting out his eyes. I kind of felt like he thought we were going to rob him and wreck the place. 
I found a couple pairs of shoes for my youngest that I promised her I'd buy. Or I would have left without spending any money there.  
Pretty sure I'll only go back there if I have to.Sudo clean. Kitchen they provide comes with no pots, pans or silverware which kinda defeats the purpose of having a kitchen in a hotel room. So if u come bring ur own. The bed is most uncomfortable thing ever....like sleeping on floor. Was here for two weeks so went and purchased a 4 inch foam pad just to deal wit it. Is stay else where...Far from being good Mexican food. The rice has no flavor, tastes like plastic. The only thing that has good taste are the chips because both the salsa and the homemade beans are bland. We had a really nice server but he only stopped to see if we needed anything else hmmm...0 times! I did like how they bring you a mini pitcher for your beverage refills. Overall I thought I was way too expensive for the bland food that doesn't even deserve to be called a Mexican Restaurant.Came in and really liked the decor. Decorated very festive. Chips were better than the salsa which was pretty runny. The guacamole was bland. My husband and I both ordered burritos. They were just ok. Nothing too spectacular and mine wasn't that hot. I did like their rice which was probably the best thing I had there. Server was friendly but seemed kinda lost and forgetful which was weird since we were like only the third table there. Probably won't be back to try again for you don't really get your moneys worth.Couldn't get help to try on shoes (that I would have bought) but they have more than one person greeting at the door.  Great!  No service here, although the selection isn't so bad.Ok..this is so wrong...but I am the duchess here...mostly because it is the bank my boyfriend uses and this is our drive thru. SOOOO I happen to be in the car every with my handy hands ready to "check in". 

Being the duchess of this drive thru, I do feel bad saying that I am not a fan of Wells Fargo. I am a BOA kinda girl. Back in high school I got burned by a WF employee and switched. Yeah, I roll with grudges like that.

But Paul likes it so....its gets a 2 star!We came here for late breakfast..early lunch.. And I have to say I'm disappointed with all the hype my friends have for the joint. I got the cinnamon roll french toast and coffee. It didn't come with eggs, potatoes, meats nada.. Wait it came with an orange slice. Here's the kicker.. It cost me $14!! So many better places where I can get a huge breakfast for less. I'm actually still a little hungry :(Wouldn't you think Caesar's Palace could serve a decent Caesar's Salad? I mean c'mon, a lousy Caesar's Salad. So have you ever noticed how embarrassed the other casino hotels are about having food courts for the proletariat? When you go to, like, the Venetian, it's hidden away on a second floor. At the Bellagio, you barely notice it. Give Caesar's credit that they put theirs front and center in the casino right near the Colosseum's main entrance doors. 

Hell, I didn't even know the place had a name, but this is where Jamie W. sat as the non-gambling porkers we are and ate a quickie meal before both Cher and Bette Midler. Now I never find anything all that appetizing among the international chain of kiosks, but before Bette, I decided to try the Shrimp Caesar's Salad at one of them. It came in the standard plastic bowl with the standard plastic mini-cup of dressing. I actually don't remember much about it, but I can always count on the older Asian woman in the country kitchen outfit handing out toothpicks and busing tables. OK, that's all I got. 

FOOD - 2 stars...Caesar's hath no Caesar's salad worthy of the palace 
AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...it's a food court with faux-Roman statues...what d'ya expect? 
SERVICE - 2 stars...snail-like despite the throngs 
TOTAL - 2 stars...serves its purpose for pre-Cher and pre-Bette idle time...what can I say?...after spending do-re-mi on the shows, we're cheap!Expectations aren't too high for a 24 hour Subway within a casino, but perhaps if the employees weren't male and facing the screens of the sports book, service would be more attentive.

Visited this weekend while a major game was playing, wanting to grab a pizza- Subway pizza is delicious, try one if you haven't already.

Employee was polite but incredibly slow. Between carrying on a conversation with his coworker and staring at the game screen, the guy barely had the capacity left to focus on making my order. It was simple, too.

Received it finally, hot and delicious. Only complaint is that veggies were not chopped up prior to adding to the pizza- other locations have cut them into smaller pieces, as for the salads, before baking, but not here. Giant pieces of pepper and onion tore up the cheese as I ate my individual pieces.I have been to the Smith Center many times. Exquisite venue, with great acoustics. i saw KD Lang there, and the sound was amazing.

Sadly i wasted my 4th of July listening to a cacophony at the Smith Center.  i could not understand most of the lyrics or dialog.  i literally could not understand a single word the fat kid said.  I am sure it was a funny show.  The sight gags were great.

It was plenty loud, i walked away at the end of the night unable to hear my wife clearly.

It was a mixing disaster.  Who ever it was handling the sound should find another career, perhaps in a manufacturing plant where loud noise & unintelligible speech are the norm.

I will go back to Smith Center.  I know the sound there can be fantastic.  But this show left me feeling like I tossed 200 bucks in the trash.First they had a person who handled drinks, but couldn't order a beer from her. Weird! 

Another lady came and got our order and service was slow even it was not busy. 15 mins for our food?

Order their pho. The broth was not hot and the noodles were undercook. It really didn't do the job. Failed.Gonna keep this short and simple:

The Phoenix roll was good.

My Hibachi Filet/Shrimp was mediocre.  The flavor was bland, and they provided no sauce to spruce it up.  

I ordered Hibachi fried rice thinking that it would be similar to some of the rice I've had at the Hibachi restaurants where they cook in front of you.  Wrong.  Instead, I got Chinese food delivery rice.  Nothing about it was Japanese, and nothing about it was delicious.  Get this crap off of the menu.

My major complaint would have to be our waiter.  Uninterested does not begin to describe this man.  He took forever with our drinks.  He never filled our waters.  My "hibachi fried rice' was so bad that I wanted to ask for some white rice (Which was supposed to come with my meal).  Unfortunately, the waiter did not come by until about 35 minutes after we received our meals, and that was only to ask if we wanted the check.  

All of this for 30 bucks?  No thanks.I went with a group of coworkers on a recent work trip to Vegas.  The food was horrible!  It started out promising with a good tomato soup, but the main course looked and tasted like it had been heated in a microwave.  

The show was so bad that it was good.  It was increadibly cheesy, and the fighting wasn't even close to believable.  The stunt guys would go flying when the person attacking was still several feet away.  The sound is really hard to hear, so it was hard to follow the story line.  I didn't even realize there was a story until the show was almost over.  There were also some random elements, such as the acrobats, wizard, and midget...

Even though it was bad, we had a good time making fun of it.  I would not have paid the price of admission out of my own pocket if I had to.Just ok.  Not very much meat in #8 grill chicken sandwich.  Ordered 2 iced coffes, but they could only make 1.  I still choose Hue Tai for vietnamese sandwiches.Don't get me wrong, wasn't expecting much, and I had a great time w/friends as I always do when golfing. 

So, cafe is closed and you can buy beer, soda, water, chips, etc. when you check in, no coolers allowed but they were everywhere - obviously the place is suffering so much they just don't want to turn anyone away. 

The course itself is in bad disrepair - greens were like mini golf - hard, bumpy and some had huge holes. The rest of the course was hard as a rock too, and lots of dirt patches. What I did like was it was wide open and cheap - so a great practice spot for the short game. For $19 you play & get hand cart - a little pricey considering the lack of ammenitites, and condition of the course, but golfing on a neglected course still outweighs not golfing at all.The food is so good! Geez the service ruins it for me everytime. Slow. Slow. Slow. shouldnt ever have to ask for a refill on water when thats all your drinking?! At the end of my meal, before asking for the check I asked for more of the yogurt stuff that comes with the biryani. Took forever to get the check and when he brought it I had asked again for the sauce. Upon bringing it back, he mentioned he didnt put the side on the bill... not my fault. But he said it like he was doing me a favor hahah this is not the only time ive had slow service. It just seems like they dont care at all.Went here after our Shot of Java experience. Place is not dirty, but not clean either. Most of the patrons (3), seem to have an aversion to personal cleanliness. Spent $10 on two smoothies and threw them in the garbage a block away. Come on Glendale!It's Taco Time. Yeah, right!.  Just letting you know right now, not my idea to come here.  But it was a co-workers time to pick lunch and he swears by this place. Why you ask? I even wanted to know.  Well, this is the only Taco Time in Las Vegas and he grew up on this stuff back in Utah. Big deal...now let me eat.  

Nothing on the menu was appealing to me, both taste wise and calorie wise. I ended up pulling up the myfitnesspal app and found something decent.  I ended up getting their Crisp Chicken Burrito.  I know, their known for their burritos. I just didn't want to indulge knowing that a big dinner was within a few hours.  Their Crisp Chicken Burrito is basically a large deep fried taquito in my opinion.  Tasted okay, but that's about it. 

As for the ambiance...yeah right.  This Taco Time is located at a truck stop off Blue Diamond across from from the Silverton Casino/Hotel.  When you're in here, you almost forget you're in Las Vegas.  For a minute, I thought I was in Barstow or even Baker.  Service wasn't the best and they didn't even have forks.  Good gravy...I doubt I will stumble back in here.Really like their food...BUT THEIR SERVICE SUCKS!!!!. Been there a few times and always have had a service issue. called twice today and was put on hold each time by ashley for 5 mins. Second time was disconnect. Spoke with jesus the mgr. and got the same excuse given before about being too busy taking care of other customers. I informed them that I was a customer as well but tgat didnt seem to make a difference. Just decided to get a pizza from BJ s . If it is half as good it will be worth it . Maybe if if I had said we were ordering 5 large pizzas and several desserts it might have made a difference.The girls that were working were very nice
Overly nice
And helpful

Unfortunately, the cupcakes were overpriced and very average tasting.

I'll take Cake Cafe cupcakes anyday over these.  

They're open on Sundays which is a plus.This is the place we go for the perfectly average and uninspired "Mexican" food that was introduced to us by our parents.  For whatever reason this place is an institution to residents of Mesa.  Nevertheless it occasionally hits the spot when we are looking for Mexican comfort food.Mediocre at best, slight step up from Denny's. The biscuits were made from bisquick , there was no sausage in the anemic gravy and the chicken fried steak was just breaded hamburger. The Apple Danish was good though.Of course I feel like a freak being one of the few people to give this place less than 4 stars, however, I just don't see what the big deal is. Limited menu is some how elitist? What? Since when is that fashionable? What am I not seeing here? Apparently there is special lingo, and "in the loop" type service. How is that a good business practice and how can people play into this charade willingly? I just don't get it.

Bad, dry burgers, limp fries, limited menu, and hipster air. And I've been to different In-N-Out Burgers, all the same. Don't get it, I don't recommend.Okay...we are huge foodies, so maybe our bar is set a little high?  We truly liked the atmosphere, the staff was super nice, and they have a good variety of drinks to choose from.  Our appetizer salads were AWESOME...I had the wedge and my husband had the spinach.  And the sweet potato fries were incredible.  But seriously....if you are going to be a "burger bistro"....shouldn't you have absolutely KILLER burgers?  (aka. Zinburger @ Biltmore)  

I should have known when none of the burgers were really jumping off of the menu at either one of us.  We settled on the Buffalo and the Kobe.  The buffalo burger was boring, definitely underseasoned (ever heard of salt?), and the buns - where they were super soft and fresh - had a heavy taste of butter...I mean to the point of leaving a film on your tongue.  The kobe beef was delicious, seasoned well, but overcooked (I ordered medium-rare and got medium-well)...so the burger itself was boring.   It has asparagus and blue cheese...and, coming from a person that loves cheese, it is the lightest blue cheese ever...no punch at all, so relatively bland in flavor for this burger as well.  My husband even went so far as to say that he only had 2 good bites on his whole burger.

We are total burger lovers so we just weren't impressed.  Maybe we could try the "build it yourself" menu next time, but we were really hoping for some really good, imaginative burgers from the chef.  :(**Original review from 5/3/2011. Updating new profile.**

After trying the one in Gilbert several years ago, I was afraid to try this location. But I was hungry from fasting for a blood test and decided to try this location. I won't be going back.

For the record, this is not the same owner as the one in Gilbert (as I found out), and the food was much better than the one in Gilbert. I ordered a chicken shwarma plate with a side of hummus - to go. Instead of warning me that there's no lunch plate available for shwarma, only pita wraps, I was charged for a full priced dinner.  Nice.  Thanks.

The "dinner" comes with rice topped with a tomato sauce, salad or lentil soup and the shwarma. The shwarma had a great flavor, but was a little dry for my liking. The rice was overwatered, meaning it was mushy and they used too much water when cooking it. The tomato sauce they used to top the rice was good. What shocked me was that they put a small salad in the corner of my to-go box and the lettuce was covered with the warm rice and chicken. Gross. Soggy, warm lettuce. Ew. I cannot comment on the side salad I received because I forgot to tell him that I don't like creamy dressings and it was smothered in it.  My fault for not telling him.

They don't make their hummus fresh. Their hummus has the consistency and taste of the canned hummus you can buy at Haji Baba's down the street. It was over salted (canning process!) and they used too much oil for the consistency. I threw away my lunch half way through. I can get better food elsewhere.

If you are not familiar with Middle Eastern cooking, you will find this place good and charming. If you are familiar, I'm sure you know to steer clear of this place.i stopped coming her because im not a fan. the servers all have attitudes and the food isnt the best.The glass elevator ride on the way up presents a unique experience and a nice view of the Stratosphere and some parts of the Vegas Strip. This, along with attentive service and classic steakhouse ambiance promises a great meal. I was disappointed.

While the lobster bisque had some nice lobster chunks, the bisque's texture was gritty. I ordered the Filet Mignon (8oz for $36.95) crusted with bleu cheese for an extra few bucks to be medium rare but I received it overcooked. It was more medium/medium well than medium rare. A third of it was stringy and chewy. The bleu cheese crust well-complimented the steak but the green beans that accompanied the entree tasted watery. I expected more.Our reservation was for 6 and the maître d showed us to our table and acknowledged our anniversary. We didn't bring our own bottle and decided against getting wine. I got a Stella and my wife requested a Mojito but our waiter was quick to let her know that the bartender "sucked" at making Mojitos and talked her out of it.

We each ordered a Caesar Salad to start and they came in these bowls that were oddly shaped in that they were very wide on top and narrow on the bottom (contacting the table) that it was nearly impossible to cut the wedges of lettuce into edible portions without the bowl tipping over into your lap. Also there was WAY TOO MUCH Caesar dressing.

My wife went with a 16oz Prime Rib that was served with bone in and a Baked Potato "with everything". Fair warning to all that "everything" included bacon and cheese which she was not expecting. It was well prepared "Medium" and was very good. The crust was super good.

I ordered the 16oz Rib-Eye (Medium) along with the Garlic Mashed Potatoes. Well first off, it was no where near 16oz and second it just didn't look appetizing at all. It was charred on the outside and when I cut it in half straight down the middle there was no pink what so ever. In fact it was so over cooked that it wasn't even brown in the center, more of a grey.

Now I never send food back to a kitchen. I have seen too many news specials about what goes on back there. But this was not edible IMO so I broke that rule and sent it back requesting a new one. Oddly though I had 2 different people come and ask what was wrong and if I wanted it well done or something, as if they thought I was complaining that it was undercooked. So 3 different people were informed that I wanted it medium.

The waiter returned a short time later and let me know that if I wanted a new one that it would be 15-20 minutes and asked if I would like to change my order to something that would come quicker since my wife was already enjoying her meal. The first thing that crossed my mind was "if you are spending 15-20 minutes cooking a steak to medium, you are doing something terribly wrong. I then agreed to change my order to the Prime Rib since I had a few bites off my wife's plate and it was very good.

Mine though came out a smaller/thinner cut than hers and without the bone. It was also much more of a center cut so I got very little of the awesome crust that was all around hers. It was tough and just not good. I suffered through it though and ate the thing. The Garlic Mash on the side was OK but not anything better than I have had at Sizzler.

They did bring us a complimentary dessert and again acknowledge our anniversary.

Bottom line is next year we will be back at Texas de Brazil. Why mess with something that works. We will never go back to Binions Steakhouse. I would have been much happier at the Buffet in The Fremont across the street.I am really disappointed in 2 of the dishes that I got. The papaya salad was really bitter. And I wanted it medium spicy but all I tasted was bitterness from the lime skin. The sticky rice was super hard and not edible. I think they overheated leftover sticky rice! My food wasn't complete without sticky rice. I never send food back in restaurants but I should of in this case. 

Their fried chicken wings and duck fried rice was good though.Good taste but bad service .. Asked me to pay before I even finished eating half way ..I've passed this place so many times and finally got to go in it. 
It's located right by the Monte Carlo and it always looked packed from the outside. So for a Halloween weekend I was very surprised how not busy it was on the inside. We had reservations so our host told us to go upstairs and our waitress would show us our seat. 
The view was great and luckily it was nice outside when we started dinner. Here is where the problems started though. The table we got was lopsided. It was one of the low tables with the couches and I've never had such a lopsided tabled before. I ended up sticking my menu under it to keep it balanced. She took our drink orders and my boyfriend doesn't drink so he ordered a pink lemonade and I got a strawberry daiquiri. Our friend's ended up just getting a beer and a water. 
After a good while our waitress comes over and brings us our drinks. She put down a margarita on the edge of the table and we didn't notice until my boyfriend looks for his pink lemonade. Took her another ten minutes to come back over and we tell her the mistake. She was apologetic and let us have it for free since it wasn't even our drink. I don't know where she kept going though because it took her a good while to come back with his drink again but she gave him two to make up for it. She took our orders. I ordered the baby back ribs, my boyfriend the Combo nachos, both friends ended up getting the chicken burrito. One of them asked for no sauce on the burrito.
They brought out the food and the server handed her a burrito with sauce on it. She even asked him "this is the one with no sauce right?" and he told her yes it was. He handed us the rest of the food and the waitress told him that the order was wrong and she apologized again and took it back for her.
It took her at LEAST twenty minutes to get her a new burrito, luckily we all gave her parts of our food.
Here's a lowdown on the food we got. 
Ribs were good, came with coleslaw and onion rings. The ribs were dryer than I usually like it but each to their own, I enjoyed them.
The nachos were FANTASTIC defiantly one of the best nachos I've ever gotten to try. They also should be shared with at least three people. Got lots of left overs on that one.
Friends said their burritos were good but were not fond of how spicy the beans were. If you like really spicy you will like their beans.
Chips and salsa were good. Friend said she really liked the salsa.
Calamari was good, nothing special though
Potato skins were good too.
If they just improve their service I would defiantly rate this restaurant higher.Really disappoint！not like traditional Sichuan food! Only taste spicy no other flavor. And they really ridiculous!! They write tips for me! And ask me for signature! ! I think the tip is what I want to pay, you have no rights to write it for me! 一点也不好吃。还要强加小费。单子拿过来的时候小费已经写好了。直接跟我所要签名。我觉得小费应该我们自己来填写。你这么做是觉得我们消费者没有素质不给小费？！Wow. Talk about overrated !

Okay so I only ordered a Tuna salad, because I really wasn't that hungry, but my other gfs ordered sandwiches and according to them it was an overall, 'Mehh.'  

'Mehh' as in..you can find a much better bang for your buck at a local sandwich shop in your neck of the woods. Items aren't expensive so I give them that. They have everything you would find: hot sandwiches (duh), wraps, salads, coffee/tea, potato chips, breakfast options, and even dessert ! There's a lot of history behind this franchise..250 years to be exact so they must be doing something right ?! Uhh..right ?? Unfortunately, my experience wasn't quite enticing or memorable.

Earl of Sandwich is like Subway - As in, you place a sandwich shop all by its' lonesome away from potential competition and not many food options available and you'll get hoards of people to come in. Smart Earl. Real smart. Due to its' Vegas location (i.e., inside Planet Hollywood), I'm not surprised many people line up here. This is an easy 'grab n go' meal-type setting and when in Viva Las Vegas, sometimes you just want a quick fix while you go around galavanting Sin City.  

Okay..so on to my food:

How can you mess up Tuna salad right ? Well, you sure can in this case. Waaaay overdressed and it reminded me of 'cafeteria food' where the ladies in aprons and hair nets use those hand scoopers to pile on a ball of coleslaw or mash potato on you cafeteria tray. Ya..I got a tuna ball *insert imagination* ! I should have known better, but I was really craving a salad. Is this premade? I could have sworn I saw some tossing up front. Oh..and I hate when they dress the salad for you. I like it on the side. I should have asked prior, but everyone seemed to be in a rush to order and move out the way. So I grabbed my salad and herbal hot green tea and went on my merry way.

Rating Scale from 1-5:

Appearance: Ball of Tuna = 1  
Taste: Mushy, overdressed, still edible = 2
Originality: If cafeteria food is original, then I MUST be from another planet = -1

Overall score: 2 stars because I enjoyed my herbal hot green tea and the salad wasn't that expensive (thank goodness !)

So maybe I should have gotten a damn sandwich, but I wasn't feelin' it at the time and my gfs weren't that impressed by it either. Would I give this place another shot ? If I had no other choice, maybe. Ok yes. No maybe. Ha !Perhaps I'm just not a sandwich fan....I honestly do not understand why so many people are fascinated by their sandwiches. 

Menu is your typical deli meat selection. They make their own bread there and it is toasted for each bite. I find the bread being really greasy as I constantly have to wipe my hands while holding the sandwich. 

I think it's a great sandwich shop (friendly, efficient, inexpensive, open 24hrs) but their sandwiches did not have any wow factor for me.I had lunch at Thai Hut for the first time this week.  

My first impression was not at all favorable as I drove into the parking lot.  There was trash littering the parking lot, and the side of the building and the door were dirty.  It was not an inviting scene and I almost left.  

Once inside, the scene was more favorable though walking through a deserted dining room to get to the front room also did not leave a good impression.  I thought I had really made a mistake coming to Thai Hut.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the front area of the restaurant was very nice, bright, and clean.  The servers greeted me warmly.  My server was delightful, helpful and cheerful.  She gave me time to decide, answered my questions knowledgeably, and delivered my meal quickly. All the servers were professional and warm.  That was a good sign. 

The soup and egg roll that accompanied my lunch were a nice touch, though the soup was much too salty for my taste.  I ordered the glass noodles.  While the dish was okay, it was also salty and lacked the flavorfulness I enjoy when eating the same dish at Siam or Thai Lahna or Touch of Thai.  I was hoping this would be a great restaurant, but it's not.  It was nothing special, and left me wishing for something really good.Its a nice location and the staff was attentive. I tried the Calamari to start and the fazzoletto Trevi. While the portion of calamari was generous (and included tentacles!) the taste got old very quick. It didn;t help that it tasted better without the sauce they had brought out with it. My main course was not as portion generous and didn;t have much taste except for the mushroom sauce. It was a very one dimensional dish. 
So many other places to try instead of this one......I was really excited to hear about this place but when I went there I was disappointed. I was hoping for a really nice tea room or a cute little boho place. This was neither. It was hard surfaces and dank. I looked at the selection and didn't see anything that excited me- I have an really good selection at home. So...I went home and brewed myself a cup for a LOT less money.A total chipotle rip-off. They have the same setup, with the white rice (with green seaweed things in it) and choice of meat beans etc. The prices are higher than Chipotle, a buritto was more than $6. The people weren't especially friendly or anything, but not a big deal. The food is nothing special, unoriginal, and expensive. If you'd like food that is exactally like Chipotle, then you may as well actually go to Chipotle and pay less for a meal.My friend and I met there for lunch and basically served ourselves.  I had to ask for menus then 20 minutes later I waved down the waitress to place our order then I asked for napkins then I asked for silverware and finally, when I saw our waitress walking around with her handbag, I asked for our check!  At which time I was told to just come around the corner and take care of it.  The food was good but the service was Horrible!  Cute place that I thought would show the west side had some sophistication but....NOT!!  Dont think I'll be returning!Ewwwww


Are people just giving this place good reviews bc they want to pretend like they're super cool and are totally down with hole in the wall places in the hood?? 

Bc this was seriously nast. We ordered the queso w chorizo and that was bomb, I'll give them that.

Our food came out, I had one bite of my chilaquiles and was like ready to spit it out. The green sauce was creepy and the steak was very off in flavor and not seasoned at all. I asked for a to go box and boxed up the steak to feed my dogs. 

My friend ordered their torta. She was like 'I can't tell if I don't like this bc it's gross or bc I'm full' I tasted it and was like 'bc it's gross.' she called me today to tell me she tried eating it for breakfast but threw it out bc it was nasty. 

We'll be sticking to the torta from Gallo Blanco, bc even though their service sucks, at least their torta is amazeballs. 

Seriously some of the grossest food I've tasted. The staff was friendly and the place was clean and packed. I just personally find the food super nasty.Seats are comfy when you've been walking around all weekend. That's why it gets two stars.
My friends and I came in on a slow Sunday morning to watch the game and relax, and after sitting for 20 minutes and the cocktail waitress glancing over at us she found herself too busy eating her fritos to come and offer us any drinks or even say hello. 
I love PH, but I think I'll explore other bar options if I really wanna get my drink on.Just got back from staying in Palazzo for one nite. Honestly I expected better. 
PRO:
- The suite is big. The decor seems to reflect some decent investment
- location location location
- some folks are really nice (front desk, bell man) and aim to please

CON:
- Attention to details: i can clearly see the strek mark on the marble (someone cleaned it but not really fully). for a 5 star... that seems like a miss. 
- Cleaniness - there was hair ... HAIR in the bath tub (its very obvious.. cant miss it!) and even stickers on the wall of bathroom. (ew). The glasses in the hotel room looks yucky too.
- Furniture took some abuse. Looks like someone sneeze into the couch and it tried (ew ew)
- Service - We were waiting at LAVO to get in. The host pretty much ignore us for 5 mins despite we were right in front of her. She just kept talking to her server. Also, the manager(?) came by close to mid nite and says "Someone opened a bottle and I need this table now, I will buy a round". Ehhhh We can pay for my own drink. A little patience woudl be good ... we were going to be leaving. His attitude was pretty bad. 

bottleline, I dont think I want to go back and likley will ask my friends to check out other hotels. Palazzo doesnt seem up to par for me at all.Its very sad when the food is good, but the wait staff are less then kind.  My waiter didn't take the time to say anything except, can I take your order? Then while my 7 yr old son was contemplating  what he wanted to drink, waiter just walked away, I guess 10 seconds is to long for him to wait for a decision. Then he returns and says "are you ready to order now? Very Rude.Probably the WORST buffet in Las Vegas. This place makes the already not-so-great, Vegas buffet in Glendale, CA. look good.

(http://www.yelp.com/biz/vegas-seafood-buffet-glendale#hrid:JnIwxV7PDcIRU7PhAETMrA) 

I bet Imperial Palace's buffet (do they have one?) is better. I know the Flamingo buffet is. 

The line to get in is like waiting for Riddler's Revenge in Six Flags Magic Mountain. Too bad it doesn't store as much excitement. Usually people line up for vegas buffets because the food is actually good. This just has a line because they give everyone who stays in the hotel, two for one meal vouchers. I should know, I had one.

When you finally get in, you think the line is finally over. WRONG! You enter and you line up to get food. From the PATHETIC sushi selection, to the chow mein makers, to the g0Dd@mn salad bar. lines, lines, LINES! By this point, I am starving. The salad maker wouldn't even help me. There was 1 lady helping 25 people in line. TI, would you please hire more employees? 

I barely tried anything in this buffet. I stuck to the American/BBQ section. Their (spare)ribs were dry, the chicken was OK, and I piled up on the collard greens. Honestly, I was so hungry, I was just eating whatever to shut my belly up. The desserts were not memorable. Though I do love me some buffet cookies. 

I will not be back.. Unless I get another free voucher.. Which may not be likely because I never want to stay at TI again. It's just a ghetto hotel that needs to be destroyed already. Time for a new skyscraper hotel again.My yelp review for the missing dozen wings got the Manager's attention back in December 20, 2012, so I thought I would write an update.  Message from the Manager:

I have put you in my manager log for a dozen wings on us.  Please let us know immediately if there is ever a problem and we will happily correct it. If you wouldn't mind updating your yelp review stating that this has been resolved, we would greatly appreciate it.

That is nice that they really read the reviews.  I just have not had time to go back since December.  Thanks for reaching out to your customers.Its ok. Not Great. The service was awesome. But the food was kind of disappointing.Not too bad of a place, has late breakfast.  The service is pretty slow and sucky.  I was happy they had pancakes.  I was not too happy when I came home and noticed they added an additional tip to my credit card.  I had the matter corrected.  I really hate stuff like that.  I left a tip, the service was slow and our drinks were not refilled.  An additional $5 should have not been added to my card-beware of that.  Won't go here again.Went here on Thursday, but it was just "The Living Room" - meaning they just opened the small lounge area. If I want to be in a living room I would have stayed at home. So, Thursdays are a no-go there. 

Went back on Friday after meeting up with a promoter and getting a free table with 20 other girls. It was...eh. Hosted by Miss USA chicks and Lil Jon. Last Lil Jon party I went to at Jet and was cracking! Don't know what happened- maybe we left too early. Went with another promoter to get walked into Tryst- which was 10 times better.Guy, I love you on 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives' and all. But you rave about every place you go to. And you go to a lot of places. That makes you not very credible in my book.

Since I already had breakfast at the hotel, I wanted something small to nibble on while the other girls ate. But then the PB&J french toast on the menu caught my eye. Mental image of thick toast with swirls of peanut butter and syrup-like jam with powdered sugar. I couldn't resist ordering!

The server later informed me that they only have half an order of the french toast and asked whether I wanted a half order of something else. Since I wasn't hungry, I told her that the half order is fine. But at the same time I was wondering how on earth do they only have half an order. Did they run out of bread??

One by one my friends' orders arrived. Big plates of hearty looking food. Then mine arrived, on a dinky plate. Sitting there in loneliness and despair. 

PB&J French Toast (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=FTpZP-NSq5VuEXC_S73C6w): Are you friggin kidding me?! This is like a Smuckers Uncrustable! Not french toast! (http://uncrustableforschools.com/showimage.asp?fileid=2178) Angry! Was not tasty and didn't finish it. I made sure that I did not have to pay full price for this. Luckily, they took the whole item off the bill.

Smoked Salmon & Mushroom Omelet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=7IF34zeAOIegxtukbZle-A): Huge! The tatertots were good. But unfortunately, the omelet itself was dry. The smoked salmon was overly salty.

The Over Easy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=mngAq_ySH-uFP-GVVQdS_g): Their version of eggs florentine. Didn't try it, but looked good.

Brioche French Toast (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8R_oemw4rNjJL6sd40O_oQ?select=gXPle1ZaQQgd8xSRZaFsew): If my french toast looked anything like that I would've been less pissed.

Cool place. Nice staff. Mediocre food.I wish that Yelp would let you give stars on specific aspects of the experience and then average a star rating because parts of my Breakfast Buffet experience were decent and parts were terrible.

First the good:

The food, it was good.  Nothing spectacular, but exactly what I expected from a buffet at the Flamingo.  Decent variety, food was fresh.  I had eggs about 300 ways (with chorizo, rancheros, breakfast burrito, benedict) and they were all good.  The shrimp cocktail was the bomb, the chocolate fountain was just kitschy enough to be fun.  I wouldn't complain.  I left full and ate nothing that was disappointing.

The blah:
The price.  Right at $50 for 2 Breakfast buffets, food only.  Not worth it.  I can't eat that much for breakfast, and I know how much eggs cost.  Breakfast buffets should never run over $20 bucks unless I can get lobster, and maybe bottomless mimosas.

The bad:
The service!   The women working the cash registers were rude.  Our server was incredibly overwhelmed, which was not the real problem.  The problem was the other servers in other areas refusing to step in and help out.  All we needed to drink were waters.  It took us 20 minutes to get water.  I tried to flag down 3 servers outside of our own who was serving tables as fast as she could and I was shrugged of by each although their areas were obviously slower than ours.  That was a major disappointment.  Our server was incredibly polite and apologetic about the wait and once she caught herself up, was very attentive.  But overall there was a lack of team work to keep things flowing and customers happy.

Overall I was happy with the food, but for 25 bucks a head I feel like I can expect decent customer service as well.  That was lacking and I would not go back or recommend this buffet to others because of this.  Sorry Flamingo, you have to do better.There is another listing of this eatery place here on Yelp!

I am aware of this place for the past 10 years. I rarely bought stuff here... the displayed cooked dishes looked ordinary.

I went for BBQ pork today. I asked the butcher for one pound of meat. I asked her to pick the lean meat from the stacks.

She made a bad mistake and not shy about it. Even though she has picked a piece already more than 1 lb, she sneaked in another leftover piece and charged me accordingly. Finally tally was 1.33 lbs.

I have seen butchers picked meat to make over the requested weight, but they never added more on purpose.

By the way, the cut of meat is fatty even though I asked for lean meat. I believe all the meats were fat to start with.

So shoppers, this is a dishonest behavior. If it can happen to me, it will happen to you too. Heed my warning. BEWARE!!!!!Was very underwhelmed with Table 10. After our meal we were wishing we spent the extra coin and gone to Delmonico. 

We had the calamari, which was pretty good. We also had the ribeye and leg of lamb. The lamb was juicy but chewy. The ribeye was supposedly prepared in the same manner as those at Delmonico, but this boneless cut was no match for the real deal. 

Service was good.Such a shame this place has such terrible service because the atmosphere and happy hour is great! Have rented a karaoke room, came for lunch and did happy hour... Every time horrible service! Long waits for food and drinks, servers and bartenders have poor attitudes... Pretty sure we won't be backWent for lunch. Nice seating indoors and out. Quiet though for lunchtime. We had the koobideh and the chicken kabob. Lunch comes with salad and rice as well as a grilled tomato. The food was great EXCEPT that one of the tomatoes clearly had mold on it and the chef/owner tried to say that the tomato changes to white/grey mold color when cooked. So not only did he give me mold to eat but then lied about what it was. 
4 star food but 1 star service from the owner
*disclaimer* our server was great however
...not sure if I should go back...should I?The biggest strike against this restaurant was the intrusive wait staff.  They made a nonstop effort to up-sell menu items:
"Since you have a large party, we have some great wines in large-format bottles that might make the most sense for you." ($200+)
"If you're interested in Kobe Style beef your best choice is probably the Steak Tasting." ($160)
"Actually, our most premium beer is Chimay Blue.  Would you like that instead?"   (I love Chimay, but is "most premium" really supposed to be my selection criteria?  What does that even mean?)

The food was generally tasty, not all of the steak came as ordered, and I would have appreciated a complimentary cheeseburger with my $12 fries.Personally, I didn't like it. It's considered the number 2 steakhouse in Vegas. I ordered the ribeye and shared sides with our party creamed spinach, mushrooms and mac and cheese. Honestly, none of it was memorable. Felt that the steak was too heavy and lacking flavor. I didn't even finish an eighth of my steak. :(Bad service, mediocre food.  Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it'll do in a pinch.Wow, this show is truly bad.  I don't know about everyone else, but I think the whole Coyote Ugly thing is played out.  Let me sum up this show...a bunch of sexy half naked men and women on two different ships trying to battle. The men by firing cannons, and the women by talking and dancing sexy to really crappy music that must've come from a strip club.
  I haven't seen the old show, but I heard it was MUCH MUCH better with actual swash buckling and etc. I must say I felt sorry for all the parents who were there with their children and quickly left after seeing the garbage that is Sirens of TI.  My group of 16 people (half girls and guys) all agreed this show was a complete waste of time. I give some credit that the show is free, and has some cool pyrotechnics. But believe me it really isn't worth seeing and dealing with crowd after the show is done.
   I did hear this in the crowd though by a group of douche like guys... "Dude..those girls were so hot, that was such a cool show". If you want to see some free softcore TNA then I guess watch this. I understand Vegas is going back to it's Sin City roots, but this show really was crap. If you want free entertainment, watch the Volcanic Eruption at the Mirage, or the Bellagio Fountains, much much better IMO. and if you really want TNA, you're in Vegas, spend some money and go to a strip club.
~GI love Chipotle. However, this particular location is not as good as the others. They gave me a smaller amount of the meat than the others do (really skimpy) and when I asked about it, did nothing to correct it. They treated me like I had the problem. I will go to the location at 67th and Beardsley or 83rd ave and Bell from here on out where they seem to have the same standards on how much of each ingredient to use.I have lived in Europe and wanna-be-Italian restaurants in the States are just always disappointing to me. The only thing I liked there was the fresh bread. My husband ordered the grilled salmon over angel hair pasta and I had the risotto. The grilled salmon was very plain and almost dry.. really nothing special. A small piece of salmon over a bed of pasta... The risotto almost made me cry.. It had BACON in it! The bacon flavor was so overwhelming I really couldn't eat it. Don't give me wrong I do like bacon BUT not in ITALIAN risotto... Thats just wrong! Sorry! Service wasn't perfect either.. We paid about $40 for 2 people (small appetizer included) no drinks and I left the restaurant hungry and unsatisfied.Like other reviewers, I tried this place out because it is conveniently located close to home. 

Ordered the take out, off of the dinner menu. The one that includes a spring roll and a wonton. Didn't realize that neither of those were included in my bag when I reached home. The Moo Goo Gai Pan was decent, but it is difficult to mess up. The pork fried rice was interesting- seemed a little over cooked to me but it tasted decent. 

I might go again in the far future, but I'll definitely make sure to check my bag before I leave the restaurant.The location is awesome but hmmmm its alright. Not really exciting about their bread...Nice rooms. The reason for the two star rating is the POOR customer service we received at check in. We spent 40 minutes with the front desk lady .She could not find our reservation.The woman that was helping us was the most unprofessional front desk staff that i have ever had to deal with in my life. She could not answer one question I had. She was more worried about charging my credit card .I've exp. better.

 Bread and butter is apparently not served at this restaurant, regardless of the pic on Yelp. The server must've had a big section b/c it took her FOREVER to serve us. The wait was about 10 minutes until she even showed up. She was nice throughout dinner when she showed up. The bus boy just stood around as the water glass sat empty. 

They have an option where you can purchase 3 sides for $28 dollars, but neglect to list the price of sides solo. They are $9 each we found out although we ordered 3 sides. (the deal makes no sense mathmatically). I inquired if they were large enough to share and she said they weren't. That's odd b/c the cast iron pan of Mac and Chz could easily serve three people. Also, if you bring in your own cake its a $4 chg per person, which they waived. And they auto-grat parties of 6 or more. 

Prices are about $40 per entree and the Scottish Salmon and Prime Rib were delicious! The Mac and cheese wasn't anything to rave about.

Looking back...the experience was worse than I thought.The food was fantastic tonight, but there was zero service. We seated ourselves after waiting 10 minutes with no eye contact from the staff.  I notified a waitress that we were seating ourselves.  She brought us menus, our food, and then we sat and sat waiting for our check when we were finished.  My husband was ready to walk out without paying when I finally just walked over to our waitress again and told her we needed our check.  Honestly, there are not that many tables and there was plenty of wait staff, but the whole timing was way off.  The couple next to us ordered their food not long after us, but ended up just watching us eat, as their food never came.  We would have just walked out.  We left before they were ever served. I felt so bad for them!   Next time we're in town, we're trying somewhere else.  I'm on the search for another soup dumpling place once again.  :(Looking at the other reviews I think that maybe I came on an off day. Though I do think it's kinda interesting that there is such a things as "Mexican-American" food... wouldn't it just be American food? Or "Food of the Americas", I like that better....

Anhyoo, the food was only ok, and I was the only customer at the time so you'd figure I'd get better service. But the plus was the drink. So if you're in the mood to go to a bar and the Heart Bar is too busy, go to Yolos for a drink, but skip the beans and salsa.

Enjoy a Martini for me!I just wanted to write an update because I finally stopped in for lunch and I was very underwhelmed. Portions seem to be much smaller for sandwich and salad items, which is disappointing. Our turkey sandwich had very little meat (but lots of lettuce) and the country potatoes were cold when they arrived. (I knew the potatoes would be a mistake!) And the San Fransisco Spinach Salad, while served on a giant plate, is very small when you realize that the plate only has a very thin layer of spinach and very few toppings. At $8.95 it would be nice if it came with a few pieces of meat as well. Oh and even the fruit cup you can add for $1 was smaller today at lunch than it was last week at breakfast!  

I'll stick with breakfast at The Good Egg.Meh.... $20 for a chicken Caesar salad is a tough sell even in town square. Too much good competion in the same mall for that.I enjoyed the food very much but the service needs a little bit of work in my opinion. Upon being sat it took us multiple times of asking people to get a waiter so that we could order drinks and food. The food was good but when service is slow it is going to lower my score for the place. There was a dish that was forgot and the waiter failed to ask if we wanted to order more beer. The other issue I had was we went during happy hour and had a menu with certain prices and after we tallied everything up our bill came and was a bit higher with some items having the regular price not the happy hour prices. Brought this to everyone's attention that we could but ultimately nothing got changed so we paid our tab and left to go enjoy some cocktails elsewhere. The food itself would get this place at least a 3 1/2-4 stars, wouldn't say their food is 5 star worthy but the service definitely brings down the score.Ate at Claim Jumper recently (week night, party of three).  

We had 2 salads and a child's order of pasta.  We waited for well over 20+ min.

On top of this, I had to ask our waitress 3 (three) times for juice and more dressing.

Needs improving.do. not. get. the. burger. with. blue. cheese.

it was inconsistent among the 4 that we ordered--some more pungent than others, to the point of inedible. i ordered it mainly for the caramelized onions that i was unable to taste at all. i had to drown my burger in ketchup to help the flavor. i couldnt finish the last bite.

the potato fries were on point. i should've just had a meal of that.I totally had no plans on having anything negative to say about a late night burger joint that has a full bar available until around 2 am on a weeknight. Based on my first experience, it would appear that I was wrong in my thinking. 

I decided to go in around 11pm one night with a friend on the recommendation of a buddy that had tried out BLT recently for the first time as well. 

I am a sucker for a good martini and a great burger, (or steak but in this case a burger.) I ordered a Vodka martini and some chicken wings for my friend and I. They had 3 sauces available and I asked the server to mix it up with a few of each kind. He said "No we can't do that". He said.. NO WE CANT DO THAT. Lol... I know that being a Vegas local, I am used to most restaurant's giving you want you want to an extent. It's not like I was changing a recipe.. I wanted a bit of three different styles of wings, all the same price, no change in the portion size. At that, he didn't offer an explanation... just NO. So i'm like, cool.. We will just take them Spicy. No big deal.

The martini arrives. The server literally kicked a few pieces of trash on the way to the table when delivering the drink. Looking around, there was trash everywhere. I  mean alot of trash, not like a little bit. Many dirty tables and the floor was ridiculous. I'm guessing it was due to being understaffed, because the server took off after delivering my drink before I could order. 

Long story short, the second martini was a different size (less), I mentioned it and the server said they were trying to close up the bar. The wings didn't taste right, and when I asked the waiter why they tasted burnt.. he said they are "double cooked".. when I mentioned that I think the oil  they were frying them in was old, he said "oh really". 

Haha.. listen guys, I'm not that bad of a food snob, this is wings, burgers and martinis.. if it doesn't taste right I'm not going to just eat it. 

Burgers show up, over cooked but still tasty.. onion rings... burnt tasting and apparently fried in the same oil as the wings as they did not taste right.. like rancid oil was the flavor. The server dissapeared, most likely afraid of me asking him more questions. 

Finally he came back with the bill, and even as it was just after midnight he seemed to be rushing us. I asked about the 'deep fried oreos' as I had not had them before and he ordered them for us. Listed on the menu they were to be served with a berry sauce. They showed up with a ramekin of melted vanilla ice cream. When I asked about the berry sauce, he said "it's not served with that'. I showed him the menu, and he said the menu was wrong. LMAO. This guy is a piece of work, and I actually had to laugh out loud. I just let it go and ate the Oreo's, paid the bill and left. 

I'll go back for one of these shakes someday.. the spiked ones every one talks about. It will be earlier in the evening when there is a full staff, a manager and when they aren't trying to close down the place for the night.

Happy Eating!OK food but awkward layout and poorly trained staff.  

Half the time I order by number and the girl taking my order has no clue what I'm trying to order.  Often they put my name down in an unrecognizable spelling that when they call my order, I have no idea it's me.  

The takeout orders are handed out in the middle of the ordering line so you have people bumping up against you while you sit and wait.  

The steak and chicken almost always have several big chunks of gristle you have to spit out.

After a year of alternating between Yoshi's and Yogi's, it's time for me to go back to Yoshi's exclusively.Though I like the pharmacist, the pharm techs at this location have the WORST customer service! Several times they did not fill my Rx within 24 hours, for different reasons. Never did they call me or my doctor and try to resolve the situation ... they just waited till I showed back up to inform me there was a problem. No apologies, not even a smile. 

The pharmacist once overheard me telling the tech that I had come back three times and my Rx still hadn't been filled. He offered me a gift card and apologized for my trouble, and I was very grateful. But really, me having to return three times for an Rx I fill every month? Inexcusable. 

Once I walked up to the RX counter inside the store to ask where to find an OTC medicine. I was sick, could barely function, and the tech didn't even look up from her cell phone ... she just said, "Isle ten." I said, "I looked in isle ten and didn't see it." She totally ignored me and kept texting!! I muttered, "Thanks for nothing," and stumbled away. Thankfully the same sweet pharmacist saw the interaction and dropped what he was doing to come and help me. 

There's a creepy tech with a greezy skullett that is rude every time (he has screwed up my Rx twice). Now he just takes my money and shoves my Rx through the window at me. 

If it wasn't for the exemplary pharmacist, and the close proximity to my house, I would never return to this location.I went with my boyfriend for dinner for my birthday we had reservations at 6:45 pm. We arrived early and the restaurant wasn't very busy. The hostess seated us at a two top table in the farthest corner of the garden terrace room. It was basically the worst table in the entire restaurant. We asked to be moved to a different table just to hear that it was reserved. Not sure what the difference is since we had a reservation in place for weeks. We sat down and waited for 15 minutes before some one took our cocktail order. I ordered a scotch chilled and the waiter says "you mean chilled as in chilled, shaken and poured" I guess if I would've said it in French it would've made sense. Is "chilled" so hard to understand. Anyway we realized that the service was not going to be efficient so we asks for some bread just to be told that we cannot have any bread until we ordered our meals. That there was a "sequence" they had to adhere to. It's a little crazy that we were about To spend over a thousand dollars on a meal and we had to listen to the bread nazis about sequence. Our meals had included black truffles which by the way have been out of season since the end of January, needless to say the truffles were tastless and hardly worth the "supplemental" additional charges. When it was time for the cheese which we ordered for two we noticed another couple sat at the same shitty table we sat at opposite the room they were obviously not happy with the seating so they asked to move to the booth we wanted and were moved with no question.  The same hostess that sat us said without hesitation "oh sure no problem" and they were sat at the booth. I guess it was only "reserved" when we asked. I could go on about this overpriced French pretentious joke of a restaurant but I will just sit and continue to wait for our dessert. Did I mention I wrote this entire review while sitting here waiting for some one to clear our plates. Horrible service. Will not dine here again6 months ago, we ate here and there was a nasty stench of raw sewage and insence. (not working as a cover-up) Tried it again and stink was gone. Went back today and the smell was so bad that we immediately turned heel and walked out.  the people walking in behind us left too. Bummer, because we love the pho and ban xiao (spelling?).  Owners, pay whatever it takes to fix this problem, and we will be back!This place is just like every other extended stay on the strip, run down and broken, pool is gross, jacuzzi is gross. You got people who let there kids run around like wild animals so that kinda makes things even more undesirable. My room smelled  like kitty liter when I checked in so had to rush out and buy a bunch of fabreeze to mask the smell. All in all this is a place seems like a haven for people who can't get a real apartment because of credit issues, past evictions or whatever made them end up here. Will be getting out of here ASAP ,,,Went here to meet up with friends on Friday afternoon for happy hour only to find that they do not have any drink specials.  Wtf?  What good are $3 appetizers if I am paying $9 for a glass of wine?  That did not make me very "happy".  Also, the bar area was insanely crowded so good luck finding a place to sit.  I really don't get why everyone is so freakishly excited about this happy hour when in reality it is not even a happy hour, they are just running a sale on appetizers.  What a scam!

Once we got a table on the patio we had a pleasant enough time in spite of the fact that our server, Amanda, was god-aweful.  I had a chopped salad that was just ok and also split the Calabrese flatbread with my sister which was quite delicious earned them an extra star, but isn't enough for me to want to go back any time soon.I am confused about the previous reviews - unless something has changed drastically in the recent past, the previous reviewers are sushi noobs or have very little discretion or taste.

The place is clean, the service is prompt and kind, and that's where the positives end.

The food (what there was of it) tasted great... but a 3/4' diameter salmon roll?  Please.

Long story short - the prices are high for the tiny portions you get, and while the complimentary miso soup and half a chilled orange were nice touches, I'll be skipping this place in the future.

Try Akai-hana on I-17 and Northern if you want the real deal for less $.Overly priced Chinese food. Service was high end which was way better than your typical hole in a wall Chinese restaurant. It's just the food was so mediocre even the hole in a wall places are much better. I mean really $17 for a bowl of pho? I don't think so. I will not come back for sure.We have dinned at the Scottsdale Fleming, it was excellent service and outstanding food.  I was so dissapointed that this Glendale location does not measure up!  The decor and atompshere is there but just not the same.  Looks like it, doesn't feel like it.  We were greeted immedately and seated as our reserved table for 6 (Saturday night - before Mother's day).  The wine list was fancy (electronic tablet).  

Our server was just NOT attentive at ALL and made the experience basically SUCK.
-She never mentioned the specials for the day (the list on laying on the table, someone discovered it later)
-She brought the wrong beverage
-She has to come back to ask was we ordered because she couldn't read her handwriting
-Never was around to grab her attention

Now to the food, two of our group stressed that they needed they meats cooked well done.  One of the filet mignons was to be butterflied to make sure it is well done and the other sliced filet migon was to be well done.  Well, the ladies got their filets and they are still oozing blood.  Come on a butterflied filet migon and a SLICED filet migon not well done?  Really???  Especially on the sliced one, when you slice it and see blood and pink = NOT well done.  We had to send the 2 plates back.  The guest of honor had to sit was watch some of start to eat.  Don't get me wrong, my steak was perfect and tasted great.  You are a steakhouse, getting steaks cooked to the right temperature is your forte!  

I am surprised that a Manager was not send out to appoloize or at least talk to the table when we had to send back 2 of the 6 main entrees.  He came by at the end to do a quick hello and how was everything...  Well, it sucked but nothing you can do now at this point!The club sucks... tiny dance floor and expensive drinks... get your party on for free downstairs. The music is better and there is a lot of room to sit and chill with friends  =)the casino is to bright ! the baffett was small not a lot to choose from . snaps is better !!I have mixed feelings about this Trat. 

Visiting Las Vegas last week, we wanted an intimate dinner before seeing The Phantom at the Venetian, and the Trattoria Reggiano is only a moment's walk from the theater. In light of the other reviews here, it seemed an inspired choice. It was less than that. 

On arrival, on a not-terribly-busy Thursday evening after the theater - about 9 PM - it looked terribly inviting: Tables in the walkway as if a true Italian trat, and a few booths and tables inside near the open kitchen. Charming. We asked the Maitre' d for a booth (it helps my hearing, which is very poor), and were told we would not have it, and were shown to a table inside by the wall. OK, but a disappointment, even though it saved me $10 top to the Maitre' d, who seemed oblivious.  

Delicious bread, with decent oil and vinegar, rapidly arrived, as did our waiter, who I asked for a recommendation between the spaghetti with meatballs ("filet mignon") and the linquine bolognese. "Eh!" He said. "It's the same sauce, just not in a meatball."  Ummmm. The staff says the food is the same?  Disquieting. 

My pasta and my wife's Ziti arrived almost immediately, as we were still on our first piece of bread. Good service is not the same as fast service; this isn't Pasta Now, but a relaxing meal. Still, it was hot and freshly prepared. The Bolognese was tasty, and (as usual) I ate half, expecting to take it back to our room for lunch the next day. My wife, who eats like a bird, ate about a quarter of her Ziti, and as the second waiter came to remove our dishes, I said, "It was delicious, but we want to take it with us." He nodded and left.

 A few moments later, our waiter returned with a check - strangely, for an Italian restaurant, without asking if we wanted dessert - and I asked, "Where is our food." I got blank looks; the second waiter said, "Thrown out."  Argument follows. Finally, the headwaiter said, "Wait. We'll recook for you." This time, it takes longer, but when the bag returns, there are two tins inside; I look in the top one, and find bread. "Where is my linguine?" I ask. Blank looks all over again. More argument. Finally, another recook, we take the food, and leave. 

The service is obviously challenging, perhaps due in part to there being several languages and accents going on among the staff. The food was good, but not great; the meat sauce lacked seasoning (garlic is not all there is in this world). The Ziti was nice, but as it sat on the table, the cheese started changing from gentle yellow to bright orange. "Cheese powder, perhaps?" said my wife. But it was good, albeit a bit incandescent in appearance.  The ambiance was very good, with a slight hint of New York Italian as a result of the dark stained booths. 

Overall, better than the food court next door, but not the place for the intimate and relaxing after-theater supper that many might wish.For our last night in Vegas we were looking for something a little on the cheap. The roulette wheel was not kind to us. The Venetian website listed this as a casual dining place in the one $ price range so it seemed like it'd be the perfect place. 

For two glasses of wine, some meatballs for an app, and two pasta dishes we walked out $90 poorer. When you start approaching the $100 range I'm thinking of a decent place back home on Federal Hill in Providence or the North End in Boston. While Trattoria Reggiano wasn't bad, it certainly wasn't worth it. 

It's a small place with some very crowded tables outside the restaurant. We were quickly seated at one of these and it had all the atmosphere of a mall food court. By the end of the meal I felt as I intimately knew the couple on the side of us because we could easily hear the conversation as well as we could hear our own. Luckily the small children on the other side of us were extremely well behaved because being stuffed so closed to them, it had the potential for disaster. 

The service was ok, but there was a team of four guys working the place and each of the four had a hand in our service. We didn't have one set waiter. One of the guys didn't like to talk and took our order with mumbles and gestures, but the rest of the guys were nice enough. 

The small plate of tortelini I had was decent enough, but nothing to write home about. The gnocci that the girlfriend had was drowning in pesto and wasn't homemade. 

We would've had a cheaper and more enjoyable dinner at Olive Garden. We threw money away like drunken sailors all week and then picked a bad time to try searching out an inexpensive option. We would've been much better off dropping a few extra bucks on a nicer place.I am not sure how to rate this place. The first time we went we loved it, the second time it was nasty.
 How do you go from awesome to nasty?
 The first time we had a nice chatty waitress and I ordered eggplant and my party the chicken. No problems, well cokked pasta and out this world well preparted eggplant. There aren't many places out here who don't mess up eggplant. We took home a pizza for hubby, he got sick for two days. I think it was possibly msg as he is allergic, no one said they used it. It  wasn't food poisoning. 
 A few weeks later we were in the area and went back. He ordered a meatball sub which was simply older bread with breadballs. Not meatballs, but breadballs, there was so little meat and so much breading they were actually a funny color. And they made this huge deal out of him saving 1.25... give me a break! The first time the eggplant was homemade and stacked a certain way, this time it was little fired up medallions ( probably from Trader Joes frozen food section) that stunk and was a huge rip off for the meal price. For some reason we did not complain, we just secretly whispered " We are never coming back".
  The different waitress we had the second time around was ok. Kind of cold and I don't know.. that day we just got the  "Lets see what we can get away with" vibe. As in money was all not the customers. If they ran out of eggplant they should have said so and recommended another dish. How simple is that?! Substitution without explanation is a major no no... 
 So for all the people who had bad experiences with the service I believe them 100%. There did not seem to be much consideration for the customer, if they didn't try pulling anything they would have had some new loyal customers. This place seems to lack common sense when it comes to service. I know a chef from a local place who will just be honest and tell people " We are too busy to fill that order now". And you know I go there all the time and still do I have never been disappointed. This Montesanos placce will apparently leave people hanging for 30 minutes trying to call in an order.. Unreal.
 So I doubt I'll go here again unless I am in the area with someone who really wants to go.. But I'll offer to pay if they'll just go across the parking lot to Panera instead....I have used them about 10 times and thought I was getting an upscale experience. I was wrong.

1.  Service seems spot on and accurate in terms of order taking and knowledge.

2.  The reception / store area is quality and high class. They have areas for kids, restroom, drinks and many small things you can buy. Very nice. They even used to have a computer to use for googling, but finally they removed it. Cashier is even nice and friendly.

3.  Actual Car Wash and detailing.  YIKES.  What happened?  I was all impressed by the ambiance of the place and how classy it was.  The car wash itself is great. People using brushes to  hand scrub the cars in all areas. The detailing is extremely poor.

4.  More on Detailing - They never dry the top roof of my truck, so as soon as I drive out, the windshield gets water all over it. They use dirty towels that after one or two days, you can see all the swirls and "ghosting" of what and how they wiped the windows. They miss spots when doing the upholstery armor all. They ofter will forget and give you the ultimate service you paid for and instead give you the  regular service. You have to stay on top of them. I asked them to clean the cup holders as there was some spilled drink it it. They completely did not do it.

5.  Basically, they sell a great service, but cannot deliver consistently with any quality.Hit or miss. I've eaten at this restaurant several times now because it's so close to work. LOVED their curry lunch special. Recently, everything seems to be going down hill. The potatos and carrots in my curry always seem raw and the owner is just plain rude. I've had it delivered a couple times and it always seems to arrive at least 1 1/2 - 2 hrs later. Foods ok.Great pizza chain but so so in execution. Usually have to wait longer than usual for this location and felt sick a couple times. Hope their ingredients are fresh and being well taken care of. The delivery should be more faster.Before I say anything else, I love Texas de Brazil! However, as a regular customer at the Schaumburg branch in Illinois, this place is very disappointing and almost not worth the money. I don't even know where to start. First, our host told us our wait time would be approximately 10 minutes, but ended up being more than double that time even though it wasn't such a busy hour. Their salad bar seemed incomplete, dry, and slow to be replenished with fresh food. The sushi they serve isn't the same and isn't as good as the kind I'm used to. I love the goat cheese (best I've ever had) but when I went to get the toasted bread chips (not sure if that's their actual name) there were hardly any and the remaining few were stale. They do not serve seared ahi tuna as well as portabella mushrooms, both of which I normally get from the salad bar during dinner hours. (If you haven't tried it here, you're definitely missing out on some of the better food they have to offer). The mashed potatoes were bland and the bananas seemed rushed to get to the table. They were dry and not as soft and fully cooked. The meat is somewhat more flavorful although most of them were too raw to eat. I had to throw out about half of the pieces :( The servers and our waiter did not even ask how we like our meats cooked. 

The service was poor. Meat servers were slow to come to our table and seldom came. They constantly passed us without asking if we wanted some and were not careful with cutting the meats. My cuts were either too thick or too small and I was constantly being splattered with blood from them. If it wasn't for our waiter putting in orders for the meats we specified, we would have waited even longer to be served. Never in my experiences at Texas de Brazil did I wait more than 5 minutes (after hitting the salad bar and turning my card over to green of course) to be served some meat. We had been seated almost 25 minutes and still not one meat server came to our table. In fact, while I was waiting I had to slowly fill myself up with their cheese bread which I had to keep asking for more myself since the other servers did not bother or failed to notice to provide us a fresh basket. In addition, a manager never visited our table which is something that always happens when I go there to eat no matter what time during the day. 

Aside from all of that Texas de Brazil is a great restaurant and definitely a good place to go for a date. Groups are ok, but I would only recommend it if you have purchased their VIP card sold for a limited time. All of the other reviews prove true for the restaurant in general. If it wasn't for the service, I would have rated it higher... maybe it was an off night. If anything maybe this branch should hire more people. 

Happy yelping:)The only reason why I gave this salon 2 stars was because of the length of their foot massage.

1. My manicurist cut me not once, but twice - to the point my cuticles would not stop bleeding.  

2. My clear coat came off in ONE day.Your basic neighborhood bar.  Was there on a Thursday night at 9.  Service was chaotic as the waitress was working the entire room, including behind the bar.  Food was over-priced. Took probably 45 minutes between placing the food order and actually geting it, and they mixed some of the order up.  DO NOT order the pork tenderloin sandwich they offer as the Thursday night special.  Had to track the waitress down to pay the bill.

Service - Slow and chaotic
Food - Over-priced and Meh.The place has potential but is not impressive as it is currently.  I live in downtown Mesa and was excited to investigate the Bistro.  It's basically directly across the street from the Mesa Art Center, so I was thinking it might be a good place to go before or after a show.  The decor is inviting with a bar and a small seating area w/ club chairs, a small stage area by the window where a musician was playing and an assortment of tables including a space for a larger party near the kitchen.  I had made reservations online and we were seated promptly. (Did I mention it was a Friday evening?)
Then the problems started...I had planned my meal in advance using the website menu, however our server informed us that the wine I wanted wasn't available and the price for my backup wine was $50 a bottle (online the price was $33).  My date & I are both light eaters, so we opted to share the Caesar salad.  The size of the salad is not sufficient to split not to mention the lettuce was oxidized. (I suspect it was from the prior day or perhaps even bagged lettuce) Our server was polite but neither offered us an alternative salad or to remove the charge from our bill.  For our main course we both ordered options from the pasta menu (I should mention that the pasta menu was not on the website)  My lobster ravioli was fair but certainly not excellent.  An overwhelming amount of tomato sauce remained on my plate after eating all 4 of the raviolis.
At this point, a manager came to our table to defend the salad and her pricing.  I quote "we charge so much for a glass of wine because we prefer not to serve it by the glass."  I have to ask why do you charge such astronomical prices for the bottle then as nobody in there right mind would pay that much.
In summary, I might return in the future to explore another entree but I won't be drinking any alcohol and I certainly won't complain as it falls on deaf ears.On a referral write-up we read in a well received Phoenix Food publication, my Fiance & I put America's Taco Shop on our list of 'must visits,' as we both absolutely LOVE great Mexican Food. Consequently, after some time lapse from the date of reading the esteemed recommendation of this Shop having 'THE GREATEST CARNE ASADA in the Valley,' we FINALLY visited and experienced their food last night for dinner.  We ordered 2 Carne Asada Burritos (regular size) and 2 Carne Asada Tacos, just as they are prepared, unmodified.  The tacos are without a doubt good.  However, they are standard Asada street tacos in size and with garnishing.  Outside of happy hour times, these Asada tacos are sold at $2.35 each, not at all a good value, however, during happy hour, they're only $1.00 a piece, which is appropriate, relative to what one receives in portion.  The burritos, when ordered in the regular size, can easily be referred to and identified as a junior sized burrito, which will set you back about $6.00 a piece...This is UNHEARD of in the Valley, where GREAT MEXICAN FOOD abounds and is generally offered at a very good value.  Not the case here.  Food was good, but certainly NOT THE GREATEST CARNE ASADA in the Valley...Not even marginally.  Needless to say, my Fiance and I were equally disappointed with our findings.  Therefore, we will not return nor recommend America's Taco Shop as a 'must visit' Asada stop to any of our friends or colleagues; UNLESS one finds themselves in an unusual bind and it's happy hour time...Then buy all means, take your dollar bills and order the Asada tacos and a Margarita then call it an afternoon.  Should you be looking for a REAL MEXICAN FOOD experience with highly anticipated supreme flavors and substantial portions, do yourself a favor and pass on this place.Preface - We stayed at Club 36 over Labor Day weekend as part of a vacation club sales package via Bass Pro. 

The Good - 

(See The Bad #2)  Maintenance was quick to remedy all problems in a timely manner.  

The Bad - 

1) Upon booking 3 months prior, I had reserved a Handicapped Suite. With a HC room, we wouldn't need to bring a shower bench/chair. 4 weeks prior to arrival, I call to see about extending our stay by a day. I again get confirmation that we have a HC suite. 1 week prior to arrival, I verify that we do have a HC suite booked for our reservation. Now, upon arrival, we are given a non-HC room. FAIL! They luckily had a HC suite available. If they hadn't, we would have had a serious problem.  

2) The bathroom had major water issues. The toilet wouldn't flush. And the big one - The shower basin had no lip to keep the water from flooding into the rest of the tile floored bathroom. Not good when one of you is missing a leg and the other just had knee surgery. 

The Ugly - 

Our presentation was scheduled at 9:00 am the morning after check-in.  

The presentation is rapid-fire, and given at a dizzying pace. They state that they will only take 90-120 minutes, but don't even get through with the property tour until 180 minutes in. Questions are deferred as long as possible in the hopes that you'll forget.  The answers to any questions you do remember are presented as special information that you can only get as an owner. The entire format is war of attrition between them and your willpower; sapping you of Blood-sugar, energy, and focus, by rapidly firing off information. 

The entire thing seems gauged to get you as off-balance as possible, with an impending sense of urgency, making one reach for the checkbook, as opposed to the centers of reason in the human brain.  They are supposed to show you, and allow you to read,  (Per Nevada State Law) the documents with ALL the property offerings in the form of the Public Offering Statement, PRIOR TO SIGNING.  That they did not.  They even misrepresented a document as the Public Offering Statement, which was not discovered until later on that evening.  

Critical thinking is the enemy of the Bluegreen presentation. 

For those who are considering purchasing, be sure to request "private time" to review the program rules and procedures.  DO NOT TAKE WHAT THE SALESPERSON SAYS AT FACE VALUE.  Weigh and consider the Resort point charges per night and the RCI program outlined in the first few sections of the large Resort Binder.  

The sales pitch you are given, stating that you will be able to vacation free for the rest of your life, is a bunch of BS.  Doing some serious investigative work once we returned home, I discovered (via disclosure from one of the BG reps through whom you would normally book your vacation) the conversion value is 5000 points = about $200.00  I'm sorry but spending $28K for 20,000 points a year at that conversion rate (when we were told our BG vacations would be free) is not a good deal to me.  It's more like a RIP OFF!  

If you do sign and have second thoughts, make sure you follow the current rescission instructions TO THE LETTER.  

At present, Nevada State Law only gives you 5 DAYS to send in the rescission notice.  It must be sent to the corporate offices in Boca Raton, FL.  Overnight the paperwork along with ALL materials (Bluegreen and RCI books) given, with receipt return confirmation.  Make copies of everything you mail to the corporate offices.  I went as far as to having both the rescission paper and my own personal rescission letter (which included the date of signing, our contract #, etc) notarized. 

As of 9/12/11: In Nevada, the purchaser of a timeshare may cancel, by written notice, the contract of sale until midnight of the fifth calendar day following the date of EXECUTION of the contract. The contract of sale  MUST  include a statement of this right. The notice of cancellation may be delivered personally to the developer or sent by certified mail or telegraph to the business address of the developer. 
The developer shall, within 15 days after receipt of the notice of cancellation, return all payments made by the purchaser. 

Today, 9/28/11, makes day 15, and upon checking my bank account, I see that the credit was made to my account, less $75 for the materials (the vacation books).  The $75 we were told would be credited after we return the materials, which they received on 9/28/11.    

Update - 12/28/11 - Still waiting for my $75 to be refunded from the BG Vegas Sales Center.Whistle Binkies is a confusing one. I have had some completely different experiences here- once I came across a great jam session and had a fantastic time and the next time it was just plain awful- the clientele seemed to be mostly sleazy old men pretending to be hot shots and the music was bad. 

It's a live music bar and you don't really approach here for the over-priced drinks- rather for who is playing. The variety is so random so I can't really classify it as a particular genre of music place. Check their website is my best bet.

The location is just off the Royal Mile and seems to be surrounded by drunk and puking in the early hours neds.However, you can easily leave and go to one of the many other establishments in the area- so you aren't exactly stuck in the middle of no where if you decide you don't like it. 

 It's a bit too hot and cold though to rely your night on, but on a positive note you may get a great night out of it.I had walked by Smoke Stack on Broughton Street many times, and I had been wanting to try it for a while now. When a Groupon voucher came up for two breakfasts, two orange juices and two coffees/teas for £10, I jumped at this great deal. 

A friend and I showed up on Sunday, really excited to try Smoke Stack. The orange juices came out, and I was really disappointed that they were the horrid British orange juice from concentrate that pops up way too often to make sense. I just don't know how people drink the stuff and why they tolerate it! I had expected some nice freshly squeezed orange juice but was sorely disappointed. At least my cappuccino was fairly good and compensated it.

With five different types on the Smoke Stack menu and with waffles dominating all of the breakfast options, I thought I was in good hands since that was what they seemed to do best. My friend and I each had the waffles with bacon and maple syrup. The waffles weren't terribly hot and were served with the maple syrup already poured over everything - an obvious mistake since it drenches the waffles and makes them soggy, and also doesn't let us customise how much syrup we want, or the quality of the pouring. I'm sounding like a snob here, but it seems really easy and logical for me to serve the syrup in a nice little pitcher so that customers can decide if they want syrup just in the middle (like I received) or evenly distributed in each waffle dent. Anyway, the waffle was ok but nothing special, especially when soggy with the maple syrup. 

I was just really excited about trying Smoke Stack, and really disappointed that they hadn't done better. At least I was on the deal since it certainly wouldn't be worth spending £20 on brunch here. Also, I was a bit annoyed that the servers weren't friendly at all, and they also hid us away downstairs even though I had made my booking weeks ago and had assumed we would have had a nicer table upstairs. Oh well.Mixed feelings about Bert's.  It was a busy day when we popped in so perhaps that's why things just weren't up to scratch. Food was luke warm (though they replaced one dish with a piping hot one) and we had to wait for half an hour for it to arrive. Id expect a wait like that for a complex order, but we're talking steak pie and chips and neither was much to write home about. 

Good selection of beers with a few decent labels on show so maybe a good place for a pre-town pint. For anything else I'll be heading elsewhere.Meh. It's so close to my uni that I come here often but it's just ... so ... meh. I agree with Jenny over  here that it's absolutely soulless.

Often times you'll sit down and the waitress will actually forget that you're there -while you're sitting in the middle of the restaurant in front of three of 'em standing around chatting-. Alzheimer Light? Or I-don't-give-a-shit-about-my-crappy-job. I'm guessing the latter.

Look, if it's between Nero in Blackwells and Biblos, I'll choose Biblos because, well, their seats are comfier, and that's the only reason, but in all fairness, it's quite .. bad.

As a matter of fact, I should stop coming here altogether. It's just so ... convenient, damn you Biblos.

Look if you want a good burger and fries, skip Biblos and head up the street to Mums, and if you want a good coffee, the cafe across the road from them -though smaller- serves far better brew, but if you don't care and just want to be left alone, sit in at Biblos, I promise you, it will be quite ... forgettable.We just ate here on a whim, sure that all these great reviews could not lead us astray. Two hours later, we have our answer: Yelp has failed us. Our starter was given away to the table behind us (with no apology, though we could clearly hear the servers discussing the mistake), my husband did not get the menu item he ordered, and my dish (lamb rack) was hardly tasty enough to make up for the tiny portion and eternal wait. When we got our bill, the server left us with the credit card machine for so long that we finished the process ourselves and had to leave the machine on the table. I think most of these issues could be solved with more employees.  I'd steer clear of Iris until they get more and/or better staff.The Cocktails were good.
Everything is made of ice, including the glasses.
Even though I didn't pay for anything, I don't think I will ever come back.
Minus 5 is a place where you want to visit at least once and check it off your list.Atmosphere is great, but the service was subpar.  The tables next to us were offered samples of margaritas and overall seemed to have better service.  We will likely not return, expenisve food which was average at best.Hm... most items in La Senza just look naff and cheap and the whole place nearly went tits up (pardon the pun) a few years ago and I'm surprised it's still open for business. 

I found it hilarious as after visiting a few Euro shops in Berlin and Dresden most of their underwear was from La Senza. Are things that bad La Senza that you have to flog off your poorly made garments for one euro? Apparently so.

I have to admit, they do offer some cosy jammies and I got a nice tartan teddy pair in the January sales but apart from the jammies the underwear is pretty rubbish. Most of the undies are in garish colours, like bright pink or luminous orange so if you want your knickers to glow in the dark then there's a good range here. In addition to bad pants, every bra I've ever bought from here is always too small even when I buy my usual size that does the job everywhere else.

I dunno... La Senza used to be nice and I used to enjoy buying friends nice gifts wrapped in pretty boxes with scented beads inside. The La Senza fad is definitely done and dusted, or perhaps I've just grown out of it.It was good, but not great. I guess I'm spoiled with how well Asian Fusion is done at Gingerootz in Appleton.PIZZA HUT!! After the whole $10 for any pizza promotion my boy and I started using Pizza Hut.  It is the BEST!!!!!  The thin crust supreme is so good.  we are totally addicted.  We always get the spicy boneless wings, and two large supreme pizzas (so we have left overs) and it comes to about $30.  Staff is friendly and English speaking.  The delivery is fast.This was not my first time there.....last time I had a much better meal.  I can't say that anything was really bad, but the portions were so small and the prices were rather steep considering the size of the portion.  I ended up going out a couple hours after dinner to another restaurant for an appetizer as I was still hungry.  There are too many restaurants in the area that are better and less expensive so this will probably be my last visit here for awhile.We discovered this place from a Groupon deal my girlfriend saw. Even though the deal was gone we still wanted to try the restaurant out. 
I was very disappointed in the food. My gf said the restroom was dirty and the toilet did not work. 
I envision this is one of those restaurants you would see on the Food Network makeover shows. This place needs some serious help.
The appetizer we ordered was the crab and cheese wontons, for $10. I immediately thought these were from a supermarket freezer. Only 5 were on the plate with a crappy lettuce and something garnish. Of course I always think a garnish is pretty ridiculous. 
I could have bought a better appetizer at Trader Joes for 4 bucks.
For the meal, we ordered one Pad Thai for $14 and would split it. Again, disappointed. It was a very small portion, even for one person, and was something I could have bought in a box and plastic wrapping at WalMart for $2.88.  
I'm happy to try new places, and glad to know which ones to never go back to. This one I will not return to.The prime rib was over cooked.  The pork loin was dry.  Not a large selection of desserts.  They got rid of the black velvet chocolate cake.Bunch of college kids you know? What do you really expect when they rather be partying than running a store. A few dudes seemed cool enough at least to direct and actually show me to the bathroom. Other than that, it's just a college store.I cam here with a group of people for my birthday, and I would say it was the worst meal i had in vegas. the food was far too heavy- some of it was decently good, but most of it was just too thick and heavy. I don't eat red meat, so I probably should not have gone to a steakhouse for my birthday. None of us liked the food, the service was mediocre. The decor was great though, as was the location.Terrible. Bad employee attitudes and lack of team work. The poppyseed muffin was so hard it crumbled into crunchy pieces. Wasted money. Went to Starbucks for lemon pound cake. ..yummmBefore you read on, you should probably know I don't like fudge...

The fudge kitchen's reputation preceeds the actual place! Whenever I tell someone I live in Edinburgh, they almost always ask about the fudge kitchen. And I understand why - it's sitting on the Royal Mile and the smell wafts up the street all day long. As I said, I don't like fudge, but I do like smelling it. What's wrong with that? My brothers love fudge, and always go in to get one of their free samples.
yes, free samples! They always have a sample on the counter of one of their specialities. Although use caution when going to get some - my brother got caught out. Mortified isn't the word.

One of the things I quite like about the fudge kitchen is the people - they literally drag you into the shop because they know that once you're in, you won't want to leave. But when I say drag, I mean it in the nicest way possible - they are really friendly and funny! During the festival they join the acts on the street and get tourists in.

Unfortunately, it didn't float my boat. But it's a great way to experience Scottish tradition and load up on energy to climb all the hills in EdinburghI have to start with the fact that we haven't had Thai food before. 
The hostess was very nice and sat us and got our drinks. Sadly, it went downhill from there. My husband asked to sample a small amount of sauce to see if he would like it before getting an entree and after much back and forth was told no. We got a soup that I enjoyed somewhat but it had something odd in it that was not meat or mushroom no one asked how it was. Both of our entrees had ok flavor but both dishes had meat that was very tough and off flavor, my beef his chicken. Again she never asked if everything was okay. She asked if I wanted a to go and when I said no took my plate either not noticing or choosing not to see that all the meat was still there. So was it just that we are not fond of Thai food? Maybe but the service was less than helpful. I got the feeling that they have their regulars and if no one else comes they are okay with that?
So if your a Thai enthusiast and know what you like go for it, but if it's new to you I would say find a more friendly to the newbie joint.There seems to be a lot of controversy regarding the HuHot, let me try and explain why I understand both sides...no, actually there's nothing to understand--the general premise is that HuHot and most Mongolian Grills in general heap large/unlimited portions of bland uninspired food at you and expect you to be awed by the concept of a large stir-fry and wide array of ingredients.

To over-analyze it some, this premise if you can call it that is inherently flawed because at its core what makes a good restaurant is quality of ingredients, quality of preparation and service.  Service here basically is to explain the concept; so shakes out as largely a non-factor.  HuHot's ingredients are soooo bland, the meats are frozen and have no marinade or rub to them, the freezing of the vegetables results in the same end-result. 

Supporters want to clamor that the sauces give flavor and you can choose whatever you like! (like you can't find something at a normal restaurant) But the sauces are just alright and merely an attempt to cover up the blandness problem.  

HuHot is tolerable for where it is on the "new" west-side of Madison as it's a relatively quick n easy lunch spot for all the new offices out there.  And I'll admit I find their stereotypical Asian menu rather amusing.  But one could create a tastier stir-fry at home.  The Parthenon is one of man's greatest constructions but without any skill it's just a pile of rocks.Food was ok. Large portions. Employees there were rude and everyone in line felt very rushed to order (Wasn't even busy). Also place didn't seem very clean.I was happy until I went to this TGI Friday's for happy our and ruined my mood. 
Let me first tell you that TGIF is one of my favorite chain restaurants, I usually go to the one at the Orleans casino but this time there was some kind of event going on and they were real busy, I had set my heart on the steak and lobster so I decided to take the trip all the way across town to the sun coast.
When I got there the place was almost empty and honestly I was happy it was since I was starving. The hostess offered us to sit at the bar area so I we take advantage of the happy hour which we agreed.... and happiness was over.
 We waited for a long time to order our drinks, we waited a lot time to order our appetizers then we waited a long time to order our entrees and having worked in the service industry I'm the first one to stand in defense of the help. I understand that many things can happen that affects good service, problems at home, bad management, crew under staffed, super busy, but when it happens to me that's when understanding stops, specially when the place is this dead, I could find no excuse for him but that we didn't fit the waiter's ideal tipping customer's profile?
 By this time I was willing to ignore the waiters sad service during happy hour, get my own beers at the bar and concentrate on my much anticipated steak and lobster.
 Short version .....WTF!Lackluster food, unpleasant service. Otherwise, this is a fairly unremarkable establishment, after all.NOT A FAN OF COMMERCIAL Food. 

I came here for their 2 for $20 deal where you get 2 main entrees and an appetizer.. 
The service was slow and it wasn't like the joint was crazy packed. Came here for lunch at around 1pm.. and no one was there.. we didn't get refilled on our drinks until we were about done eating.. mind you, we were the ONLY one there it seemed like.. I had the skillet chicken entree with lots of cheese.. it was good, but because the service was terrible I had to give 2 stars!!Yes, its a beautiful, architectually designed hotel that is so over the top that you have to use a damn remote control to close the curtains.
The SIMPLE things and ammenties do not exisit! I stayed in the Sky Suite. The room itself was clean, the bed was very comfy, but when it came to just basic stuff, it just pissed me off. I wanted to listen to music on an ipod or a radio. Not happening, you have to press 20 buttons on the remote and still no chance you will get what you want. They wanted to make it "green" apparently, but I wasn't diggin on it.  

 I ate at a Cafe there, don't remember the name, but the service was excellent, food was cooked to perfection and yes it was pricey but expected. 

Definitly get your car valet parked.

The entrance and getting to your room is NOT convenient at all. You have to walk 6-7 minutes just from the strip to get to the entrance of the hotel, then another 10 minutes walking thru the casino with your suitcase and crap to get to your room which the elevators are located in the back! It sucks!! Of course, they have it laid out that way on purpose, to get you suckered in to throwing some $ down on the slots, etc. But , its a pain in the ass to haul everything, especially on your last day, when all you want is OUT of there.Meh. We were looking for food out by my grandparent's place in the Vegas outskirts. They wanted Pizza Hut, but the rest of us wanted something "better". Wood-fired pizza sounded like it'd hit the spot.

Upon being seated we were presented with our low-contrast menus. The low light--unnecessary for a pizza joint even if it's supposed to be "fancy"--made them almost impossible to read. The options looked good enough: normal "meat" pies, pies with arugula and balsamic, bbq chicken... we got one of each. I got some pot stickers because I had a feeling that "gourmet" meant "small".

The potstickers were of the previously-frozen variety (I know, what should I expect from potstickers from a pizza joint) and were tasty, but nothing I couldn't have gotten from Trader Joe's. The pizzas were better than previously-frozen quality, but they were like that guy in the bar trying so hard to be cool but just looked like a dick. The crust was fine but did not have much of a "wood fired" flavor. The toppings were ok, but nothing really wowed us.

Our server tried to be friendly, but like everything else at this place seemed a bit awkward and out of place. The ambient noise--a feature of the tile floors and solid walls more than anything actually going on--made it difficult for us to hear each other, further frustrating the situation.

I can't believe I'm recommending Chili's, but it *is* across the parking lot from this place and you know what you're getting...Management soured my experience. 
Typically I love this place, but usually eat at Egg Works (my friend prefers it)  However, I had purchased a Groupon to The Cracked Egg so I needed to use it.  The catch. I accidentally purchased a groupon that I could only use Mon-Fri.  Since I am always at work M-F, It ended up expiring.  If anyone knows anything about Groupon it states right on the page that the value you used to purchase the groupon never expires.  So I figured taking it in on a Sunday, at least I would be able to use the original amount towards my meal.  The server curtly told me that they would not accept it.  When I asked to see a manager, she came over with an attitude and refused to acknowledge my explanation or even listen to anything I wanted to say.  She kept repeating we will not take it.  I felt that she was incredibly rude and will unfortunately not return to this location because of her.  It is really unfortunate for me, because the food was absolutely delicious.  Probably one of the better breakfasts I've eaten.  But I refuse to go to a restaurant where the management will not even listen to what I have to say.  I also feel that it would not have effected the store if she would have honored the original groupon price.  Thank goodness for me I can still go to Egg Works.  They have always treated me with respect and smiles.Maybe its new, but it sure is on the slow side?  Maybe I got a bad crew day.  The employees sure were unfriendly and seriously 1 napkin for 3 meals?  1 sauce for 10 nuggets?  I had to keep asking for stuff.  Maybe more fast food places like this will make me not want to eat fast food.Stayed for 4 nights. On the second day I reported our bathtub isn't draining, this wasn't fixed until the last night of our stay. Rust in the bathroom and kitchen. Room also had an odd smell. 

Decent selection of channels and safe location. Friendly staff and comfy beds.This review is by default getting 2 stars.  The Frozen Hot Chocolate should get like a 3-4 stars but I can't do it.

Must warn people of the horrible service here... at least the outdoor patio.  I get it, sort of, that it was Labor Day weekend.  But seriously it should NEVER take 15 minutes to get a glass of water.  When its 95 outside you seriously should try and keep your customers happy.  I guess they do not want any repeat business.

I believe the table we were sat next to left in the middle of there lunch because of the service.
Easy to leave this place w/o paying which I kind of felt like doing.
Sundae we order came out super melted and all over the place.  We ate a few bites & the FHC we shared was good but not to die for that I was thinking it might be.
Maybe my expectations were to high.
Oh I put moderate pricing that is if you share... I would say more on the pricey side if your eating your own meal w/drinks.  

May try to have a FHC @ the window again but will definitely not be dining at this restaurant again, ever! 
~With so many other places in Vegas there is no reason to have bad service twice.Over priced and over hyped...  Sliders were dry. Frozen hot chocolate could be had somewhere else for half the price with better quality.  For the prices they are charging, you figure they would at least try to serve you quality goods.Mediocre food for the time I waited. I saw 5 tables who sat down after us get their food before us. It took them over 40 minutes to bring us our food. Food wasn't even made to how I ordered it. We spent almost 2 and a half hours there. They should have just comped our meal. They even got our check wrong which we caughht before paying.  On the plus side, the fries were crispy.MEH. I wouldn't come back here for the food, it was generally mediocre.

I think the draw is the location (right on the strip) and the size of the portions (insanely huge). Maybe if I was hungover I would have been more excited. The mojito was the highlight of the meal. Maybe if I tried the frozen hot chocolate I would be more impressed. That seems to be the hit here.burger was pretty good but not worth $15.  Bathroom is outside the restaurant and around the corner (odd).  Just wasnt impressed overall.How can something be so overrated. Just came here for dessert to try out the much talked about frozen hot chocolate. Ordered the double frozen hot chocolate for two which was $15 and upon its arrival, I was immediately disappointed. How can people rave so much about shaved ice, hot chocolate powder, and whipped cream? Is it because they're on the Vegas Strip and they know people will come and pay $11 and up for something so simple. I'd rather have some cold stone or baskin and Robins ice cream. I don't know what the food is like, but if you're intrigued about this frozen hot chocolate dessert and you're so eager to try it like I was, Go Somewhere else.Mortons & Ruth's chris aRe the same price and 5x better.

The meatball lolipop is s waste of $14.   My  GF'S filet was not good at all and tasted like rubber.  I had the ribeye and it was prety good.    The mash potatoes are the best thing they good but a small portion.

My diet coke tasted like sewer water.    Yes pure caca.    

O wait we did have a $50 coupon that helped but it was still $100 for two after the discount.

Service was just "ok".In high school, I used to come here at least once a week with my friends after school. Not only was the food amazing but the service was spot on. However, I've been in here three times recently with a friend, and the service was incredibly slow. There were only two of us and it wasn't busy, so there is no reason why we should have had to wait 20 minutes for our food and several minutes for someone to take our drink order. The wings are good, but not good enough to make up for the fact that their service is horrible. If you have a hankerin' for BWW, the Las Vegas Boulevard location is worth the little extra drive as you will not spend several minutes waiting just to get a refill on your drink like you would here.I'm from Hawaii and as such, please take my opinion with a grain of salt unless you as well are picky and spoiled when it comes to Hawaiian barbeque.

I've been to three places for Hawaiian bbq while in Arizona, and Ono Hawaiian is definitely the worst of them.  The fact that is it a chain first raised red flags, although I knew this fact when I decided to come.

I ordered then curry chicken katsu and I was horribly disappointed.  The curry was more like water-with-curry-flavoring.  It was watery and instead of adding flavor, like curry is supposed to, it made my rice mushy and my katsu soggy.

If you want good Hawaiian BBQ, go to Aloha Kitchen, run by a local Hawaiian family, in Mesa.  It's a drive if you're close to Ono Hawaiian, but it's absolutely worth it and reminds me of being back in the Islands.I am (almost) embarrassed to admit this, but I purchased an apple fritter and coffee for my wife at the in-house Dunkin Donuts.  As expected, the coffee was very good and the fritter sucked.  The one and only plus is it is convenient if you are staying at Sam's Town.I was near this part of town a while back and was wanting a nice little breakfast.  I saw this places was rated pretty high on yelp and figured I'd give it a go.  It looks pretty much just like any and every other coffee shop you've been into.  This nothing out of the ordinary about the looks, which if you are going for a coffee shop that's probably a good thing.  I ended up getting a double espresso and a slice of the quiche.  The quiche was heated up in the microwave and the coffee was served.  The food looked amazing but was far to under seasoned.  I guess they thought that the Parmesan cheese on top would be enough to season the entire thing, but they were really underestimating that.  The coffee was good, it's pretty hard to mess up an espresso.  

I didn't rate it very good, but would I go back?  I think so.  I might give them another try, and get something other than the quiche.  Their baked good looked pretty good and their price wasn't crazy or anything.  If I'm in this area again I will probably stop by and they may make me change my review.  I'll keep my fingers crossed.I went here for a Birthday party and I was not really impressed. They have an arcade for the kids in the main entrance.  That can be good and bad. I went up to the bar and I started to gamble and I literally had to wait 10 minutes to get offered a drink. Bartenders were too busy talking to other employees or using their phones. The party was upstairs in the balcony area. In my opinion, drunk people and steep ass stairs do not mix well together. The idea is nice but I am not sure about trekking down those stairs after a couple of beers. As for service; I was not really satisfied. Maybe it was because the waitress never came back to take our food order. Maybe it was for the best because when I looked at the menu it was waaay overpriced for what seems to be your typical bar food flair. Two and a half stars - rounded down to two.I haven't been here in about a year and boy have things changed. This place used to be packed for lunch but today it's empty. Maybe it's bc of the sign that says at the register " Greek patio is not a fast food business fresh food takes time and your patience is appreciated". Not a good way to start off your customer service plus the lady at the register wasn't very friendly. Now to the food this place used to have an awesome gyro sandwich but mine today was bad. The pita wasn't fresh half of my meat was dried out and looked burnt and the sauce is not what I remembered. With all the other Greek options in the area I will not be back.Ugh...for the food you order it is simply overpriced.  I think room service had similar pricing.  If I knew that I would have just stayed upstairs.  Service was ok.  A little slow.  It looked like the staff was on edge a little (maybe from all the bad reviews/issues)  If the menu changes or pricing gets better, I'll give it another try...otherwise I'll just walk across the streetThe food is average, the service is average, but the super high cost for what you get makes it below average. 

I have been there on multiple occasions because I play in the Aria poker room and this is open 24 hours, and every time I leave I say, "never again." HahaTotally not worth it for $30.  This is probably the saddest buffet i've been to in Vegas and it's such a shame because the resort looks so nice! 

Came on a Sunday night. No line.  Restaurant was not full.  Hostess sat us as far away from the buffet as possible! Geez! we had to walk what felt like a block or two before reaching the food.

You know you're in for a disappointment when you ask what the buffet is known for and the hostess says "well we have crab legs".  Errr...ok i hardly think that is something worth highlighting.  The crab legs were just ok.  A little too squishy and hard to get out of the shell.  The selection of the food was minimal.  Several cuts of meat, some mediteranean, create your own pasta, salads...really nothing spectacular.  The only dish my husband kept going back for was the spicy potatoes.

Overrall was a waste of money and my friends and I left stuffed but not satisfied.  We just ate to get our money's worth.  Boo.Short end of it: Save your money/calories/time!

I decided to use up some of my resort credit on this place and the only positive thing that I can say is that I was definitely not hungry after.

First of all, I am a huge crab fan. I can sit for hours eating crab. However, Aria, much like other buffet places on the strip, have found a way to totally ruin the crab experience for me. How? They cut the crab legs in half! Now some of you are probably thinking, "this makes it easier to eat". For a crab eating veteran, all this does is to frustrate me. Over the years, I have honed my skillz at cracking, pulling out the 'crab tendons' and then freeing huge chunks of crab that provide a great melt in your mouth feeling experience. When the crab is cut in half, the tendon is still in there and you have to scrape it off. The result is shredded crab. In addition, since they were sliced in this fashion, the meat tends to dry out....but you didn't start reading this review about my pet peeves of buffet crab, you want to know about the Aria Buffet.

The buffet is not as pretty looking as some of the other high end buffets on the strip. Someone else had mentioned cafeteria feeling, and they are right. The intent was supposed to be a high end feel, but it ended up feeling sterile, like hospital sterile.

The food was a mixed bag of foods from all over the world. Asian, Mexican, Indian (they have a tandoor oven), American.....along with some cut cheeses and meats. All the food was executed poorly. The brisket was shoe leather tough. I come from brisket country and I know that the brisket presented there was several hours undercooked. The prime rib was tender, but not very flavorful. I also would have preferred it to be more on the rare side. You already know my stance on the crab legs. The tandori chicken was forgettable (bad thing for Indian food). The desserts were pretty poor too (I will give them a pass on the ice cream/gelato/sorbet)

The whole experience made me think about the buffets on cruise ships. Cruise ship buffets can be hit or miss, but there is always something tasty to eat. I once read that the food budget for one of the mass market cruise lines is around $7 per person per day (pastries, breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Considering I just forked over $35 for this meal, I was even more depressed (I know it was resort credit, but I could have eaten at another venue for that credit).

Don't get me started on the service. All I can say is that I felt like I was an annoyance to the server. Cmon people, smiles are free and they go a long way!

Not the worst strip buffet (that goes to the Riviera), but not too far off.

So...if you are thinking about it...don't. If you absolutely need to do a buffet, try somewhere else. This is an expensive way to feel not hungry!stumbling in at around 2am - it's one of the few places to eat late night at Aria without having to leave the casino. we were warmly greeted at the door and quickly sat as they were closing in about an hour or so. there was about 4 other tables already dining. 
upon being sat - we flipped thru the menu - everything sounded good and reasonably priced (except for a few lobster dished running well over $100). 10 minutes had now passed and we haven't been acknowledged or asked if we were ready or needed water. my buddy began to dose off - as i attempted to wave someone down but there was only two chinese guys cleaning the same table on the other side of the restaurant. another 10 minutes passed before a waiter walked by only to clean the table next to us before i was able to get his attention to take our order.

we ordered seafood stir fry, seasame chicken, wonton noodle soup and crispy chicken wings. food was brought out as they came and so was two glasses of water.
call me fickle - BUT - for a fine establishment at Aria - i would have expected to either be asked - and if not - appetizer being brought out before anything else. futhermore - i shouldn't have to ask for more water multiple times, esp when there was only two tables left. when i'm at a fancy restaurant - attention to detail is a must!
i only ate the wonton and chicken wings (as that was my order) - the chicken wings were good. great crispy texture and juicy meat - tasted even better with the thai chili sauce it came with.
the wonton noodle soup on the other hand was nothing to rave about. very sub par. borderline bland.
mid way thru eating - the check was dropped off and asked if we can pay right away as the cashier is going to go home. so not only did we have to wait for their services - we had to rush ourselves. 
not impressed by any means.This place really isn't any better than subway. But, it is more expensive. The food is mediocre at best. It had very little flavor (I got the chipotle chicken cheesesteak) and was made with some nasty processed chicken-ish stuff. Gross. Absolutely nothing special about this overpriced subway with no spinach. They also had signs on their windows - one for wraps and one for $3.99 foot-long subs on Sundays with the purchase of a drink. Well, they didn't have ANY wraps and the sub deal only applied to SOME subs. Complete crap. 

I gave it 2 stars instead of one because the guys working there were very nice.Stopped by here with LiLy D to grab a quick bite. 

We were in a rush so I just got pho tai. The waiter doesn't come by to check to see if I'm ready to order. He doesn't come by to check to see how everything is. They charge $1.50 for tea...wtf?

Thanks for picking up the check LiLy!Hole in the wall with mediocre food would not go back!I booked Summer Bay for a 5 day 4 night stay for me and my family. In total there would be 5 of us I booked the two bedroom/two bath rental unit. Due to research/reviews we knew all about the construction so we were prepared. What we were not prepared for was the "oldness". We are owners at The Grand View and with Hilton Vacation Clubs. We wanted to check out Summer bay for comparison, since Summer bay offered ammoniates that the others don't.. i.e.. free shuttles, plentiful parking and wireless Internet. But my oh my the units look straight out of an 80's home decor magazine. The unit was not a lock out as we were accustomed to but rather just a semi larger room with two separate smallish bedrooms. A small galley style kitchen, a decent sized living room, a nice outdoor balcony and two functional bathrooms. The master bath has the BIGGEST tub I have ever seen...could easily fit 3-4 folks in it, but the hot water literally only lasted long enough to fill the tub up halfway. While the construction noise was never an issue the walls are SUPER thin and we knew EVERY time our neighbors used their dishwasher, or clothes washer, or flushed their toilet. 

Unlike a lot of reviews our check in and check process was VERY easy. We got in around 7:30pm, A nice man by the name of Chris checked us in, we had building 20 room 207 which looked out over the pool/bbq area. Our three girls used the pool every evening, but word of warning..the pool is open 24 hours a day, and when some folks get back from a long night of drinking and decided they need to take a dip YOU WILL KNOW IT... We did go to Von's the first day and picked up several food items and prepared them in the room..all the kitchen appliances are adequate. Our daughters [ages 28, 14 & 12] used the shuttle service several times and it was always on time with a personable and professional driver. 

Now for the not so nice side... My husband telecommutes for his job and this was to be a half working half playing vacation. And one of the MAIN reasons we booked with Summer Bay was for the free wireless Internet. After check in and unpacking hubby followed the directions to connect to the Internet but the phone number given was CONSTANTLY busy. During our 5 days he called the front desk more then a DOZEN times and was ALWAYS told "Yes, it is down but they are working in it and should be up real soon". Well that was COMPLETELY untrue. If we would have known we would have never booked with Summer Bay....and Yes, I realize that not everyone needs/wants the connection, but for our family it was a necessity...Hubby had to go to other retail locations to use their wireless, and he still was unable to have the 3 conference/Internet calls that were scheduled. This was a HUGE problem for us, especially since we own our own business. We even inquired about getting our money back and booking another hotel, but we had already paid in full and that was not an option. 

Secondly, while it was cooler then normal summer [fry an egg on the sidewalk] heat, our room still required use of the AC. Well, we still don't know what the issue is/was, but the AC literally would FREEZE the living room and kitchen but would NOT even drop the temperature down in the bedrooms they were constantly warm over 80 degrees and slightly muggy every night. And we even closed all the vents in every room other then the two bedrooms, but still did not wrok. Not a pleasant sleeping environment. 

Thirdly on our second day we asked for 3 extra pillows and 2 blankets...the person sleeping on the pull out sofa was freezing. After a few calls and being told "we do not have any extras" I finally had a nice gentleman deliver 1 blanket and 1 pillow...and was told "if any more become available" he would bring some by...Well that never happened. It seemed extremely odd with the amount of units at Summer Bay that there were no extras, but I guess we will never know if they really had more or not since we will never be returning under these conditions again.I was really looking for some authentic Mexican, but because of time and location had to settle. I knew better but went in anyway. The restaurant was not busy but service was a little off. My wife and I were seated at a table too small for my children. We had a craving for margaritas and shared a pitcher. It was good. Nothing else was. The salsa was bland like ketchup and we asked for an extra Jalapeno and never got it. The "Flautas" rolled in flour tortillas were corn taquitos. The Green Chile Pork Chimi was filled with flavorless stew meat and was soggy. Had we not enjoyed our margaritas we probably would have not eaten and gone to Taco Bell. This is probably a good restaurant for Snow Birds with no palate, but for true Southwesterners it was horrible.I'm noticing a pattern to the reviews here, so I need to chime in. We debated between this location and downtown (Hilldale is much closer to our house). We decided Hilldale because we have two very small children and we thought this would be easier. I must temper my review with this: you cannot go wrong with the beer or the cheese curds. And thankfully this time we had a good server (we've had bad service at this location before). Chad, thank you for being a good server. What I need to complain about is the food. Our meals were inedible. The meat was overcooked and the veggies were cold or very undercooked. My husband is rarely one to complain, but he literally had to stop eating his chicken sandwich because it was so tough he couldn't bite through it. My walleye was rubbery and my daughter's grilled chicken was extra tough, too. I am not giving a lower star review because the manager took the food off our bill and gave us tokens for free beer. We may try again, but perhaps we'll stay in the bar and stick with the beer.Do you like waffles?
Yah we like waffles!

Do you like chicken?
Yah we like chicken!

But this place was uninspiring. I just felt like I could have accomplished the same thing by getting a box of Eggos and some KFC. Didn't live up to the hype at all. The waffles were too mushy and were served to us luke warm. The chicken tasted no better than what you get from the grocery store deli.

Bon appétit!We had lunch here yesterday, March 12th.  It was very disappointing, especially for the price paid.  My husband and I each ordered 2 small plates of tapas and each had one glass of sangria.  Our lunch bill, not including the tip, was $60!!!!!  The sangria did not even have chopped fruit in it, as did every other glass of sangria I had ever purchased at other restaurants. Sixty plus dollars was an outrageous price to pay for lunch.  We will not be back.  Las Vegas has too many other places to try.  We were excited, as Barcelona is just blocks from my son's house in Southern Highlands.  He had given this restaurant a few tries.  He said he will not be back either.Relatively good gluten free section, but I wish there were more options for food allergies.  Just a larger selection in general would be nice.  As a specialty store, I would expect to see more specialty items and fewer items I'd find at a regular grocery store (like typical commercial frozen pizzas, for example).

Pepperoni with corn syrup in it...not impressed.

I can get the exact same gluten free items I'm looking for, and get it for much less money elsewhere (see Winco).

I'll still go in a pinch, but it's not my first choice.Panchero's Mexican Grill looked interesting to eat at, I love how they prepare their tortilla's in the big presser they have - but that's the only thing that impressed me; the tortilla's... Since they're freshly made, they're still yummy and "gooey" - The staff was really nice when we entered, and was attentive to what we wanted for our orders :)

I got a pretty basic burrito but was disappointed at the rice, the other two people in our party compared it to Uncle Ben's rice, the steak we got seemed "boiled", the medium salsa wasn't as spicy as I thought it was (but they do have a counter filled with different hot sauces; of course I grabbed the Tapatío), although the salsa was flavorful. My friends had ordered a chicken quesadilla - they were good but not great. It seemed they only had Montery Jack as their cheese. The prices were pretty decent, I think next time I will try something else though!The setting is awesome, the menu is solid. The service and quality were below expectations.The Advocate is not my favourite of all the pubs in Edinburgh, but if I am desperate it will do the trick. Situated just around the corner from the Royal Mile, The Advocate is just a short walk from the city centre and so it is a convenient place to reach and always seems to be a popular choice with the tourists. 

I don't have anything particular against The Advocate, its just that I have been here on several occasions and each time I haven't had the best experience. The pub is generally filled with locals, and if you go in during the afternoon, most of them are drunk and looking at you in a really sleazy way - not nice.

Most of the time the staff have been friendly, but occasionally there are some workers who completely fail to acknowledge your presence and you can be stood waiting at the bar for ages to be served. The Advocate serves above average pub food and the prices are really reasonable too. I would like to come back here for a meal again, but the drunk locals and the poor service has put off for the time being.I'd been wanting to check this place for quite some time and I finally got the chance last night (Sunday 9/8) as I was there to see an old friend off who is moving away. 

(It's 8 p.m. and fairly packed. The douche quotient is also a bit higher than I expected.) 

I was a little underwhelmed with the tap selection, especially when Tops is known for their stellar array of wonderful and varied beers, but I was nonetheless able to find something I'd been dying to try - the Lips of Faith Coconut Curry. A customer was sitting at the bar directly in front of me and overheard me mentioning to my friend that that's what I was going to order. He suggested sampling it first. While the request for a sample was met with some 'tood from the bartender, it was the right call  - not something I'd want a whole pint of. For this sample, I was punished and forced to wait 12 minutes before the bartender decided he had absolutely nothing else with which to fake being busy and he was practically forced to approach me again. This time, I ordered a Prescott Heroes 19 - sample not required. I love brown ales and this was decent enough, but also nothing special. 

At precisely 8:30, the lights dimmed, the volume on the TVs went up, and everyone except my two friends and I had shut the fuck up. I turn around to notice everyone staring up at a TV. Breaking Bad. "Oh," my friend turns to me and says, "it's one of THOSE kind of bars." Because I didn't know conversation during Breaking Bad was strictly verboten, we continued speaking, albeit in a most subdued tone. Dude sitting next to the sample-suggesting gentleman and looking like he'd be more comfortable reading comic books at home in his mommy's basement actually turned around and shushed us! He fucking shushed us!! Are you kidding me???? That was it...time to slug our beers and go elsewhere.I love seafood! So I was really looking forward to coming here. The crab dip was really quite good, but no one taste or saw any crab...just artichoke. But like I said, it was really good and we wound up ordering a second one (there was 6 of us)
Entree portions were of good size, prices were kinda big, taste was average (except with what my mom had, I think it was the tri tip? WONDERFUL!), server was uninterested/uninteresting (service itself was good. Prompt.), nothing to write home about. 
It's a more expensive, less tasty Red Lobster. But still good enough to be 2 stars. I would give it another chance. Maybe I just ordered the wrong item.Maybe they had a off day.The food here was pretty bad. The chicken in the fried rice looked like it was meat left over from other meals. I guess next time I order from here I'll try something different. If I do.Comparable pricing as city hall, but not nearly as good and portions seem to be smaller as well. Fun people watchingEverything up to the point of my wedding went well.... the ladies are very on top of the whole ordering process and very nice to deal with. I wouldn't have even written a review except I feel like they could have been a little more apologetic  about delivering my wedding cupcakes late to my reception. I had all my guests sitting watching the assembly of my cupcake tower when they were to be delivered an hour before the reception was set to start. Then I get an email notifying me that I was late making final payment but since they neglected to call me to ask for payment they were going to wave any and all late charges.... Um, if GSS had called me right after my wedding I would have paid the balance in full so I really didn't understand the email letting me know how kind they were to wave late charges that would have been their issue to begin with since they neglected to phone me to get the balance after services were rendered. It was kind of like they wanted to write me and tell me how kind they were waving the late charges when it was their fault for not calling me sooner. When I emailed them back explaining that I was disappointed with how late the cupcakes were delivered all I got was a "sorry".... "please call us as soon as possible and make final payment".... not what I expected. Cupcakes were cute and tasted pretty good, from what I was able to taste.... a little pricey but that's the trend I guess. I was disappointed in their lack of remorse over the late delivery and their annoying email about neglecting to call me for payment, I think I should have at least received some kind of a peace offering.Ok, so I show up on a Sunday night (a.k.a. Valentine's Day in most of the Western world) to grab a drink with some friends, walked in the door and was greeted by three small children running for the door. If I were drinking something at the time, would have definitely done a spit take. My thought process: Kids? Bar? Then, why wasn't I allowed to go to a bar as a 6-year old? I felt momentarily robbed.

There was definitely some kind of party going on, lots of balloons everywhere, country/western music blasting from the DJ booth. Lots of locals without a lot of teeth who got down with their bad selves on the dance floor, with a side of some Paco Paco holdovers wearing exotically printed tight dresses standing their ground. Drinks (premium) were $5.50, and were incredibly tiny. We stayed long enough to finish my miniature drink and headed out. Might give it another try when it isn't kid's birthday/Paco Paco Valentine's day/dancing toothless locals/Country/Western night. Maybe.I bought a groupon for this place because I figured I could just get some drinks with it. We got there and told the hostess we just wanted to drink so she pointed us in the direction of the outside bar...well there were no seats in the bar, so we wandered around and eventually sat ourselves at the inside bar. The BF and I got a couple of their 'signature' margaritas. They were pretty terrible. I had the prickly pear margarita and it was very strong and tasted fairly terrible. Also, they put some super spicy stuff around the rim of the cup that was really unpleasant and was not mentioned on the menu. The drinks were 12$. This was ridiculous. I would not come back here again.Whatever Mexican food and crappy service.  Go find a million better restaurants on the strip.  They also charge for the chips and salsa.  This place will be gone within the year.Ok, so I want to give Haze just one star, but I ended up somewhat enjoying the night, so I'll give it 2.

First off, Haze is not a popular club. It just isn't. Why do you think you can get wristbands for free entrance and drinks and everything just on the strip? Why do you think there are internal promoters inside the hotel that try to get you on the guestlist with just a couple hours' notice?

Anyway, so apparently the wristbands from the strip are by one promoting company and they "trump" the internal promoter's guestlist passes. They workers at the club/line can't legally tell you to take off the wristbands if you have also gotten on guestlist through their internal promoters (but those are the better bet anyway because girls get 2 free drink tickets, and guys have discounted entrance I think).

We got in, and it's tiny. I was underwhelmed but at least I didn't have high expectations like I did for Hakkasan. There's one bar and one dancefloor. It ended up being kinda fun because they play hip hop and some EDM (but not mostly edm like most clubs).Wendy's noodle house was off the beaten path..the roasted duck was too salty. Wonton noodle needed  more broth. Maybe we'd get better service if we were a local and a regular. We got the hammered chicken also, the tomato fried rice was too dried and the chicken had the juice hammered out of it..maybe it was just me. Nah the chicken was dry.Place is OK
Large menu borders on pho, soups , chow meins
-mussels in basil -ok...nothing special 
-chefs spicy chicken...ok...not spicy really...just a bunch of pepper pods
-beef chow fun...like beef stroganoff in gravy Chinese style
...looking around almost everyone was having soups so maybe that is their forte?We ordered take out from Totties 2 last night.  When we got home the rice containers were not even close to being full (3/4 full each), and the food was badly spiced.  We asked for medium, but all three dishes were hot.  The pad thai was almost inedible because there were so many peppers in it.  Aside form being spicy, the food left little to the imagination and was disappointing.  The vegetables were overcooked and bordered on being soggy and the chicken was overcooked and tough. Given the comments from diners before us, we may have just caught them on a bad night or ordered the wrong dishes, but we wasted $45 on our meals.I used to love this place and come here all the time, but new people and other changes have just really brought the quality down. Things that went wrong with my last visit:

-main issue, they used to put lots of bacon on their blt's (9 pieces...they actually told you that to assure you), but I've had a few bad ones so I first ask "do you still put lots of bacon on your blt's?" And was assured they do. I say great and order one. I got at best 2-3 pieces. I took a picture I'm going to try and attach to this review. It was a weak sandwich...but I asked before ordering and was assured there was plenty.
-two of us at the register (holding hands) and the cashier only takes my order and immediately runs off, and I have to get her attention to tell her the second order, and she runs away before I can order drinks...so I got waters instead of wine
-asked for a half cranberry croissant on wheat (instead of croissant)and soup, they can't do half a croissant...but I asked for wheat bread? So i ask for a half turkey on wheat with cranberry added. She tells me, "well that's just a cranberry croissant on wheat, which we can't do a half of"...so we just got a turkey...but when they brought it out they let us know they managed to add cranberry to it lol...
-the sandwiches come with a pickle spear. Neither of us got one. I go up and ask, they bring me one...I ask for a second one because 2 people...sigh

Still pretty good place but this is the third or fourth time in a row and it has been getting worse each time. I ordered drive through breakfast last time and got bacon egg sandwich, then before I drove away I asked if it was a bacon-egg...and she said "yup bacon egg!" And I get home and it's a bacon-sausage.

I'm not excited to come here anymore.

Paying $9 to look in a paper bag and see 3 pieces of bacon, tomato, and lettuce on sliced bread with only a banana just doesn't seem worth it.Now my favorite manicurist is gone. Now when I go they don't even greet you, they just push you to a chair as fast as they can. I realize they were always that way, except for one But sadly he is not there anymore.Everything about this place is average or slightly below average.  I came in with a large group, so I got to see a lot of the different menu items and they were all very bland.  We ordered a few platters of the Soul Sampler, which was overpriced and overcooked.  My cowboy burger had a lot of potential, but the hockey puck that came slapped in between the bun really was disappointing.  I will say they made a nice bloody mary.  I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.Been here three times and man, this place is mostly bad. First experience here: party of eight, Friday night, every other place around (despite the negative temperatures) was packed. We sat, ordered drinks, ordered food. Place was empty. Drinks kept coming and after 45 minutes, we began to ask about our food. The waitress nervously informed us "it was coming". About 15-30 minutes later, we were informed that our ticket was lost and all food would be comped. 

Second trip was St. Patty's Day -- they were advertising beer specials and corned beef and cabbage. Went to the bar to order and the exasperated waitress said "Nothing here is managed well!! It's going to take well over an hour for your food" We got Thai that night.

Third trip (what, we're gluttons for punishment!) we were overcharged from the advertised drink specials. Waitress was very nice, but not great at getting things spot on (come on, fried potatoes do not count as a salad!). Other than that, things were okay.

Food is fine -- typical mass distributor American fare, but not bad at all. Mixed drinks were weak. Waitresses have always been pretty good/fast and apologetic for their working conditions. I will go back, because I love the patio and the fact that it rarely ever seems busy, which is good when you are not looking for the typical college crowd hangout and just want a big place to order some mediocre food and have a few drinks.Does any apartment renter *actually* like their property management company?  I think it's pretty rare.  We all have gripes.  However, in 11 years of renting, I've dealt with 5 property management companies and 2 owner-landlords.  The owner-landlords were by far the worse.  Of the 5 property management companies, Urban Land Interests earns the title of the worst.

It's not that they were so bad that I moved out because of them.  It's just that their properties (I only lived in 1, but priced several) are overpriced and their management is mediocre at best.  I don't know if the person (who I won't name) who is in charge of Bel Mora is just overworked and underpaid, or is a legitimate space-case, but dealing with them was often like pulling teeth.  I had an agreement with them for my move-out inspection that I wouldn't have the apartment all cleared out, because I was leaving very early the next morning, so I needed the bed still.  This information wasn't relayed to the rude and confused kid who came by to do the inspection (who I wasn't expecting - I thought the property manager was coming by).  He didn't want to do the inspection because the apartment wasn't empty, but after explaining the situation, he agreed to walk through with me.  He had to have been high if he thought I was going to let him do it without me seeing exactly what he noted.

The maintenance crew was always really nice, and when a maintenance request was submitted, it was addressed within a day or two.  So, they get an A.

The property itself was very nice (albeit overpriced).  For what I paid for a 2BR, 2BA on the 2nd floor in Madison, I paid for a 2BR, 2BA luxury apartment on the 15th floor in Milwaukee, overlooking Lake Michigan.  

Their handling of my security deposit was suspect.  There was a carpet stain that happened a year before we moved out.  When I called the property manager after it happened, they said they could just cut out the area of carpet that was ruined and replace it, and it would be around $100.  Or, I could leave it until I moved out and it would just be taken out of my security deposit.  Well, I opted for the latter, and it ended up costing me $350!  Pretty ridiculous, especially for a carpet that was complete crap when I moved in 2.5 years prior.  

Just another way to milk me for more money.

Overall, I don't suggest renting a property from Urban Land Interests.  It's a pretty tough market in Madison, because most landlords take advantage of renters because, well, they can with all the students.  I'd still suggest properties run by other management companies.I have very rarely used this pharmacy without them screwing something up.  Repeatedly, they have failed to notify me about some kind of hold-up with my prescription until I've arrived to pick it up, resulting in either an extremely long wait or a return trip on my part.  Most memorably, I had to wait for over 30 minutes to fill a pain killer prescription while I had a splitting headache--and the store was quite sparsely populated at the time.Excellent service, mixed paella totally uninteresting for 50 bucks and luke warm.  Ate here before, pretty much the same mediocre and overpriced food.

Gotta love Vegas, they don't get better just pricier.Umm.  What are these "hippies" smoking?

I only ask because:
a) this isn't a 60s-ish place.  Just because you calling your appetizers "munchies" (I get it!  Like I'm stoned!) and you have a psychadelic menu cover doth not make a hippie place.    This was like the bastard lovechild of TGI Friday's and a 5 and Diner.
b) This is some of the heaviest pizza I've ever had.  And not in a good way (like traditional Chicago pie).  You'd better like crust because you get a ton of it.  We did a cheese and a BBQ chicken. 
c) Tomato bisque soup is not bisquey.  My wife thought it tasted like tomato sauce.  When she sent it back, the server guessed right "Did you think it tasted like red sauce?"  Apparently we weren't the first.  That ain't a good sign, friends.
d) It isn't cheap.  You want good, cheap hippie food?  Go to Two Hippies Beach Stand @ 5th and Camelback.
e) Where's the peace on Earth?  It is loud.  We got sat in the back (near the kitchen) which was better.. but up front?   Find me an eating experience where loud helps your experience.  I never notice the noise levels in restaurants.  This was madness.

On the plus side, there are a lot of beers.  They are expensive but it looks like a great deal at happy hour (which is 2-6 M-F).  

Northsiders, don't let the convenience trick yourselves into thinking this is good pizza.  You're better than this!Want so bad to give this place a good review but I can't because if awful service. I agree about the good beer selection and food, but these people are so desperate to leave early that the waitress had to inform us 3 times that the kitchen closes in 20 mins. This all before saying hello.The only reason I came here was because I was staying at Aria and it was convenient. Sometimes you are surprised in a good way and this wasnt one of them. Mediocre bartenders who just had no concept of who was at their bar first. We were constantly ignored and told to wait.

This place is a circus full of clowns and it isnt a lounge. This is like a supermarket deli with loud music and a crappy bar.This place is not cool! Went there on Aria's opening weekend, so wanted to cut a little slack, but no, not even opening weekend jitters were an excuse for this place. Hubby and I weren't looking for a club, just a cool place to hang out and get a couple of drinks. Well, drinks were about $20 - $30 each. We were told to sit at the very large, circular seating area. We said we'd gladly take a smaller spot so they could seat a larger party looking for bottle service. They said don't worry about it. Soooo, after a few more $30 drinks each, we were kicked out to a smaller table due to bottle service. Not a huge deal. When they moved us, we asked again to go to a small table of two so we could hang out and enjoy, they showed us to another larger table and told us no one would be coming for two hours, so we should just enjoy our time. We ordered more drinks. Twenty minutes later we were kicked out again due to a group coming for bottle service. At this point there weren't any other seats left. After paying our $200+ tab for two, we left, vowing to never come back again! Bad service and attitude!As much as I wanted to like this place, I just can't I've it 3 stars. Honestly I HAD to compare it to Postino's since 1. In my eyes they have the BEST bruachetta and atmosphere and 2. I heard the living room copied their style, and unfortunately it's a bad copy. They did get the atmosphere/ambience right. However the bruchetta not so much.

We tried the steak, tomato and apple fig. The apple fig was delisous, but u can't really go wrong with that receipe. Been there done that. The tomato was a disappointment. Seems like they tried to do their own unique take on the original and for me it just didn't work. The steak was ok, unique yes. But I could live without it.there's this commercial. order a medium or larger drink and get an egg and cheese english muffin for $.99. seemed like a good deal to me, and i was hungry this morning. besides, dunkin' has been making great strides in quality and service, right? that's what the marketing would have you believe anyway. so i order from the drive thru and pay $3.15 for a medium iced coffee and the aforementioned egg and cheese english muffin. service is swift. i drive away, ready to dig into my sandwich on the parking lot that is the 101. that's when things get ugly. my sandwich is cold. like, you can feel how cold it is through the paper bag. i can't eat it, mainly because i'm afraid it will sicken me in some way ... i don't screw around with egg. and yes, i'm still hungry. 

so, sorry dunkin', your marketing gal is a genius, but this store did not deliver. shame on me for believing that silly marketing ploy.This place is just like any other club, and what I think is that it all depends on what you make of it...overpriced drinks...and the big negative was the way I know that they set up ratio. Shady ass fck! I had good ratio with me and they set it up where guys get left behind, not just with my crew but with all others to promote dudes to get bottle service... I bribed the dbag behind the chord to just let us in right away, cover is 30$ on that weekend, an average weekend, and the decor is ok, nothing that was really amazing, dance floor was actually pretty small, pretty much a little smaller than haze's dance floor. It's average at best...[This review is based on two meals, dinner last year and brunch last week.]

Meal 1: Dinner

I've stepped into Coopers a few times hoping to have a beer with some colleagues but it's always been so crowded that we've gone elsewhere.  Finally went for dinner tonight with my wife and was quite disappointed.  

As many other reviewers have mentioned, Coopers has a horrible layout and always feels cramped, so we decided to sit outside, even though it was unseasonably chilly.

Service: Ok.  The waitress was very nice, though she forgot to bring us water the first time we asked for it.  She also didn't tell us the specials (although the host had when we were looking at the menu and deciding whether or not to dine there, so perhaps he told her that ) but ultimately she redeemed herself (more on that later.)

Drinks: My wife and I both ordered a mojito, even though it was pretty cold out.  Big mistake, and not just because of the weather.  The drinks were watery and the mint was wilting and brownish which made it seem like a large glass of rotting leaves.  But booze is booze and I could have overlooked this.

Menu: Coopers has what looks to be an incredible menu.  There were a number of items that sounded really good and I was already plotting my return voyage while I was making my choice.  But alas...

Appetizer: About four months ago I tried bone marrow for the first time at Graze and was absolutely blown away.  It was rich, decadent, and seemed to hold the very essence of beef in its silky embrace.  I don't know if Graze is just buying much better marrow bones or if their doing something in the preparation, but the marrow at Coopers was nothing like what I had at Graze.  It was flavorless and fatty, difficult to scoop out of the bone and disturbingly pink at points.  It came with only four small pieces of bread, so you had to slather an enormous amount on each one (which, by the way, so many restaurants do and i don't know why... bread is cheap.)

Speaking of bread-- I appreciated that the waitress warned us that the appetizer would take 20 minutes to prepare (although I wonder why this isn't written on the menu).  I would have appreciated it even more if she would have offered us some bread or something to munch on while we drained our watery mojitos.  As it turned out, Coopers has some really good baguettes.  In any case, all that is a minor complaint compared to...

The Entrees:

1. Pork Belly Mac and Cheese-
I ordered this one, and kind of liked the first bite.  But after two or three bites I just couldn't go in-- it was overwhelmingly sweet.  The pork belly sweetness would have been a good thing if it was offset by the sharpness of the cheddar.  But its not.  In fact, I'm not even sure that this was cheddar at all, though the menu claimed it was.  It tasted like the sweet ricotta filling that you get in a cannoli.  When my wife tried it she had the exact same experience.  She proclaimed the first bite to be "delicious," then put down her fork after two more, gagging on the sweetness.   

2. Beef Stew on "Dumplings"
My wife ordered this.  It was terrible.  Really, really terrible.  A thin layer of spaetzle is not what I (or anyone) would expect by "dumplings."  The beef looked like poop and didn't taste much better.

The Resolution:
The waitress came to the table when we had both eaten about 20% of our meal.  We said that we were finished and she asked if we would like our food wrapped up.  When we said no, she said that must be because we were so full.  No, I said.  The food just wasn't good.  She comped us for the entrees which was the right thing to do.

MEAL #2: Brunch

My parents were in town and we were looking for  a place to grab brunch before we left.  Again, everything on the menu looked really good.  Again, it really wasn't.  I ordered eggs benedict.  I don't know how you could possibly make a hollandaise sauce that ins't tasty, but Coopers managed it.  The corn beef hash my dad ordered was also just bizarre-- it looked like little shreds of corn beef and was garnished, rather bizarrely, with fruit.

The waiter was really fantastic and the atmosphere was nice, but once again the flavors just weren't there.

I highly doubt we'll be going back.Ordered the Hot n Ready Pepperoni Pizza.  It was not very good;  the pizza seemed to have been sitting in the warming oven for quite a while since the pizza was only lukewarm.  It wasn't piping hot like the ones we are usually used to getting in Henderson NV.  Service was very nice.From start to finish:

We waited for 1.5 hours to check in. Really?!? There were 4 or 5 people working at the front desk with a Disneyland-like line through the lobby and down the hall. When we finally got to the front desk, the guy working behind it had no idea what he was doing. We could tell he was flustered, but c'mon. No matter how flustered you are, when people are paying $$$$, at least ACT like you know what you're doing. He handed us our keys and tried to send us on our way... without telling us our room number?! We asked what our room number was and he told us - didn't write it down or anything. Just said the numbers and tried to send us on our way again. We asked him if he could write it down so he gave us a scrap piece of paper with our room number written on it. Thanks, man. The entire check-in process at this place needs a complete makeover. Maybe they should look into having a few more people working at the prime check-in time on a Friday night.

We walk into our 2 bedroom suite - AMAZING. Incredible views, fabulous decor, huge yummy king size beds, 2 couches with pullout queen beds (4 beds total), rain showers, a huge hot-tub/jetted tub in the master suite, TV's everywhere (in the bathroom too!), a projector in the living room with a great sound system, automated shades. I can't say enough about how fabulous our room was. 

We got room service for dinner... I've had better, but it wasn't terrible. 

When we got home from our night out, we discovered that with 2 queen pullout beds, there were no linens to go along with them. Anywhere. We thought we were missing something... that maybe they were in a secret compartment we couldn't find?! We gave up and called down to order more linens - an HOUR later they arrived.

We got room service for breakfast - the best part about the breakfast was the man who delivered it. We ordered Bloody Mary's and he made them for us like a pro bartender. His personality was great. This is the only person working at PH that deserves a good review.

We left quite a mess after breakfast, so I left housekeeping a big tip along with a nice note. They did a great job cleaning our room, but they took all of our dirty towels and didn't leave new ones. Not cool!! 

After all of these bad experiences with the hotel staff, we tried our hardest not to interact with them for the rest of the trip. However, when we woke up Sunday morning, the day of our departure, we called down to the front desk to see when checkout was. The lady said 11am, and we asked for a later checkout since we had a later-ish flight. She said sure and gave us a check-out time of 12pm. At 11:15am we called to make sure there were not outstanding charges on our bill (we paid all of our room service bills with cash). The lady was upset and told us our checkout time was 11am and there was nothing in the computer allowing us a later checkout. Oh man. 

Get it together, PH. The rooms are incredible, but the staff is all over the place, in a very bad way. This place has so much potential. All we could do at the end of the day was laugh about how bad the service was. Even though the room was one of the best I've had in Vegas, I'll never stay here again. That much money can be better spend on a different incredible room in Vegas - there are many too many to choose from!My friends & I have been to the San Diego location & have been raving about Hash House A Go Go ever since.

Unfortunately, the Las Vegas (Quad) location sucked. It was pretty boring. Staff seemed rather blah. You would think that being in Vegas the staff would be more lively. 

When we got there we sat for almost a good 20 minutes before anyone approached our table. The only saving grace was that our waiter who was an older gentleman was super nice. Other than that..this place is boring & even the food isn't the same. What a shame! San Diego location is MUCH BETTER.Guess the food is better when you eat in?

Stayed at the Rio with my family and my dog so someone had to stay behind with the pup while everyone else procured breakfast. This seems to be the only real breakfast place in the hotel/casino so options were pretty limited.... kind of like the menu.

 If you want fried chicken, bacon waffles, bloody Marys garnished with a deconstructed sandwich, etc, then 4  stars are probably well deserved.

My parents ordered the basic breakfast (one with scrambled eggs the other with over easy, both with sausages) and I ordered the sun dried tomato, goat cheese, & basil scramble with an extra side of chicken sausage.

In all honesty, I was starving so didn't realize a the stuff I missed until we got our to go order to the room.  First of all, all our orders were supposed to come with biscuits and fruit and we received a total of 1 biscuit and no fruit.  Second of all, I didn't even mind that there weren't enough biscuits because the giant hockey puck they tried to pass off as a biscuit was a dense mass that tasted like it was made yesterday.

We all chose fried potatoes which looked sad and possibly prepared at the same time the biscuit was made.  I didn't eat mine but my dog seemed to like it.

Also I'm pretty sure (receipt confirmed it) that my chicken sausage (which they do admit is in a pork casing) was actually pork sausage and was a little over seasoned for my tastes.

Lastly, the eggs. Had such high hopes for these. The scrambled eggs were either not seasoned and or not eggs? They were dense and oddly textured saved only a little by the sundried tomatoes, scant amount of fresh basil, and few crumbles of goat cheese.  Full disclosure, my dog wouldn't eat the eggs unless it had been touching sausage or had some cheese attached. 
Overall our breakfast was disappointing. Other than the forgotten items though the service was fantastic (hence the 2 stars rather than 1). All the staff members were so friendly and nice! The place was well decorated and very clean.

If they can get the kitchen sorted out I may consider eating here again but this place is definitely out of rotation on any future Vegas trips - even if we stay at the Rio again.This might be the scariest long john silvers on the planet. Its right next to a sleezy check cashing place, so there are a ton of interesting people in the parking lot. The manager was super cool and hooked us up with a bunch of hats for our pirate party.Hi. We got picked up late by one bus driver, which took us to the airbridge Office Depot. We had to wait there inside the bus for over 20 minutes waiting to be registered and assigned a different bus. We ended up transferring buses three times and the third bus was in pretty bad condition.I was here once before and did not like the service. This time I was helped as soon as I walked in. I was in and I was out.The teacher my daughter had when she first enrolled here was great. That was in 3rd grade.  My daughter is now in 5th grade and we have had issues with the last two teachers. 
   They may be college educated, but they were both first year teachers. My daughter has ADD and requires a strict teacher with experience.  What she has had are teachers who don't seem to care or who are overwhelmed with teaching their own class for the first time.
   My next step is to meet with the principal and discuss my concerns. Legacy has a good reputation as a whole, but this campus seems to be headed down hill.What happened?!  I know I haven't been to Jamba Juice in a while, but the cups got smaller, prices got bigger and the 'original' recipes vanished.  Shame on you!  I don't think I am ever coming back again.Beautiful place, very expensive and they duped me on my lease. Pleasant at first but then it went downhill.A wallmart is a wallmart just this one is one of thoes messier and less orginized ones.In a two day span, I frequented this monument to lard, not once, but twice; making Federico's my defunct dinner for two days in a row.
How did this happen? Why did this happen?
These were questions I woefully pondered as I spent nearly 3/4 of a sunday perched upon the porcelain throne, evacuating my bowels like Anderson Cooper and his news crew amidst a chaotic Tahrir square. 
The only reason to my madness, that I could fathom, in the clouded and reeking haze I was brewing that sabbath day, was that I had literally drank or smoked myself retarded- so much so that my ravenous appetite overwhelmed my better judgement.
Friday night, my mistake was assuming that the graveyard shift would care enough to properly cook an Adobada burrito at 2 am. It honestly tasted like they doused some chorizo in red chili sauce wrapped it in a tortilla and threw it out the delivery window like an unwanted baby in bath water.
Saturday night for one idiot reason or another I ordered a green chili burrito, which I'd assumed would be hard to fuck up, apparently not. This didnt taste like green chili pork, perhaps It'd be more apt to label it as "boiled pork offal with a splash of tomatillo salsa" it was proabably the worst green chili i've had in a long while.
Sunday, Montezuma claimed his bloody revenge on this descendant of Spanish immigrants (had this angry aztec spirit bothered to scan my family lineage on ancestry.com he'd have realized that the spanish on my mothers side is hardly large enough to exact vengeance for atrocities committed by cortez and his cronies in the 16th century, but who am I to question undead central american monarchs) ahem. Lets just say I dont enjoy prolonged bathroom visits and this is what Federico's translates to in my vernacular.Here's a disclaimer: I usually just use the automated wash here since it's good, cheap and I only stay for the minimum time possible.  But it's around the corner from my house so it's become the default place to go.

Prices: It's a typical wash your own car wash in Phoenix. Uses quarters.

Safety: Not really. This is one of the few places in America that I wish I had a concealed weapons permit and I was packing heat.  A couple of years ago  I arrived 30 seconds after an armed car jacking.  Since then I've been more aware of my surrounding and become more wary of some of the other clientelle.  Lots of angry men who are head over heels in love with their below average, but shiny-wheeled cars.

Overall: Use the automated car wash they've installed in the north bay. It's good value. But don't stay longer than necessary.I had heard some good things about this place for sometime and wanted to try it out. My girlfriend and I went here on a Wednesday night. The ambience is nice when you walk in. Has a nice water feature in the middle of the restaurant. We noticed the place was absolutely dead. There was one other couple there at 8pm. We wondered why it was so empty. We would find out once we started eating. We started with the sugar cane shrimp which was pretty good. It was unique. For entrees we ordered Pad Thai and Pad Panang Neau Gai. The entrees were just horrible! I love Pad Thai and eat it any chance I get. Their version of Pad Thai had some horrific flavoring, honestly tasted like Chef Boy R De sauce was used. The Pad Panang dish was just a trainwreck! It had chicken, peppers, coconut milk sauce and some kind of spice..It seriously tasted like the smell of dish detergent. My girlfriend and I love Thai food, but this had to be one of the worst meals we both have ever had. The server didn't seem to care although she did take the trainwreck dish off our bill. We left as soon as we could. No wonder why this place was empty.Possibly the worst service I've had at a valley restaurant in years. The manager must be trying to save money on the electric bill this week as the indoor ambient temp is a very uncomfortable 87 degrees tonight. Wings were decent enough to earn two stars. Probably won't be back to this Chandler mall location againLife isn't perfect. It takes time for a hotel (or any other business) to hit its stride and figure things out. But at what point do a few mistakes cross over into incompetence? Try as I might, I just can't think highly of The Cosmopolitan. The staff are uniformly delightful people and claim to be very concerned about customer service. And I do think the concern is there - just not the execution. Various things in the room were broken and took forever to get fixed. It was our last night in Vegas and we lost at least 4 hours waiting around for staff to come fix things, waiting for them to work out the bugs in the check-in process, and waiting for our waiter to bring the dishes he forgot. Brilliant - just how I wanted to spend my evening. Then the phones weren't working so we had no way of calling the concierge. The TV remotes didn't work properly either. The building is gorgeous and the amenities are excellent, but until things start to run smoothly, it's just not worth it.Not worth the money.  Very rude staff who act like you are imposing on them.  Extremely noisy hotel, especially at night.  They have a band playing at the hotel pool until 5:00 AM.  I called and asked if they can turn it down and they offered me "ear plugs."  Food is meh! Hotel stinks of stale cigarettes. Rooms were clean and we only had to stay two nights, thus, two stars.Three huge buildings and three tents with only about 15% occupancy. Mostly home furnishings. But cool ideas.
They have a very long way to go to reach the same status as the Dallas World Market or Denver World Marketplace.I've been going to this Starbucks for years and have never had a complaint until now. I ordered the vanilla machaito, but I wanted it blended. The girl told me that I couldn't have it that way. Ummm, why not? There's a sign right behind you that says, "Make It You Way", or something like that. So why couldn't I get a blended vanilla machaito? I don't know if the girl was just being lazy or what, and I was on my way to work so I didn't bother to argue this out with her. Instead I ordered a vanilla bean frap with two shots.  I finally got it, after more than five minutes of waiting when there was only one person before me.  I tasted it as I walked out and it was disgustingly sweet.  Too sweet. So not only was I disappointed for the second during this visit, now I'm just annoyed by the whole experience overall. I'm hoping my next visit will be better. I'm giving them one more shot before I head down to the one at Ft Apache and Trop instead.I went to this location today to try and use the western union there. Never had to before, but, my family is in Jamaica and that was the only way to do that at this time as a favour. Its funny to me because I also shop here from time to time and have never noticed it. I had such a horrible experience, first of all, the girl told me she could not give me the funds, because the person who sent it would have to put my name on it the way my ID lists it, which would make sense if my last name was completely different. But having my middle name on my ID proved to be too much of a challenge. So instead of Sasha Gordon, my ID has Sasha Leigh Gordon, I had all the information, the senders name, the access code, and had it not been for my fam bam asking me to buy something before I leave on my trip WEDNESDAY I could have been fine. I asked for the manager, to which the attendant yelled to the manager to come talk to this girl.
I am not a girl. I am a woman and respect me as such.
The manager comes over and points out that I work at a bank and I should understand, to which I said no... because if someone were to come in and cash a check... and it is made out to the first and last name, and the ID has a middle name, I do not require that middle name to be there, he then directed me to one across the street and insisted I go there. 
Now tell me, when I asked him why and wouldn't it be same, what do you think think his response was? He said they would say they same thing. Then why recommend that? hmm... I don't know. Lets skip on over and see. 

I went.
I got my money.


I don't work hard to be treated like a criminal. Perhaps they don't care, but that was unjust. 

Take care, I pray no one treats you like that.


P.S. When I asked the girl at the other location why they would respond like that, she couldn't answer and recommend I call Western Union, but I think its more directed to the manager and the fine young lady that got fed up with my situation before they listened.

HAPPY MONDAY!!!

Oh the market... its cool, like I said I shop there sometimes, but that was the staff... NOT going to deal with that again.I'm sorry but I'm never coming back to this particular Cici's pizza location. The salad and pizza are completely dry. They look and not to mention tasted, like they've been out for decades. Even the babies didn't like it. The customer service was great. They were very friendly but they really just need to work on the freshness of the pizza, salad and pasta. Thanks for the food but no thanks. You get what you pay for I guess. Good luck.In general, CVS is okay.  I have to say that this particular one has tried to sell my wife the generic brand of drugs, and when we ask for the name brand, they mis-quoted and said that it cost $600, even though if you go on their website under Caremark, it's like $80.  I find that a little dishonest.

The lines and drive-thru lines are usually pretty long here and the prices are fairly over-priced for regular items.  The PTs and PharmD are okay outside of the above issue.  Kind of wrong when Caremark is actually their prescription insurance company.

Oh... one other thing.  They (Caremark) dislike babies.  Yes, that's what you heard.   Apparently newborns are not given the 30 days float period like other regular health insurance.   If you pick up anything for a newborn, make sure you get that insurance card in.  Otherwise, you could be paying out your nose in cash.  They'll send you a reimbursement form, but I mean... really?  Getting reimbursed when you're worrying about a new child?  Pulease.I went here on a Thursday afternoon when it wasn't really busy and the vibe I got from the employees was that they really disliked their job. I have been here numerous times and its the same thing every time. I also got sick from the food this time which prompted me to write about it. I think I will try avoiding this place from now on.I have been practicing Bikram yoga for 7 year and have traveled to many studios around the country. I have not been to this studio for a few years as I do not live in LV. It is a nice clean and friendly studio but do not think I will be going back due to how hot the floor is. I love the heat of a studio and that is what i love about this yoga, but have never been to a studio that has this type of heating system. They must have radiant heat in the floors. In the standing poses my feet were literally burning through my towel and mat. . Laying on the floor the tops of my feet felt like they were burning and that was through my towel and mat again.  When you have your arms out for airplane it was very uncomfortable. It is unbearably uncomfortable so will most likely not return.Lordy, they try hard here. I adore them for that. The service was attentive and friendly.

But sadly, this is a mediocre steak house. A little better than Binion's, which has gone downhill since the casino was sold, but compared to the vast selection of other carnivore feeding-troughs in town, this is only a few dozen notches above a Sizzler. I mean where's the damn kobe?

My medium rare ribeye was delivered medium. The steak fries, which I asked them to double-fry, were the best thing of the night. The wines by the glass were few, and uninspired.

As I continue to do my tour of the steakhouses in Las Vegas with the goal of definitively finding the top 5, this one is not even in the running.Well, so sad, but I must write an update....
The last two times I've been in, it was lame.  I hope they aren't getting lackadaisical
since they are busy the majority of the time. 

The girl that I had, kept burping and was leaning against the wall and then was falling asleep. OYE!! Are you freaking kidding me????

I might reconsider going back :/It's Roberto's, but noticeably worse. 

This is the only Roberto's that I have been to that is in a petro station. Sure, in other regions of the country that is normal, but the service is clearly slower here and the end product is significantly worse. If you can drive to another location, do so. There is a full-sized Roberto's on the WalMart-anchored stripmall on Cheyenne/Rainbow, although that one is not as fast as other locations either. 

Maybe it is just the NW. 

I have had the chicken burrito with rice/beans and perhaps the rolled tacos with guac. There is no condiment bar. It is really a piss-poor Roberto's, to be honest. Basically take-out exclusive since there are like two or three little round tables that most obese people that would patronise an establishment like this would tip over when they leaned their fat elbows on them. You've been warned. - EWe used a groupon to eat at Hussongs. and the service was great. But the food was not. The chips are really bad. And the food tasted like something out of a box. If you are not familiar with Mexican food you'll probably be fine eating here, but if you like good Mexican food, this is not your placeI give Stingray two stars purely for the fact there food is cheap and edible during happy hour.  Service was bad (which seems to be the trend in their reviews) nothing special about their menu and very little to chose from. We were craving toro but they were out. I'd have to say their sushi was worse than RA. I'll most likely never go back unless with a group. Limited selection, poor service, long wait time and over priced drinks.  The end.***This Marriott definitely feels dated and it is not in Downtown Madison; it is a comfortable enough hotel, service is good and room rates are reasonable; however, the hotel has kind of a depressing look and feel to it; it needs an update***

This Marriott kind of feels like an airport hotel.  Airport hotels tend to be very outdated and there is typically little incentive to do a renovation because the hotel has a steady stream of customers due to its proximity to the airport and convenience of airport shuttle transportation.  This Marriott has a similar look as the Philadelphia Airport Renaissance.  Both hotels feature an open atrium that goes up 9 to 12 levels high.  You do get a nice look onto the open atrium as you ascend on the quick glass elevators at this property.

Unfortunately, this hotel is very out-of-date.  The lobby and cafe looks like something from the early to mid-80s.  The rooms are a little more contemporary though parts very dated; at the kitchenette sink, there was a bottom cabinet that may have been a dishwasher at one time; instead, it was empty with lots of dust and exposed piping (not nice to find at any hotel).

The breakfast buffet did not inspire freshness either.  The food quality was not horrible, but a lot of the food was quite salty.  Food options included bacon, sausage, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, continental breakfast options, and an omelet bar.  In addition, the poor lighting in the lobby and throughout the hotel made the food and other stuff maybe feel worse than they actually were.

This Marriott is still a comfortable place to stay and has good customer service.  The rooms are comfortable with good beds and linen.  The room temperature was fine though the unit did not seem to consistently keep the room cool.  The shower was fine.

This Marriott has many suites so you have a good shot of getting upgraded if you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member.  The suites are spacious and the bedroom is separated from the living room area with a door.  Their suites are outfitted with a mini fridge, kitchen sink (as mentioned) and a microwave.

On weekends, Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members get an offer of full breakfast buffet for two per Saturday and Sunday or 750 Marriott Rewards points per Saturday and Sunday.  This is a new nationwide Marriott benefit for Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members and the hotel is only obligated to offer a continental breakfast.  I have been to a few properties (Santa Clara Marriott, Minneapolis Marriott City Center) that are only doing the bare minimum--continental breakfast--so this Marriott is definitely going above and beyond in this area (though the quality of the full breakfast buffet, as already mentioned, was not that great).

The front desk was nice and helpful.

Room rates are good, but this hotel is not in Downtown Madison.  It is only a 7 to 10 minute drive to Madison though.  However, I am not sure if getting to Downtown Madison on a Wisconsin football game day is challenging.

This Marriott would not be a good property for a long stay.  This hotel just does not feel fresh enough.  It is a comfortable enough spot for a short stay though due to their comfortable rooms and good service.  If you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member, they do treat you well here and maybe even better than some Marriott properties.

This Marriott has its own free parking lot.  It is easy finding an open space.Fish fry was over cooked and greasy. People seem to like it here so maybe I just had it on a bad day.This place is running on the fact that there really is no good BBQ in Madison. And Smoky Jon, if that is his real name, may have won a lot of awards, but he is not selling that winning BBQ at this location.

I got off a plane starving after a long business weekend and I could not eat the ribs that were served because the tips were burnt and more like chewing tobacco than ribs. I wouldn't mention the sides because that is not why you go to these places, but Jon you need to get off the beach in Cancun and work on these recipes, they ST-I-N-K.Getting your hair cut here is worth the money if you don't plan on getting your hair cut every 6 weeks like you are supposed to.

However, do not get your nails done here. We called to make an appointment for gels. They booked us. We arrived and they told us we were going to get a complimentary hot wax dip, which I started and as they started to have me pick out the color of nail polish we started to clarify that this was gel nails (because gels don't have nail polish, they are clear). As one of my hands had already been dipped they told us that actually they don't offer the gel service there and there must have been some confusion. We should have left then, but since I had already dipped my hand we decided to stay and get mani-s. They CHARGED me for the wax dip and our nails didn't last two days.I pretty much knew that visiting this place was going to leave a lot to be desired.  The food here isnt/hasnt been/never will be good. You would think for a place that advertises wings that they would be better but nope, they suck. Knowing this, this time I ordered the buffalo chicken sammich and my friend ordered some cheese sticks. Now the sandwich only comes with beans or coleslaw, to add French fries is extra. So I scrapped the beans/slaw and got the fries. I'll address the cheese sticks first. My friend got the puniest, most pitiful looking cheese sticks I've ever seen. She said they weren't all that great (which is really sad cause its hard to mess us cheese sticks right?). My sandwich came with some curly fries that were horrible. They looked as if they hadn't been cooked long enough (they were white instead of that golden brown we all know and love), and some seasoning salt was sprinkled on top in an effort to distract me from how terrible they were. The sandwich though, was actually decent. There was a huge chicken breast patty dipped in buffalo sauce, sitting on top of a bun. So I enjoyed the sammich, but pretty much hated everything else. 

customer service was good, hence the two stars. If it wasn't for that, they wouldn't have gotten any. The beer was good and cold...like it was posed to be. The place was LOUD too...which actually worked in my favor and helped to distract my kid. Other than that, I don't really have many good things to say about this place. Umm...it was clean. Yup. That's it.Well, this is the 2nd time my fiance and I have been here. I must say, I'm disappointed.  We came during AZ Spring Restaurant week, so the menu was limited- we had the filet, the short ribs, cesar salad, tortilla soup, chocolate tarte, and berry tarte, ALL were excellently tasty! What I didn't like is their problem with gratuity. The first time we went here, they tagged on a 20% gratuity to the bill for no apparent reason- "meh, maybe its their policy". So, this time the restaurant week menu specifies that gratuity  will be added to the ticket- but the older folks next to us (mind you, the tables are VERY close together) ordered the EXACT same thing and their ticket was $15 less than ours. Disappointing- especially since the pregnant waitress in flip-flops took care of almost the entire dining room and paid very little attention to us. So, we're a bit disappointed by this discrepancy, and won't be returning. Too bad, the chocolate tarte was delish.We've been twice now, and nothing we have had has been very good. The ice cream and cake were mediocre, the onion rings were crispy-initially, the burgers were WAY overdone and made from cheap beef. Ask the bone chip in my husband's burger. The mushrooms were the canned pieces and stems variety, and the fries were crispy but heavy. The cole-slaw was excessively sweet and completely limp. 

The service has ranged from complete disinterest- no greeting, no eye-contact, and I had to beg for refills- to interactions between employees so uncomfortable that I wanted to say something. It's great if you have rapport, but the customers don't need to see you slap each other around and overhear you gossiping about each other- even in play. Or, if you hate your job at 5 & Diner, please find another one and stop throwing the dishes around at a volume that hurts my ears and ruins my experience. 

Management needs to intervene before this Phoenix institution falls apart.Would I go again? No.

i agree with some of the other reviews. chips needed salt, food was not fresh, beans were runny...i had the cheese enchiladas, they were ok...

my husband got a booger in his sprite. and the manager kept standing in front or around our table...not very comfortable.Very tired and in need of a makeover.
The pool area is awful - not comfortable or lush at all.  Very corporate.
Of all the wonderful resorts around Phoenix/Scottsdale, I'm surprised the Ritz would hold onto this property and it's "any city USA" vibe.
Turn it into a Marriott and call it a day until you open a resort.Went there a few weeks ago to get some emergency plumbing parts. A guy who was "there to help" didn't have a clue then some loud kid who couldn't be bothered to take his ear buds out of his head was a total jerk. I have been coming here for years but  I wouldn't come here if you need any kind of advice or come here during the day when the adults are working. 

On the other hand they sell ammo and they normally have a ton of it.this place is lots of hype with no actual show.

i'm a big fan of the sushi happy hour, and if you are too, don't go here. their happy hour menu consists of like 5 rolls. which are you average run-of-the-mill sushi rolls, nothing special (spicy tuna, caterpillar, blah poo roll). they were extremely cheap though, something like 3 dollars for 8 pieces. and when they arrived at the table, i could see why. they're seriously no bigger than quarters. pathetic sushi, really. the drink specials were nothing to gawk about either, $1 off certain drinks. they have a very limited beer selection as well. i'd rather have walked next door to delux and gotten some good draft hefe, but i craved sushi.

zen32 disappoints.Thank the good lord they are closing!  The fact that this place lasted so long is a testament to the fact that people will eat just about anything...
Lenny is the king of schlock food!I have nothing compelling to say because this restaurant is unremarkable.  The food is good.  I have eaten here a few times when I was with a group.  I wouldn't ever choose it on my own accord.C'mon man! Really! Your killing me! 
Houston's is such a great food and service oriented establishment that I was excited to take my wife there for her birthday. We were seated right away and the waiter was quick to ask for the drink order. We ordered wine by the glass. I like the service as far as they give, they change out your settings and take away the dishes in an anonymous way. We started with the artichoke, which was a special that night. Really good of course like Bandaras. The sauce was different, but we really enjoyed it. 

The Mrs ordered the Hawaiian ribeye with a weird lemon flavored caesar salad. I had the special NY strip steak Medium rare. We got our wine OK and they stopped by a few times to check on us. We got our entrees and everything looked great. The steaks were good size. The Hawaiian Ribeye was thinner than most ribeye cuts and had a Hawaiian sauce. Mehhhh very so so! The Strip came full of taste but a little tough. It came with fries which were awesome! I wish I had some bread or somethin... After the food came, it was like we were on an island. No one came until we were almost done. The Mrs. needed a refill and they took the glass away, but never asked if we would like another round. Bummer... C.mon - I drop over a Cnote and I cannot get another wine! Someone?... It was like they were just tryin to get us outta there. Boooo!

The vibe was awesome! The interior is great! Next time, I want to go sit at the bar with all the cougars and people wandering in from the patio looking for the front desk - that makes for good people watching. 

We skipped desert there and went to Culvers for frozen custard!A big fat FAIL to this Schlotzsky's location!!!! Had a dentist appointment and wanted to grab something to eat back at my desk at work.  Just went through the drive-thru and ordered my usual.  Turkey Bacon Club...everything cold EXCEPT the meat and cheese...on jalapeno bread.  

They totally f-ed up my order.  I got bread, meat, and cheese.  No lettuce, tomato, or mayo.  Dry sandwich.   What part of I want everything cold...except the meat and cheese did they not flipping understand?!  Oh and apparently when you say you want jalapeno bread...that in their mind means sourdough.  Nothing like eating a dry sandwich. 

Never going back to this location (though its right around the corner from my house).  

Should have stopped by the one across the street from work.I came here at 2 pm on Wednesday and there was a line out the door. My first thought was "doesn't anyone work anymore?" or do they all work nights like me?

I ordered the stacked turkey sandwich, the line moved pretty quickly and the girl at the counter was friendly. The next problem I encountered was finding a place to eat my sandwich. Here is hint: Remove all the pretentious crap (what they call "grocery") and put some more tables in the place. Focus on the food and the customers.

Now to the sandwich. What is the Cardinal Sin in sandwich making? The wrong bread, and yep, they did it. They used thin, flimsy 9 grain bread to hold together a stacked turkey sandwich, and after one bite, it all fell apart. So I was left to eat all the ingredients of the sandwich a la carte like a Thanksgiving meal. That's too bad, because it was obvious everything was great quality, and had they used Italian, French, Ciabatta, etc.,  I would not be giving this a 2 star review.

I may possibly return (am in no hurry)  for the treats, or a cappuccino and breakfast. The sandwich experience was too irritating to give another try, especially when a few blocks away The Vig is serving the best damn sandwiches in Phoenix.Back in the day, my daughter loved to come here for the peanut butter shakes and a bite o' meat.

Yesterday, a chili cheese dog was a supermarket frank with canned, soupy chili and a tab for $7.85 (root beer in a styrofoam cup included).

Atmosphere? None. Stuck-on mirror tiles with gold particles? Aplenty.OK...so I like to have my shirts pressed and cleaned for the all important work day or business meeting, so I use to go to Maroney Cleaners which is right across the street from Viking Cleaners but I switched to Viking after Maroney lost a shirt and two of my ties after being a faithful customer for several years, I just didn't feel like they new how to run their business after they lost my $100.00 Tommy Bahama shirt.  In any so I switched to Viking across the street and in any event Viking does a top notch job on cleaning the only problem is that they are extremely pricey, and not very honest, I dropped off 12 shirts and asked the girl how much they would cost to get laundered...not dry cleaned just laundered..the girl at the counter explained that it would cost about $2.50 a shirt but some of them would have to be dry cleaned based on the material, I said how much is that she said it was the same as being laundered, I said OK then, So 12 shirts at 2.50 a shirt $25.00 bucks...so I am like OK see you tomm. so I come in to pick up my shirts and the bill is $45.50...I ask the same girl who now has a huge hickey on the side of her neck...not very professional to say the least. She says oh well pants cost $5.00 to be pressed. I said I don't have any pants, she looks confused and then after reviewing my receipt she explains that two of my shirts need special cleaning and that cost extra and 5 of them had to needed to be dry cleaned which is $4.10 a shirt. to say the least I was peeved. And explained to them that I specifically asked the price when I left them to get cleaned...the girl was like I don't know who you talked to. I said it was you, which she denied ever saying that she quoted me the $2.50 price for dry cleaning which at this point I was furious and explained that I would never come back.  So they do a great job at cleaning but their staff is dishonest and unprofessional...Use at your own risk.Eesh. I'm going to try to avoid this place. I'll admit it's not my style at all though it suits others just fine: not veg friendly, not energetic, not worth the money. I don't have to eat like a health nut to enjoy my food, but even their french fries suck. And that's my main criteria for judging mediocre venues with limited meatless fare. You could earn an entire star with good french fries despite a crappy atmostphere. Native New Yorker? Fail.

The other food I saw wandering around looked pretty, um, bad...from what I hear the pizza is especially unappetizing. The waitstaff was average and on the slow side. The beer selection is ok and I sat contently with my Stella. But overall this is not my scene.Over 150 reviews for you to read about this mediocre steakhouse.  I ordered the St. Louis pork ribs which were very tender but slathered in a cloyingly sweet bbq sauce. The corn on the cob was more like creamed corn on the cob, been in hot water a long long time!  Their cowboy beans were average at best,  My wife had the all white meat fried chicken, fairly good and lots of it (3 breasts with the bone deep fried) but we had to ask for some gravy twice and then received half a shot glass of tasteless milk and flour white gravy, enough to sparely cover one breast.  The salad needed more dressing but was refreshing.  Best part of the meal was the Indian fry bread. The green beans were semi cooked and unseasoned.  The place was extremely noisy and on top of that a band played in the background.  I left with a headache and a resolve to never return for a $40+ meal.Brought my boyfriend for a cut today, got the same stylist... Vanessa. Sadly she butchered his cut and rushed him out the door, and there was only one other person waiting that the other stylist could have easily helped. I don't know what the problem was today, but I won't be revisiting this location.Ive been to Texass Roadhouse numerous times now and have really not been impressed. The rolls are good but I personally think that Logans Roadhouse has better ones (Logans are always soft and never overbaked, Texas's have been the last few times). Am I the only one that has noticed though that almost everything is wayyyy too salty? Every time I order fries here, they are doused in salt. The husband got the chicken fried sirloin last night with fries and both were super salty. The green beans have boatloads of salt too. Additionally, the ranch dressing tastes like crappy bottled Kraft dressing. One final thing that was a no go for me is that their fresh steamed vegis were terrible. Last night, their broccoli was not trimmed enough the ends of it were very hard and fibrous and the carrots were not cooked enough so they were still hard. Booooo. I am not a fan of vegis as it is but when eaten this way, I really despise them.
Now what has been good is their chili although it is a bit rich. Its very meaty so if I ever have to go here (with a group of people, I wont come here on my own), I would just get a bowl of this and have some rolls. The husband also says that the ribs are great. They are always fall of the bone tender. Aside from that, we are unimpressed with everything else. One other thing is that their portions are fairly large. However, the food, as mentioned is kinda crappy so if you like eating lots of crappy uninspired food, this is your place. I have nothing against chain restaurants but this is one of those that I don't get what the hype is about (see my list of overhyped places). This place is always busy and the wait is at least an hour each time I have been to this location. They don't take reservations or call ahead.
I would advise to try Logans instead. Not only do they have better rolls but their menu is better and has more selections. Logan's food is always better as well and they have sweet potato fries which is one of my weaknesses. Also, their wait is never bad. Sorry Texass but in my opinion, you kinda suck.

PS: If you hate kids, DO NOT COME HERE. They are everywhere! The staff also seems to have a hard time accommodating large groups and there is not enough space in the area where they pile the large groups. You literally cannot move and the waiters have a hard time getting around the tables.Panda Express, I wish I could quit you! Especially after I stupidly keep coming back to this location. The staff here can't multi-task. When they try to, that's when people's food starts to get mixed up and down and around. Let's focus on one person at a time. That's great that you want to help 10 people at a time but again the staff can't handle that. Especially Jesus, good luck at successfully telling him you'd like a 3 item entree. *slow blinks* He's way too flustered. 

You guys write what I want on my container so why do I constantly have to remind you for the third item like 5 times? 

The last time I was here there was nobody else and I waited too long to get service. We were acknowledged by a staff member sweeping but....................I guess his brain wasn't sending signals to his feet that day to walk over immediately to take our order.  Eventually something clicked up there that paying customers were waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting to get service. OMGI love 5 and Diners and I feel bad giving this one a bad review but really there were so many mistakes made I just can't bring it up to 3 stars. 

On the good side I really liked our server Valerie. 

On the bad side I ordered a cheeseburger with chips and what I was brought was a bacon burger or bacon cheeseburger, whichever, with fries. I noticed the fries right away and told her I had ordered chips so she took it back and switched them, but I didn't notice that the cheeseburger had bacon on it until after I took a bite. It did taste good so I decided to go ahead and eat it and see which one I was charged for. The bacon one of course was a dollar more.  

She had asked how I wanted the meat prepared and one of the things I liked about 5 and Diner is the fact that you could get your meat cooked just the way you like it. I told her medium rare. She repeated it back to me but when the hamburger arrived it was actually more medium than rare. It tasted great but there was no pink in it at all so that was a disappointment. One reason I'd  been anxious to return to the Arizona Mills location was because the meat was so delicious  and cooked perfectly, grilled outside, pink inside.  It was still good so I  decided to go ahead and eat it. She didn't come back to fill our water until we asked although she did ask us several times did we need anything. I did have tummy issues the next day. I won't go into details.

The milkshake was delicious. I forgot to order malt in it which is 50 cents more.  She was nice enough to divide it between 2 to-go cups because the kids were getting fussy so we had 2 generous  cups with chocolate cherry milkshake for about $4.59. Both of the hamburger meals were just pennies away from 10 dollars each which I personally think it's kind of high for a hamburger. 

We had the opportunity to ask Valerie if she knew what had happened to the 5 and Diner at Arizona Mills and she told us she had been the owner of it and it broke her heart to have to close it but the shopping center assessed some very high tax fees on the business that was more than she could afford to pay even though business was booming. You know you can't just pay all your income out on taxes, rent and such, you gotta make something. 

I would honestly hesitate to go back to this location because of all the errors that were made and the tummy problems I had the next day. Maybe next trip I will try the Scottsdale location because it seems to have really good reviews.It's Denny's.  Basic American food and reasonable prices.  We did not try a "slam" here, so I can't comment on that (unlike my other Denny's reviews).  Service was adequate.  Food was adequate.  Nothing special.  We specifically went for the Lord of the Rings menu because we had sampled that on a recent birthday, and wanted to try other items (plus had a coupon).  My wife had a Shire skillet, and I had the Ring burger.  As I already said, not bad but nothing special.Great location, by the lake... that's the only decent part.  There's no parking when it's busy, the staff is rude and the coffee isn't all that great.Sushi was decent.  Felt like the only thing that was fresh was salmon. Waitress was good.  Sushi chef (Andy) I believe his name was gave horrible service. He was only paying attention to the two girls that were in front of him. The were only 2 tables including us and it took him 15 mins to make 4 pieces of nigiri. Then our order of salmon nigiri was doubled cause he didn't tell the other chef what he made. Other than that place was nice. Nice warm feeling.Went once and never again! awful service and food mediocre.We have been regulars at Teakwoods for more than 18 years.  Can't beat their wings.  Best in town hands down.

Unfortunately, their prices have gotten high and the quality of their other food isn't the same as in years past.  My favorite was always Wednesday night soup with their Chicken Enchilada Soup, but they have changed it somehow.  Won't even order it again.  They also changed their seating and the high top chairs are very uncomfortable.  Feel like you are tipped and slipping down.

We used to go at least 1 once a week and now maybe once every other month.I really used to like this place but when the management changed, so did everything else. I remember when for lunch there would be a line to the door, now I never see anyone in there. I might go here 1 or 2 times a year, nothing really that great about it anymore, right when I step in the place seems kind of dirty and isn't very welcoming. If they made some changes..this place could be decent again.Service sucks.  Get there 8 minutes to close which is 5:30 on a weekday and got told you have 3 minutes to find your tree and they didn't even help us find our tree.  What's funny is about 4 separate people showed up at the same exact time and they basically tried to turn everyone away. The two white guys obviously don't care about the business cause they were just rude to us. Jose however was awesome and very helpful so if your gonna go, ask for him.  Didn't find our tree and probably won't go back due to the bad service.  I might go back to offer Jose a job though.I don't usually like to write negatively about any business, especially local businesses...but I just had to in this case. We've lived in Queen Creek for about a year and a half and been to this cafe several times, as well as to the adjoining bar. This place need an overhaul from top to bottom. It always seems dirty and has an extremely outdated western feel to it. The staff, although friendly enough, was very unprofessional (not bringing us a high-chair [which I ended up having to get myself], laughing and joking loudly in the dining area, yelling back and fourth with the kitchen staff from the dining area...).

The food can be summarized in one word: disappointment. I've had several different sandwiches and they were bland and VERY greasy. Appetizers were the same, under-seasoned and dripping with grease. I love a good fish fry and I must admit I've had theirs more than once. It's decent most times but very hit-and-miss. Tarter sauce is not very good however. 

To be fair, they do make a good burger most times. Good size patties and a good seasoning used in them. The only negative issue with the burgers are their "Bacon Burgers" which they make that have the bacon mixed into the burger itself. The concept is WONDERFUL,,,sounds terrific in theory. The issue however is that the bacon meat and the beef don't have the same cooking times and the bacon on the inside of the patty remains pretty much raw. I ordered it one time and one time only. It's the ONLY Bacon Cheeseburger I have ever not finished. Again...disappointing. 

The bar is ok...it's a typical dive bar. Not bad for a drink or two from time to time or if you want to watch a game.

I wanted to love this neighborhood hole-in-the- wall soooo badly when I moved to Queen Creek...I just can't.Went here for reverse happy hour with some friends.  Never been a huge fan of Ra considering I feel there are other better sushi restaurants around, but the majority wanted to go here so I went.  Definitely good happy hour prices but still not all that great.  I ordered for the hubby and I:  the chicken wings, tootsie maki roll, Ra-ukin Shrimp and korean bbq short ribs.  

I honestly don't have a lot to say about this place because there is nothing sticking out of my mind.  For all of that, my bill came to $33 including an 18% gratuity.Not a fan of my sandwich being tossed into the microwave twice. I think they heated up the turkey in the microwave and then they decided to melt the cheese in the micro as well. This was the turkey rueben and it was a pretty lame move on these guys part, especially when I see a flattop grill right below the microwave. Bread would have been crispier and the sandwich as a whole would have been great, but even these two local women decide to take shortcuts and the results are a soggy sandwich made by lazy cooks/owners. They still use quality turkey, but the rest is a joke.Disappointed with Chipolte at Frank Lloyd Wright & Thompson Peak in North Scottsdale. We couldn't find a clean table inside or on the patio. The floor was dirty, and we didn't notice any effort to clean-up the restaurant.My husband and I went there for our friends birthday dinner. The food wasn't that great and the salad looked like it was from one of those salad bags that you can get at a grocery store. Our waiter was very nice, but the food wasn't so great. I think Olive Garden is better than this.This place isn't classy and has a Ross in it for crying out loud!! But...I am en love with Fredrick's of Hollywood!!! You won't find a Nordstrom in this mall.The past few times I have stopped at this restaurant to use the drive thru; its been backed up to at least 9 cars.  This McDonalds had customers all confused of who was next in line, which unfortunately there was customers trying to cut in from another side of the drive thru. BUT still if McDonalds was having a order that was taking longer then usual, then ask the customers nicely to park to the side so you can move the other cars waiting.  I thought maybe the whole Restaurant was behind but someone parked and went inside to get their food, to come out only 2 minutes later.  Unfortunately I could not do that since I was caught in the middle of the line.  That indicated to me that they were not behind through the whole store, it was just the drive thru that was sucking.  I like this McDonalds, but they need to be aware of their customers outside also. Its unpleasant when you have to deal with other customers trying to act like they been in line the whole time and trying to cut in from a different side of the McDonalds.  Very rude.  Its common knowledge that the mornings and lunch hours are the busiest, put in better procedures or processes to make sure the customer is happy.I was underwhelmed.  I liked the charcoal grilled taste to the dog but I've had a much better dog than Ted's.  Nathan's for instance is a superior hotdog.  I really wanted to like this place but everything was just okay, not good, not great.Great view.  Slow poor service.  Bar service is good, restaurant service sucks.  Looks like young inexperienced staff--not to be expected for how this places touts itself or what the prices are.  It took forever to get our food.  We had a $50 Groupon and it was so slow they comped our meail--and I am not coming back to use the Groupon--or for any other reason.  Food was good, but high prices in the restaurant and no frills--no bread, no salt & pepper on the table.  This place was such a huge disappointment--I have been here many times in the long past, but never again.  The atmosphere is crowded --overly so--and you can hardly hear each other talk--the made more than half of the restaurant into the bar--and that's the only place for good service. There are other places with views--I will not go here again.   You go out to a nice place not just for the food, most especially the exprience.  Awful.I ordered the $11.99 Sashimi lunch today and was really disappointed with what I got. It's supposed to come with 12 pieces of sashimi, but the problem is that most of it was what I'd consider 1/2 size pieces, really tiny. It came with miso soup which was nice and hot, but no rice? I think this is the first time I've ordered a sashimi meal and didn't get rice to go with it. 

The single piece of salmon was very lean (no fat) missing that lovely creamy taste that I enjoy so much. And I don't remember any yellow tail on there at all. 

Maybe the other lunch specials are better, but this deal was horrible. Left hungry and felt cheated by the small portion size.I LOVE WINGS. I love love love wings. But I didn't love Buffalo Wild Wings. 

I've read the previous reviews about service experienced at BWW and want to clarify that I didn't dine in, I simply called in my to go order. 

I don't know how something as simple as calling in a to-go order could be so screwed up. I literally called - just ordering two small orders of wings, they said "Great, it'll be ready in 10 minutes!" Well great! I show up 10 minutes later and it's not busy, it was like a Tuesday afternoon. There were waitresses chilling out and talking - it was relaxed. So why did I have to wait an extra 20 minutes for my wings? It had been 30 minutes from my original phone call by the time I got them. 

Following that - the wings sucked! So, so, so greasy - yuck!

However I must list the positives: (which is why I gave my review an additional star)
I was greeted with a smile when I came in. 
A nice looking manager asked me if I was okay after watching me wait for 15 minutes in the lobby.
The cashier apologized for the wait.

So I was treated nicely, but I'm not going to ignore the fact I waited 30 minutes for 2 small wings that were disgusting.Walmart just runs a gong show everyday. The aisles are always blocked and all the workers are always in a bad mood, I don't blame them though I would be too if I was treated as poorly as they are. Walmart is good for if you need something when your drunk at like 3 in the morning and everything else is closed.Being a creature of habit anytime I want good sushi I go to Tokyo Lobby.  Well, my group wanted to branch out and try something new so we decided on Sakana. Not a fan.  And what's shocking to me is this place was packed!  The restaurant opens at 5:30 on Saturday and we arrived at around 5:45 and were lucky to get the last open table.  I don't get it...

Messy rolls that all tasted the same.  We ordered the tootsie roll and the crunch roll, both tasted similar, except of course for the crunchy captain crunch on top.  Just a mushy mess, that was hard to eat.  Bland tempura.  No bueno.  I did, however, have a very good tuna poke salad, but I would not go back just for that. 

If you want good sushi on the west side, or the entire valley for that matter, say no to Sakana and yes to Tokyo Lobby.I went in here for the first time in around 12 years. It was ugly and cluttered and not well lit. I am also thoroughly disappointed that they do not do any discounts or donations for nonprofit organizations that are centered around kids.Very nice people, cool place - the food was OK - but I must say the pies were not good, not good at all.  Our table had the apple, rhubarb and pecan pie slices and uniformly not one liked the pie or finished the slice.  The pies are over hyped and not very good.

The frozen pies from Marie Calendar's or Sara Lee or Claim Jumper are much better. Mind you I used to be a pastry chef and it was very sad to see the fillings and undercooked crusts and toppings nearly raw.I went to Hooters in FLA when they first opened and thought they had the best chicken wings ever. Unfortunately, ever since they became really popular, I haven't been able to repeat that experience in the ensuing 15 years and 30+ states. I have to preface this review by stating that I'm wicked fussy about my chicken. 
The wings aren't awful, but they are not the best either. They were moist, but the coating was somewhat hard in places and there were rubbery tendons inside (like a rubber band between your teeth). I have NEVER had wings that still had the "tips" attached and these did along with a few quills broken off inside them. The service was OK and the food came quickly. Chik-A-Fil, Popeyes or good ol' KFC is a bit better though.Awful food!! Shells are not crispy, partially cooked, meat has NO NO NO flavor.  Their combinations stink - People don't just eat Enchilada's! Poor choice on the Taco salad. Rolled tacos are called Taquitos.  There is no juiciness with the Fajitas, the prices are out of sight. Re-fried Beans are usually mashed so there are bits of beans, but not whole uncooked beans...disgusting! Kid's menu goes to 10, what are 11, 12  year olds? Adults? 

Your menu needs an overhaul. The bathrooms are small and smell like mildew. Waitresses take forever to get you drink refills - unless its a bar item. The space in the building is so cramped you can't sit 4 comfortably at a table. 

The old green color on the walls is so uninviting. Why not decorate like an authentic Mexican restaurant? Horse pictures - is old west, not Mexican. American / Mexican restaurant - maybe. 

Anita's Cocina is tired, needs a desperate update. Get with today's technology offer free wifi. Take your outside decorations inside, call restaurant impossible...you need help!I got spam and eggs and rice.  I know its nothing big, but I have it at a lot of other places and this was just blah.. I could have totally made it better at home.  My friends said the bowls they got were pretty good, but I just wasn't impressed.  I would rather go to the Cal hotel and get oxtail there or topselog filipino breakfast.   Now that is what I call Yumm.If you genuinely like any Denny's, you should probably stop visiting/reviewing Yelp.I took my family and my brother here on 4/30/12 using a Groupon I purchased the same day.  It seemed like a good deal.  $24.00 for a large pizza, 2 aps, and 4 drinks.

The first sign of a less than great experience was getting a flavored iced tea when I ordered iced tea.  Iced tea is fine by its self.  It doesn't need extra/added flavor.  I have no problem with offering flavored tea, but you need to have plain brew iced tea as well.  Then I asked for a diet Pepsi.  What did I get?  Regular Pepsi.

The next issue was getting a highchair for my daughter.  I asked three times before finally getting it myself.

When we ordered appetizers, they were out of what we wanted.  No fried zucchini? Really?  The pizza was okay, but nothing special.  It was thick crust, half Hawaiian, half peperoni and sausage.

The last straw was when they brought me my check.  The Groupon was for a total value of $50.40.  My TOTAL bill came to 50.00 exactly.  What bothered my was they charged me $3 for the thick crust even though the total was less than the max allowed under the Groupon deal.  Even after asking, they wouldn't take it off.  

Overall, the service left a sour taste in my mouth.  The food was just okay.  In a town full of crappy pizza, they weren't able to distinguish themselves with a better product.  And even with a Groupon, I don't feel as though I got a good value.

I won't be coming back anytime soon, if ever.I have been here twice, and Osaka does not stand out when I try to think about a sensational Japanese restaurant in Vegas. There are three requirements which I look for in a restaurant; service, deals, and food quality. 

I would not suggest Osaka as a place to go catch up with friends, because you will end up leaving frustrated. The service was lacking. We came around lunch, and it was quiet, yet we were missing many basic essentials such as plates when our appetizers had come out and drinks were not refilled regularly. 

The food was decent, but nothing particularly special. I ordered the lunch bento box with broiled unagi and grilled salmon. My salmon was on the dry side and I had to douse it in lemon juice and toss it in the excess miso dressing from my salad. The unagi was delicious, but it was the most anorexic eel I have ever eaten. It was mostly skin, but that was cooked beautifully with a nice crunch. It came with rice, a salad, two pieces of gyoza, and two pieces of California roll for 15 dollars. This was a decent price, but I was left underwhelmed. 

I was looking at their lunch special which gave you a choice of one main for 8 bucks. Maybe that would be classified as a deal, if someone tries it, please write if it is worth giving Osaka another chance.Yes, I am ruining The Artisan. Let me start by saying I have celebrated several birthdays over the years here and encouraged others. I have stayed in the rooms, dined here in the past and all I can say about it now is G-H-E-T-T-O. Not to be confused with ghetto fabulous either. 

The two stars is for the actual building and lighting and beautiful Gothic, eclectic decor and artwork making Artisan unique to others. The djs get a huge fist pound as well for spinning sick beats and being the only cool people left in the building. Now on to the huge three throbbing stars they will never see again. 

On my last visit it was a gorgeous night out and they had opened the patio. I venture out there thinking it would be a chic, chill place to listen to good music and have cocktails with friends. NOT. They were playing Justin Bieber through the sound system! Ugh. This is not Chuck E Cheese, people!!!! Secondly, if there was a waitress outside she was no where to be seen and I waited for over 30 minutes. Now to touch on the service. The Artisan use to have the most beautiful bartenders and cocktail waitresses in town. All with smiling faces and quick drinks just as you ordered them. The past two visits I made were for the after hours and I must say the waitresses all looked odd to me and not in a good way. One female looked sickly thin in her corset that appeared four sizes too large for her. The hair and makeup were not put together at all and she seemed on the verge of tears, too. The other looked completely TRASHED drunk and was slurring when getting our drink orders. When she stumbled back to bring our drinks they were all wrong times two rounds. Ugh. I don't know if she was bloated from all the alcohol she had been drinking, but her corset was ripping on the seams a bit! At least her blonde hair was "did" and she had glittery rave makeup on. I felt the service looked unprofessional and was unprofessional and both waitresses need interventions ASAP. 

This use to be the classy after hours all of the dancers from the shows and trendy locals would go to hide from the big clubs and enjoy drinks and friends in an upscale lounge. Now it appears like trash to me. If the staff is allowed to drink or not they should still be able to take drink orders and look professional. This place is a gem to Vegas and just isn't shining like it use to....... Work it out Artisan.A very interesting boutique hotel. I've seen pictures on Hotels tonight and was very intrigued by them and wanted to go by and visit the hotel lobby on my next Vegas visit. Was not intending to stay there, but stayed 1 night because of the good deal on Hotels tonight. Did not know anything about the after-hours club, or the noise level. If I did I would have not chosen to stay here, as the music was overwhelming coming up thru the floors of the 4 story hotel.
Upon check in the valet asked if we stayed here before or knew about the hotel. When we said no, he told us about the club going to 8am. Apparently the only nights they do not have the after-hours club is on Monday and Tuesday, so ask for a room that is not over the club. 
We are not club people, so getting back into the hotel at night was like going thru security at the airport lol, had to speak to 2 different people to get into the lobby to get to the elevator to get to the room. 

The noise level was loud, but it was because the walls were thin and we could hear the dog in the room next door yelp and bark, the traffic outside because of the thin glass window, and the people above us sounded like they were going to come thru the floor into our room when they walked since the squeaking was so bad.
Also the hallways are loud since the floor is tiled and not carpeted. Since this hotel is an old Travelodge, so are the rooms and I took that into consideration with the thin walls and floors. Unfortuantly our A/C didn't cool the room even tho is was on the coolest setting at 60 degrees, it only cooled the room down to about 75. 

Loved the chic goth style of the hotel, but it's better for more of a drink and not to stay unless maybe you're going to the after-hours party.
The check in gentleman was nice and helpful, but I thought the $150 "deposit" for 1 night was a little steep.If you're originally from Vegas, you might like it but if you come from a city where a large Vietnamese resides. This pho isn't good. Too much sodium in the soup. Really nothing about this place besides it being open late.Their quality of food has gone done as I came here throughout the years for pho in Vegas. 

At my last recent visit, the broth was bland and the pho noodles were stuck together in clumps. The soup for it was plain and tasteless too. The bun bo hue's noodles were too hard and weren't boiled long enough and the customer service has gone down. The servers seem more clueless and lost. They often forget to refill our water when we asked and not remember to bring us whatever we asked. 

Not coming back.Came here with my Family for the first time a few weeks ago. I was definitely not impressed. We sat in the section where you get to grill your own food, ordered just about every type of meat on the menu as it was four of us, we were hungry, and we wanted to try everything. I honestly cant remember one thing that I thought was good. The meat was so bland and tasteless! The sides were not very good either.

 It could be that I am just not used to this type of food but in my opinion it was not very good at all. Mind you I was HUNGRY when I went here.  My family did not care for it either and we all agreed we would most likely never return.Prior to the complimented rooms that I received to The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, Flamingo, and NYNY I had to get room not complimented for a couple of nights. I looked up a room that was a little off the strip and found out that Palace Station had rooms at $15.00 a night. I thought to myself was "That is dirt cheap'! You do get what you pay for in the room. It looked like a cheap motel room. 

I didn't know was that the Palace Casinos (Red Rock, Green Valley Ranch etc) charged about $17 hotel fee per night on top of the room rate. The fee includes internet access, gym/pool use and shuttles to/from the airport or strip. Which is worth the fee if you used most of the things offered. I ended up using everything except for the pool.

The casino itself was decent looking and they do have great restaurants here though. The rooms were pretty crappy though.I took my son here to spend about $200 on a RC helicopter. There were a few other customers and I took a spot at the counter. I stood there for a few minutes while another lady was being helped. The associate behind the counter, an older gentleman with a huge food stain on his shirt, stood there while another gentleman helped the lady. This guy wouldn't even look me in the eye. After about 3 minutes I walked to another part of the store when my boy ran over and told me he had to go NOW!! 
Any parent can appreciate the timer that begins to count down when a kid says they have to go to the bathroom. I re-approached the guy behind the counter and asked where the bathroom was. He replied "they're closed to the public. You'll have to go next door (to the Savers store)". I told the guy we were customers, not homeless people who are hanging outside, and my boy had to go bad. The guy just shook his head at me and didn't even say anything. 
Well needless to say we left the store and will take our money elsewhere. Don't waste your time at this place. They have a decent selection, but no customer service. And no bathroom. Going out of business in....3.....2....I grew up in Asia so I am spoilt with the best Asian food. Decided to try this place because of the good reviews on yelp. Ordered Pad Thai with shrimp, soft shell crab and pad kee Mao.
Took one bite of pad Thai and it pisses me off. They can't even do such a simple generic Thai dish right! Soft shell crab is super oily and tasteless, don't know why they put it on the menu board? The pad kee Mao is oily but tasty. I will not be going back. To be considered in my book of good eats, the restaurant needs to be consistently good every time I visit. This is not such a restaurant. Maybe we went on a day when the chef is depressed... Lotus of Siam is way better.everyone at pair-a-dice does fantasic work. ive gotten three piercings and two tattoos from jesse. the work was amazing. eveything healed up well and looks great. im always getting compliments.  however, at my last visit to see him to get mine at my friends septums pierced, things were slightly uncomfortable. while paying for my services, he smacked my ass and said some sexual comments. i dont think ill ever return, which saddens me becuase the artwork is top notch. but i DO NOT reccomend young ladies visit him alone. but other than that its a nice place. everyone else is incredibly professional and welcomingClean. Tasty. Did NOT make me sick but still got a headache from the MSG.Meh. I've experienced better.

This is just a continuation of my previous review.  I had a due-out from it, so please read it as well for a total picture.

Since this was a separate visit as well, let's talk about it in brief.  A burger is something I would expect any self-respecting BBQ place to do well.  Granted, to make one, it requires grilling, and not BBQing.  I guess this establishment just considers it beneath them to care about something as benign as a burger.

It's hard to excel at a burger, but it's also hard to mess one up.  Well, let me tell you of a few ways to lead down the wrong path as demonstrated here.  First, don't ask me how I want the burger done.  Typically if a burger is cooked beyond medium, it's because they're using an inferior meat.  Secondly, burger preparation is supposed to be minimalist, but not lacking entirely.  A waft of seasoning is all that's required, but I guess that doesn't work if all the burgers are the same preformed base for each menu version.  Thirdly, don't cook the heck out of a burger.  Luckily it wasn't fast food bad, but it was definitely poor workmanship.  Definitely not worth the price.

The hushpuppies didn't strike me as fresh, and they didn't have any semblance of being hand-made.  Yet, they did provide a medium in which to test their sauces, which I forgot to do on my first visit.  Their Original is far from its name-sake as it can it.  It takes just about like ever other BBQ sauce I've had (keep in mind I'm not a fan of any though).  The Red Sticky just seems like their Original mixed with some ketchup and maybe more (brown) sugar.  I honestly can't say if it made it better or worse.  Lastly, my "favorite" of the three would be their Spicy.  I wouldn't call it Spicy as in picante, but Spicy as in at least they put some spices in to give it flavor.

I guess I should have ordered some of their slaw to remind me why I risked another visit in the first place..Wherewere the tee markers?  Guess they removed them for oversee ending. 
We got lost several times and played the wrong hole.  No directional signs leaving green to tell you where the next hole was.  Frustrating!   Also the kid at the cart return was snotty. Poor customer relations.The two stars are for our bus boy and the one attempt our server made to help us. 

FOOD- was horrible. The chips were ok. Salsa was ok, beans were bland.  I ordered a combo plate, a pork tamale, and a chille rellano. The pork tamale had next to no meat.. I scraped most of it out and it was one bite. The chile rellano was slimy and salty. The beans and rice were bland.  I didn't eat much of it. 

My fiance ordered a shrimp burrito. It was not as described to us when we asked and it smelled. Like rotten fish. Not only that but it was full of "scallops". Which turned out to be bat ray wing, not even real scallops, those were chewy. He sent the whole thing back because of the smell and the tortilla was soggy/mushy it had the consistency of mashed potatoes.  15 bucks for THAT? C'mon now. 

Our friends had a burrito and combo plate, they were not impressed either. 

SERVICE- We had to wait 20 minutes for a table when over half the restaurant was empty. We ended up with a crappy table.  

 The bus boy should have been our waiter. He was pleasant and came back promptly and frequently to ask if we needed anything and to refill our drinks.  Our waitress wasn't awful, but she was short, and acted like we were a huge inconvenience the second she walked up.  She did however look worn out and made an attempt to be pleasant about the burrito we sent back. It took a while to have our order taken, which would have been fine had they been even slightly busy. 

I tried to get a group of employees attention to take the check, I held it up and they just looked at me and went back to talking. 

Our friends and I were leaving when my fiance was stopped by the manager and asked how everything was. He told her he felt it was over priced for the quality, and some issues with the food. Like his mushy, smelly, burrito,  and my tamale having no meat. She got snotty and said "you're wrong , I watched them make the tamales". She then said "well if you had a problem you should have said something before" ( um hello, genius, we sent food back and told our waitress!)  This is what angered us the most. Don't ask people what they thought and be rude if you don't like the answer! Very unprofessional. We still paid our full bill so it's not like we don't have a right to complain when asked.  Change the garbage you serve and you won't have as many problems!  

We won't be back, over priced,  bad food, and so-so service.Horrible food very salty and greasy. They forgot one of our orders but the food was so bad we canceled it and left you pay for what you get gross never againIve been coming here for years... the most recent server turnover sux. Today, I had to move my own stuff when i asked for a different table.... didnt get any attention when i was thirsty and hungry.... but 2 hours later, when obviously she was rushing me to free up the table, i saw her twice every 5 minutes. 

The food, however, is always the best. Something Wrong #69 is my fave!How did this place get so many good reviews??  Maybe I'm the weirdo here.

My experience starts with a watery diet Pepsi.  The albacore didn't seem to be the best cut.  Sashimi is giant thick chunks, not very light on the mouth.  The 911 roll was way salty (mouth is still salted out).  My other roll was only okay.

On the positive, all the fish is fresh, and they have a good selection.  You get a little cucumber salad to start, which was okay.  Service was fine.Qualifier':  I stopped using chopsticks when I was 9, except for Sushi. Born and raised in San Francisco from a restaurant family, so I've eaten Chinese food for 46 years. 
Went KJ's because of good reviews on Yelp and it was my initials! in the name. Krishna Jon

For me, a sure tell, bench mark of a spot is Beef Chow Fun, Black Bean Sauce, Wet. That's what I ordered and got:
Watery sauce, Onion and Bell Pepper, Low grade beef. One of those I ate it, but wouldn't order it again things. It was fresh, to it's credit. Some of things on the menu look intriguing, ( deer meat clay pot! ) and some of the things mentioned in the other reviews looked nice too. But the dirt factor.

In response to one the reviews, My Chinese friends have a saying about dirty restaurants too. Nasty. The one fish tank was cloudy, the spot was greasy and the bathrooms, yuck! 

You can get good, authentic Chinese food in a clean place, But don't get me wrong, I have a warm place in my heart for the greasy spoon, Chinese, American or otherwise. If you are ever in The City, try Canton on Folsom for my lowest acceptable standard on the Greasy spoon, great food! Or Tong Kiang for quality and clean class on the authentic tip. Would go back to KJ only if somebody took me there, late at night.HORRIBLE customer service. My sister and I went there after having no success at finding a brides maid dress from David's Bridal. No one greeted us. After browsing for 10 minutes I finally had to find someone to help us. I told her what we were looking for and she just brushed us off. It was a terrible experience. That alone caused them to lose our business. They get 2 stars because the dresses were beautiful and they had a decent amount of accessories to chose from. I would never suggest this place to anyone.Man look at those ratings... Either love it or hate it...  Anyway, I was so excited to go here but was kinda let down because I expected it to be an extravagant LAS VEGAS all out type of deal but it just looked like an old run down hotel too far to walk to from with a new hooters sign...

I mean the hooter girl slot machines and the big orange Jeep (or was it a hummer...) that was on display was pretty cool...

Eh I was just expecting too much I guess?Gaming, Darts pool table, food, and great staff. Its alittle smoky in there but its My ptsMy husband and I had lunch on a week day about  1:00. Our waitress took our order then went to sit at the bar and eat. Our food was brought to us by someone else. We had to ask for silverware and drink refills. Nobody ever came back to our table to check on us. If  they had come back I would have mentioned that my steak sandwich which I ordered medium well was very under cooked and my husbands burger ordered medium was very well done. We were one of two tables of people in the place. Would not come back. Service and food both lacking.Decent food+bad service+bad value= two stars.

I went to Chautara with a group of seven or eight people.  It was very crowded and the waiter was running around like a mad man.  Taking orders felt more like an interrogation, and while I would have liked to order another beer he never asked.  One member of our party didn't get his entree until they were clearing everyone else's plate (to their credit, they comped his meal-- it definitely would have been one star without that).

The food was actually pretty tasty-- I ordered lamb korma and enjoyed it.  But the portion sizes were very small and the price (16$) was completely outrageous for three small chunks of lamb and white rice.  I definitely won't be going back.I was expecting an authentic indonesian restaurant in madison. reason is that there are many indonesian student in Madison. but apparently, not.
don't get me wrong, it is not bad, because the food is now tailored to american taste. I'm kinda surprise to see soo many people in the restaurant, and I'm the only non white.
I ordered empek2, sayur lodeh, tahu and some other items.
the food don't even look right (close), but it don't taste even close to what it supposed to be.
if you think you've taste indonesian food and you think that place taste good. wait till you taste the real good one. it will blow your sock off.

good place to get to know indonesian food. but for people who are looking for good indonesian food, not here.Overpriced. Nice staff, in spite of having to listen to the owner-or-whoevers stupid self-produced "country" music all night. That didn't help the dining experience much at all; I was annoyed after 15 minutes, I can't imagine having to listen to that all the time. The walk home through the silent construction dinosaurs on Willy street at night was more interesting than the food.I've been here a couple of times for brunch.  And every time, something is sort-of off.  First time, my eggs were way overcooked.  The yolks were hard even though they had said they would do sunny side up. Second time, the potato salad they brought with the main dish was basically flavorless and the potato seemed uncooked.

There was also a very disturbing art exhibit on display the first time I went there.  And a really big disfigured painting of a head in the bathroom that scared me...a bit inappropriate for a small french cafe on willy street.  They should stick to more benign things.

Cute, has potential, and maybe I should try it for some other meal (maybe they're not really cut out for brunch), but I was disappointed overall.I have been a longgggg time fan of Sa-Bai Thong.. never had a dish I didn't like. I did however order food to go tonight, and I'm wishing I hadn't. I have the University Ave number in my phone and it's the only one I ever call. I placed a very large order tonight to take to family I have at home, I get there and wait 20 minutes no problem. When I offer to pay to expedite my wait time I'm told that I called and places the order at their Odana location.. I didn't. I doubled checked in my phone to be sure. At first they offered to make me a new order but then the manager told the employee helping me that I'd have to wait for their delivery driver to bring it to this location from their Odana one and that it'd be another 40 minutes. No one apologized of even acknowledged that this was frustrating or out of character, on the contrary I was blamed for calling the wrong location even after showing that I had not.  I waited because the food would be thrown out if I just left and I'm not as rude as the service I received tonight. I am tentative about what I will do in terms of eating at this place in the future :(This is for the Dells location which didn't come up on Yelp but I'm sure it would be the same review anyway...so would you think "Devil's Spit" BBQ sauce would be spicy? You'd be wrong here....no heat just endless sugar and salt...even the broccoli!It's been a while since I was there, but I wasn't on Yelp then so didn't review Vera's initially.  I went to Vera's twice.  The first time was a positive experience.  The consultant was friendly and showed me a few different styles so I could get an idea for what I wanted.  The second trip was a completely different story!  We changed our wedding to a destination and so I was looking for a different type of dress.  When I called to make the second appointment I requested the same consultant and they said that wouldn't be a problem.  When we got there, we were waiting and I saw my consultant starting to work with another bride.  I asked the woman at the desk if there had been some mistake, as I had requested the same consultant.  They said it wouldn't be a problem and switched.  Big Mistake!  Clearly my consultant had no desire to work with me.  I'm not sure if that was because it was my second visit or if it had something to do with changing the type of dress I wanted.  But whatever it was, she was very unfriendly this time around.  I asked to see dresses by a particular designer and she refused to show me any, saying they weren't good quality.  In the end, I left very unhappy and vowed not to purchase a dress from them.  I then had my second visit to Brandi's Bridal in New Glarus and purchased my dress there!Decided to try Garcia's restaurant based upon other reviews.

Upon entering I decided to sit at the bar which was quite large however I was the only person sitting there which seemed a bit odd. The bartender was friendly enough however there seemed to be a lot of staff just milling around doing nothing.

After ordering a Sol I placed my order to have the Carnitas tacos served without onions. Chips, salsa and a bean dip were served prior to the meal coming out. The  salsa was amazing and some of the freshest I've had but the bean dip just basically tasted like refried beans.

The Carnitas tacos came out and looked nice on the plate however the plate felt like it was about 150° which likely means it was flash heated to melt cheese. The result was the rice was dried out and the tacos were lacking any real flavor.Yeah.  I am pretty much appalled at this store.  The only reasons to shop here are the selection and prices.

The turn-offs include:
Jerky employees - hard to put my finger on why this store attracts a weird breed of techno-jerk.
Head scratching security annoyances such as needing to always get a supervisor to determine if your cash is authentic.
The stupid long lane of cashiers and having to wait to be told which counter to go to...

Clearly the prices rock - so if you know exactly what you need and are pretty sure you will never need to go back for support, then it is worth a stop.  Personally, I prefer buying things from amazon.com to avoid paying the local taxes.  

Shopping at Frys is like brain-damage.  I will pass if I can help it.Overall the shop is well stocked and displayed nicely- however- they seem to have a problem in controlling maintenance times.  Let me give you an example:

I went in yesterday (Monday after Christmas) in my hand was Reynolds aero rear wheel  that needed a spoke fixed (popped nipple). In the other hand I had cash , I was looking to but a new helmet,clips, etc..   

A salesperson ( young kid)  came to me right away and I asked if I could get this fixed today- his reply.."it will take about a week".. I said a week !!!! he replied "we are really backed up".      (this is not my first experience with them on this issue. I even sent a friend to the shop and this happened to her).. he said "let me go ask to see if it can be done" - a moment later he came back and said "no way it would be a week" .  Feeling rejected and sad as I wanted to ride that day ,  I had no choice to leave and find another shop.    

It was a shame, I like the shop and the owner is very nice and the product is good but they have to get this under control.  I went somewhere else who fixed the tire in under 30 minutes and had the products I was looking for. I walked out spending about $250.. sorry Exhale..maybe in a few months I might try you againI'm so disappointed in this place. The mechanics do good work, but the service writers are a mess. 

My last three visits have all taken 3-4 times longer than quoted because of parts order screw ups.  They even sent me home once after 4 hours because they couldn't finish an oil change, air and fuel filter swap in one visit. That's the easy stuff, guys. 

Today the service writers joked with me about always making me wait, while two mechanics hung around the lobby because they couldn't move forward on half-done jobs. When my car is filling a bay, that means the poor schlump scheduled for the next timeslot isn't getting out of there any time soon. 

I know this location was worried that the train construction was going to kill their business. They should be more worried about their reputation. A new VW mechanic opened up nearby, so don't expect me to be back to Network. Who has the time?


Note on the response from the business: Yeah, I know. That's why I always call a day or two in advance to ask you guys to have the filters. Your organizational issues aren't my fault, and I'm disappointed that I'd be blamed. Sorta makes my point.Very limited menu...can't even split egg whites w one regular egg for omelette . Every other breakfast place does it! No kids menu...not even anything remotely kid friendly.  Prices are ridiculous and fruit is extra! Not coming back!I went there on Halloween night.  Very crowded, difficult to have a chance to actually have a good time.  Will try come back here on a regular night to actually check it out.Let me start by saying the food was delicious and cooked to our liking. However, the portions were very small. Don't come here if you are looking for the "Hungryman" dinner. The service was where our family was greatly disappointed. We waited far too long to receive the next course (15+ minutes) and our waiter was no where to be found, never checking to see how we liked our dinner. My water glass set empty during half the meal until I snagged a busboy to fill it for me. I saw our waiter only once during the meal when he did a "flyby" through his serving area, not making eye contact with any of his tables. We waited and waited to order an after dinner beverage and when it was finally brought to the table, our waiter tried to leave both glasses with the closest person rather than distribute them accordingly. Our waiter shall go nameless here as I do not wish to humiliate openly on the web, but something was not quite right with this guy! Not just his absence, but his actions, speech, facial expressions and demeanor. I think that this establishment needs to reevaluate its hiring/training standards.I love the concept of Ra. The crowd and scene work nicely. However, the sushi is consistently warm. YUK! I have tried to go back several times and to different locations to determine if it was just a bad night, but no such luck. Plus, I have heard this from several other people who won't go back. 

My hope in writing this is that someone from Ra reads it and amps up their sushi attention.The restaurant part & upstairs area looked cute. You can come here to watch people karaoke while sipping on some drinks.After looking at the menu and having a groupon burning in my pocket I was pretty excited to try out Remington's Restaurant.  Unfortunately that's as far as the excitement went as far as dining experience went. 

Pro's:
Location

Con's:
Fly landing on bread bowl
Host's dressed like morgue workers
Food comes out with plastic dome's over it to keep warm but really wasn't too warm anyways
Felt very dated inside 
Server pointed out total before groupon like I was going to stiff him on tip 

Overall I will not be back and wasn't impressed at all.  I guess if you are staying at the resort it's not a bad choice but I'd still go for a quick drive to one of the many other fine establishments within a short distance.We ate at Lon's the evening after our wedding a year ago and had a memorable experience. A year later was a different story. Ambiance is beautiful on the patio. In reality the food is decent. Good quality but the older well established restaurants in Phx are notorious for relying heavily on butter, cream and oil for flavor. If you've lived elsewhere you know what I am referring to. Lon's is no different but does this 'genre' nicely anyhow. We arrived 10 min prior to res on Sunday. I'd made a note on res as to our history, wanting to make this our annual tradition and a 'go-to' spot as we live a 10 min walk away. Gent at front didn't even look up from computer screen and basically said 'just wait a bit.' Thirty minutes after res time we were seated. No offer of drinks in the meantime. Love the ambiance. Food was late, lukewarm, very heavily oiled and salty as heck (salmon and tenderloin). No sincere attempt from Lon's at making this memorable. I did not expect any sort of freebie or handout, just a sincere acknowledgment that someone had taken just a second to read what I had written on our on-line reservation about this special occasion for us. I realize we aren't the only couple to have an anniversary at Lon's but it is special for us and of all the restaurants in the Valley we chose to Lon's in hopes of beginning a long tradition. The server was very nice, Robert I believe. He did welcome us warmly and acknowledged our anniversary and we were happy with his attentiveness.  May give Lon's another try as we all have off nights but not for a special occasion.RA, your food is dependably consistent...most of the time, but why oh why do you provide such slow service. Seriously, of the 15 to 20 times I have eaten here, the servers always disappear...for like 20 minutes. Are they all addicted to cigarettes? Are there company meetings between customers when I visit? Is staff on staff flirting the best use of company time since they don't seem to care about their tips? You may be asking yourself, why do I eat here if the service is so awful? Answer: 1. This is the better Japanese food near my work, 2. the prices are reasonable, 3.hmmm now you have me wondering why...

If you are here for some food and not to get wasted, you're on your hour lunch break, or you actually want to have a nice meal with people you enjoy I would not recommend going to the RA on Mill. Service is unexpected. I have gone in when there are only two or three tables, ordered regular food (not even sushi), then waited for no one since my waiter was nowhere to be found then had to get to go boxes before I could even start eating because it took sooooo long.

If you can make it to another location however, I do like the lunch Bento boxes, great deal for the money. You get Miso (which I don't eat since they use fish) ((*Tip for other vegetarians: their Tempura sauce also contains fish)), uchi no salad (good when made right, I'll even order the full size as my entrée sometimes), rice, a spinach gyoza, a vegetable spring roll, and your entrée. When I ate meat I liked the Chicken Katsu or the Chicken Teriyaki (the sauce is very very light, almost too light though). I also like the Veggie Tempura (I just use a tiny bit of soy for the sauce). They have pineapple cheese wontons which are pretty tasty but I wouldn't order them outside of their happy hour prices. Their spicy chicken teriyaki udon packs a punch and is nose sniffing hot. Make sure to add in the extra red sauce from around the bowl to get the full experience. When I'm in the mood for some sushi I will order cucumber avocado rolls. They actually have a very good dessert...it's tempura fried ice cream (it's big so make sure you have someone to share it with), it's sliced into four pieces and served with a berry sauce.Small rooms, recently updated, make for a comfortable stay. Downtown Scottsdale is a five minute drive. Many sprig training ballparks are an easy drive as well. Friendly staff nice outdoor breakfast area. Be careful of approaching and departing plane noise from Sky Harbor airport. Walls have no insulation. Noise carries easily between rooms. Disappointing stay for a Hilton Diamond member.We have been eating at Monti's since the late '60s, often walking to an ASU football game following our meal. Back in those days, you could count on good service by experienced people and quality food. We don't understand why that has all changed. Rather than older staff who knew their craft, many of the servers are young and seemingly untrained. After a less-than-great dining experience two months ago, we went again last night, to give Mont's another chance. The young woman did not understand our drink order, our meat was tough and not cooked to order. The veggies were very good and people stopped by often to ask how we were doing, but for the price of a steak these days, I expect more than a perky waitress and a historical landmark.Place is rustic and old,  not a bad thing since it is thematic of the restaurant itself. I have no problem with old but dirty is a different story. I must have come in before the annual mopping because the floor was... greasy. A burger and fries came out to be 7.68 or so, a drink would've pushed it to 10. For that money I could go to In n out and get a better burger, fries and drink for 2 people. While the wood fire grill is a unique touch, the burgers are thin and lacking.  I came here under the pretense that this place would have juicy, thick ground Chuck steak patties.  Not the case.  Fries sat under a heat lamp and were dry inside and out,  dusted in Salt.  I will not be back.For some reason, I don't know why, I had heard that Pete's fish and chips was a Tempe staple...if this true I have no idea why.  I mean, sure, the place is extremely well priced (3 of us ate here for less than a Jefferson). But I guess you get what you paid for because when my order arrived I hadn't been so disappointed since the Lost series finale.  The "fish", i guess that's what I ate, was hard as a rock, I was thinking about taking it home to play street hockey with later...it was that bad and it had no flavor what so ever.  Our meals also came with some "shrimp" and again, the dubious quotations are necessary.  I have never ate "shrimp" like that in my life..it was a small amount of shrimp-esque mush fried in a few tablespoons of batter...and it was similarly unflavorful..unless you call grease a flavor, which I do not.Ate the fried oysters, and some BBQ wings. Oysters were pretty good this far out in the desert. The BBQ Ribs were slightly under cooked and a bit to mushy in my opinion. Not a big fan of taking a bite of poultry and getting a vein stuck in my teeth.This place was ruff on my stomach, I got the yellow curry here.  I heard about this place on yelp because me and my friend wanted some chinese food.  

Well the place is clean and my friend said that his dish (Orange Chicken) was just ok,  After I was done eating I felt my stomach screaming 'WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN YOUR FRIEND'.  

There is also a pei wei in the same area and I wish we just went to them because it is a bit better quality then this place.

I even had it a couple hours later after the meal cold, and I dont even know why I just felt like giving it another shot, but nope it was still making my insides hurt.  

Recommendation: I would try somewhere else unless you hate your stomach,and if you do, try something else then the curry.Based on my many trips to Frys Electronics, I can tell you that finding help is nearly impossible; nevermind that they have nearly 10 employees per customer. Also, most everything I have purchsed from them is now broken. One in particular cost me over 1k and was dead in about 3 months - no refunds or exchanges, call the manufacturer...

Unfortunately, I still go there because they are cheaper then best buy and have more things to choose from. Great for window/idea shoppingI gave this a 2 star because the new owner that did my nails, cut my cuticle & it was bleeding.  Was not happy about that, but he did do a good job otherwise.Has is $ 3.11 here today. Not bad.
Pretty decent price on gas for this quick  being one block from the on and off ramp of the 101 there is a low 's, BurgerKing, $.99 store and McDonald's and golds gym on the same road.It's just like any other Chinese place to me. The pork fried rice is ok, like any other place, except there were giant peices of scrambled egg that looked like fried eggs. 
The sesame chicken was not good; nothing to write home about. 
The potstickers were a bit too greasy. Although you get more meat or whatever is in the inside then at any other place.
I think they may deep-fry all their stuff in the same grease because sometimes you could taste a hint of shrimp. 
The egg rolls appear to me to be just like spring rolls that you can buy at Costco and over fried. 
The deliveryman was very, very nice. 
All in all, the food was too salty. 
But the place I love the best only does take-out, not delivery. I  will not order from here again.It's cheap pizza, what can you say. Nothing to write home about. I miss Gheppetos back home. PJ is like dominoes or Pizza Hut. Nothing to great. The bread sticks were pretty good though. Nice and soft.Free Wifi, but half of the restaurants were closed or closed off! WTF! I had a 620 pm flight on Virgin and there were no good restaurants nearby. Wolfgang was randomly closed. The sandwich shop in our area closed at 7pm...we are talking about Vegas...not a teensy tiny airport. I hear the only happening area is the Southwest terminal...I guess all the good stuff is there...oh and the starbucks off the B Virgin Terminal was the slowest ever. 15 min to get a hot tea...waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting just like everything in LV...You would think for being in Vegas that this airport would be as the same as the strip.
Has horrible areas to eat at while waiting for your flight and please, please turn on some air freaking humid...It's been two years since our last trip to Vegas.  This time we flew in on United.  Discovered later on our departure that United is now located in the new Terminal 3.

We checked in our bags and was told by the United ticket agent we needed to go downstairs to security checkpoint and then take the tram to our gate.

We went downstairs and kept walking. There is a security checkpoint but the entire thing was barricaded.  We kept walking and walking.  Then we decided to go upstairs and kept walking and walking.  Then we went back downstairs and kept walking and walking. And upstairs and kept walking and walking.

Finally we saw a huge massive queue and figured that was the line for security checkpoint for Gate D.  We stood in line and walked  in a maze back and forth for 45 minutes until we finally passed through security.

Did we end up going downstairs or upstairs?  We don't know.  We were turned around. And the signs posted didn't help us.  We just ended up where we needed to be.The Golden Nugget is an older hotel/casino on the Fremont Street area in Vegas.  The parking garage was pretty easy to find, with lots of entrance signs.  It's free to park if you're staying at the Nugget but strangely costs to park there otherwise.  Check in was pretty simple but with my room in the Carson Tower it was a pretty long haul from the reception desk to the room.  The room was pretty large and nice in appearance but had some flaws upon examination.  
- No fridge.  
- No free coffeemaker.  
The bed was large and the room was non-smoking but I wasn't able to reserve those things when I made the reservation, I had to wait until check in to actually know that I'd get a non-smoking room.  Pretty lame, in this day and age.  

The bathroom was good sized and pretty modern.  TV was large flat screen but the remote was cantankerous.  The alarm clock was way too complicated, never did figure that thing out.  

Plus: the hotel was pretty quiet during my stay, most smaller hotels seem to be very noisy but this building wasn't.  

For the money, I'd rather stay on the Strip or I'd expect a better room that isn't on the 18th floor.as seen on TV. However, the guys are not always there, typically only when they are filming.

If you want to stop by, go when it's rainy, otherwise you will encounter a LONG line in the blitzing sun to get in.Although it is not a bad hotel, it definitely doesn't deliver the Vegas experience.  Not a lot of young people, more of an older crowd who just wants to gamble and chill. You can take the shuttle to the strip, but it stops pretty early. They have a TGI Fridays which is always good, bowling, theater, and other stuff. But like I said, it doesn't really feel like your in Vegas when at Sams Town.Every time I go to this Jack In The Box I get approached by a homeless person, either inside or outside.

I will stop going to this location. Nothing wrong with the food or service.  

Save for people begging for money.I had the house special chow mein to-go for 8.10.

- a bit better than panda express. pretty bland. 
- small portion for the price. few meat for their combo
- 8.10 for chow mein and their AYCE dinner is10.50? bad pricing. 
- i have to come back to try AYCE. eating individual platters aren't worth it.I've come here twice already. To even it out I gave them 3 stars since my first visit was a 5 and my second visit was a 2. 

OUR FIRST VISIT
couldn't have been better! We came here on a whim one night for dinner when we happened to just be driving around trying to find a place to eat. We walked in here and the place was completely empty, but we were greeted with big smiles and seated right away while another server was already filling up our glasses with water. Usually I find it a little awkward to be the only customers since the servers tend to just stare or or look annoyed and it also seems like the place is empty because it probably isn't good, but that wasn't the case for this place. The fact that we were alone in there actually made it quite nice since we got complete attention and excellent service. 

We ordered the Nevada Chicken - Tender, boneless, chicken breast fillet in a light curry-peanut sauce for $7.95
and
Pad Thai - Soft pan-fried translucent noodles cooked with chicken, shrimp, ground peanuts and ground chili pepper. Garnished with fresh bean sprouts for $7.95

The Nevada Chicken was so sexy! Juicy chicken breast with peanut sauce. It makes me salivate just thinking about it! It was exactly like the description.  It even came with a side of white rice which was nice since we didn't order any rice with our meal. We both loved it!

The Pad Thai I just couldn't get enough of. All of the different flavors and textures in it went together so well in my mouth, mmm! I loved the crunchiness of the peanuts and bean sprouts, it definitely added to the burst of flavors. 

Normally we would've ordered more than just two plates of food, like an appetizer and dessert and probably thai tea, but this was more than enough for us. We were able to finish it all without having to take anything home, which was good since we were staying at a hotel on the strip that night anyway. The portion filled us up just right and we were oh so satisfied!
 

THE SECOND VISIT
Pure disappointment... 

The service was, well, lacking SERVICE. It took them at least 10 minutes to greet us and give us a place to sit. The place wasn't even full, probably just a 3rd of it was full and that was just on the left side where they were seating everyone. Their greeting wasn't exactly welcoming. We were standing at the front of the restaurant waiting to be seated and the girl just came up to us and said "can I help you?" WTH. It's a restaurant, I think it's an obvious reason as to why anyone would be in there, but I wasn't about to say "yes you can help me by filling my stomach and quitting your job so I don't have to see your face again," so I just bit my tongue and said "table for 3." 

We were seated and we decided what to order right away since it was just off the lunch special menu, but it took forever to finally get our order relayed since the waitress just sat us then neglected us. It seemed as though she even avoided us while we were calling her at some points since she'd look at us and just turn away. She finally came and she just seemed to be in another dimension or something. We told her "we want the pepper steak level 4" then she said "okay level 4, what level spicy?" That was just confusing. We went back and forth a few times repeating what level we wanted then she'd repeat that same question. She got the rest of our order and left. 

I don't remember what else we ordered other than pepper steak and pad thai. That might've been it actually. We got to orders of pad thai since my bf and my brother both wanted their order spicy (level 8) and I can't go higher than a 4 lol. 

Since it took so long for the food to come, we decided we wanted to get an appetizer AND we also wanted our glasses of water filled since the cups were already empty for a while and the ice was starting to melt. We kept signaling to the waitress but she's just walk by and look the other way or look at us and look away, it was really awkward, we were beginning to wonder if we were just trippin' or if it was her. We all agreed it was her, ha. Maybe it was just that she was too young and couldn't handle multitasking. Whatever it was definitely didn't leave a good impression on us. 

The pad thai was good, but not great like the first time we went.   The pepper steak I don't even remember, so it mustn't have been all that great. We never  get our appetizer, so I can't comment on that. 

It kinda sucked because my boyfriend and I took my brother here to eat because we had such a good experience with bombass food the first time we came so we thought he'd love it too, but they totally flipped it on us and made it a bad experience with bad service and mediocre food. We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed. He even said it wasn't as good as we were telling him and we told him we didn't expect it to be like this. 

I will not be coming back.I stayed at this hotel as a week from my parents' timeshare.  As far as timeshares go, this is pretty substandard.  I stayed in a one bedroom which was incredibly small compared to one bedrooms I've seen at other timeshare resorts.  The bathroom was tiny with zero counter space, the bedroom barely had enough room to walk around the bed and the closet was smaller than mine at home.  There was no full length mirror in the entire room which is honestly a necessity in a place like Vegas.  The "balcony" was basically just small platform you could stand on.  It was only big enough for one person at a time and no furniture or anything to sit on. 

The pool area was beautiful and got sun all day, which was great for me, but if you're looking for somewhere to actually swim, this isn't the best place for you.  The pool itself is small and is usually filled with children.  There was supposed to be a rule the there were no children allowed at the pool after 5pm.  This rule was not enforced at all, not even after I spoke to multiple people about it.

Basically, this hotel is great If you're looking for a place walking distance to the strip that you can pass out in after coming home drunk at 4am or if you want to tan all day by the pool.  If you're looking for any other sort of activity or enjoyment in your room or at the hotel, go somewhere else.After you've been to Las Vegas for an hour, the glamour wears off.  The arcade below the Excalibur? It makes Chuck E. Cheese look rather classy and educational. There's a metal claw over stuffed animals where you put your quarter in and the claw doesn't even move. It's broken, if not enough to have not taken your money. And you're staring at this metal claw thinking, "Ew, I'm underneath a casino. What smells like swamp water?"

I like Treasure Island.Ook.  Needs a remodel in a BAD way.
Felt childish compared to Mandalay Bay and Luxor (on either side).

I bet kids would like the theme here.

Pro - less expensive than other strip hotels.This is no luxury hotel, the stay was fine, but the service was not respectful. House keeping was sparse and our rooms were never stocked with towels nor were our bed sheets clean. Every now and then they'd be tucked in but still dirty.

I wraped my swimming trunks in a towel which housekeeping removed from the room and they cant find it and refuse to reimburse me for their mistake.

The casino is also garbage, dont gamble here unless you want to loose money.

The free shuttle service is always late by 10-20 minutes.

The luggage service is very nice, that was the only nice part of the hotel.I was pretty disappointed with their front desk customer service.  The lady I had was not very professional at all. The whole time I was trying to talk to her she pretty much not listening to what I was saying and was talking to her co-worker the whole time which I taught was very rude.  That made my whole evening pretty upsetting. When I got to the room the lamp and TV remote was not working and it took them until the next day before I got replacement. The hotel use to be so nice when I was a diamond player and since I have not been there a long time I started from the bottom again which was fine but I cannot believe how that person treated me.i nicknamed this "resort" the Shits Carlton!!!

 i decided to drive, last-minute, to Vegas on saturday night on Memorial Day weekend....so as you might expect, there wern't a great deal of rooms available.  so we decided to stay at Circus Circus. Jesus Christ. 

1. when we got there they had given away our room....so they "upgraded" us for free.....when we got to our room and discovered it was exactly what you'd expect from a motel 6 (basic meat and potatoes room)  we shuttered to think that it was an "upgrade"....WHAT KIND OF GHETTO-ASS ROOM WERE YOU PLANNING ON PUTTING ME IN?!?!

2. The Pool....70% Urine, 20% Water, 10% miscellaneous!!!  i'm serious, it had a green tint and was full of children, who i witnessed drink 11 juice boxes, a piece, and NEVER take a bathroom break; do the math.  when i go to Vegas, one of my FAVORITE things to do is hang at the pool all day....not here, no way, i wasn't dipping my fucking toe in that water!

3. CLOWNS!!!! THE PLACE IS FUCKING CIRCUS THEMED!!! COME ON!!!

4. The worst part about staying somewhere EVERYONE can afford isn't the quality...it's the fact that EVERYONE can afford it, SO THEY'LL BE THERE!  Just to go from one end of the casino to the other i'd have to wade through LITTER ALLY 30 minutes of white trash, and, 200 year-old Asian ladies who are always confused, etc.  (if that wasn't PC, forgive me, but i just got back).  This place is OVERCROWDED with people that don't wear deodorant, sleeves or shoes!!!

5. The floor is sticky, so are the walls...DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING

6. It'd be fine if it was geared for low-income grownups, but its not....its geared for FAMILIES!  THE PLACE IS A FUCKING CHUCK-E-CHEESE!!!! So the gift shops aren't full of cool shit like at most casinos (like crystal statues, shot glasses, etc)  its full of stuffed animals and toys....the kind of shit you see at swap meet!


7. our maid keyed into the room without asking, and WITHOUT A WORD began searching the room for her cell phone.  now i want you to imagine that.  you are standing there talking to your friend, in your hotel room, in the middle of the day.  SUDDENLY the lock clicks, the door opens, and a small mexican lady just starts combing your belongings without even looking at you.  you try and say "excuse me, can i help you?" and her reply, while lifting up your luggage and looking under it is "cell phone"  .....seriously?

if its between this place and not going to Vegas...Don't go.So my parents asked me if I wanted to go to Vegas with them and the kids. I said fuck it- yes. So I wake up from the 9 hour car ride and I'm like how much longer til the Sahara.. they go oh yeah about that were staying at circus circus. Suddenly my mind is spinning, creepy clowns, small children, rollercoasters. GET ME OUT OF HERE. but then I realized it's also a casino and theres bars.. saving grace. So we roll in, wait 30 minutes to check in, get our rooms, not too bad, but the sink didn't work.(but a repair man was up there within 20 min) But honestly for how cheap it was (like 100 a night on CES weekend) it was a good deal. I think I only got like one bedbug bite. And im not kidding.

The restaurants there were ok- it's vegas so it's super over priced and very tacky if it doesn't have a celeb chef. BEST DEAL EVER though: $2 bloody marys or margaritas, and $ 2 shrimp cocktail or chips n salsa 2am-2pm, how can you go wrong? and $6.50 for don julio shots, all at the "Garden Grill". Now another great deal, the buffet.. so for like $25-30 you can eat all you can eat bfast, lunch n dinner, just beware of what time it's closed at. I missed a meal being hungover and lazy. The foods ok, it's just a really good deal in vegas.  I seriously ate there like 5 times. and if i needed a soda, or anything i'd just go right in. It's a hook up when you want to have $$ for shopping or gambling, $30 a day on food is a good idea. Now when you gain 10 pounds, don't blame me.

So we had kids with us, a 12 year old and 2 year old. Lots to do for them at this place. Honeslty unless you have kids or have been coming to vegas since it was becoming popular you wouldn't want to stay at circus. no clubs. closest night life party happenings would be like the rivieara (pass) encore and wynn (unless I win big i can't even fathom entering those doors for more than a cocktail and a ooooh ahh), and then you have to walk to TI.(which smells like a christian audieger brotherl). it's just kinda weak. 

But anyways in the hallways leading from the casino to the towers.. theres those kiosk things. and those people who attack you as you walk by. Now i say attack and not approach because I maybe walked the hallways 5 times a day for 4 days and i was harassed "where you from" "oh your skin, try this" "want a massage" and it was the same shit everytime. so finally this one bitch (*for the third time that day, and honestly they could tell me apart from the other clientel, they had seen me all day, leave me alone), shes all "where you from" and i couldn't help but ever so maturly respond "uranus". After that they fucked off.

the floor has great slots. When it comes to slot play im all about the ghetto casinos. and they have my favorite top dollar machines. they rock. I wouldn't be caught dead playing a table at circus, but that's just me. 

Adventuredome: kinda lame, but as far as people under 21 are concerned, it's kinda where it's at in vegas for them.

midway: rip off, but super fun for kids. Don't be suprised when after 30 minutes you've gone through $60 on games and you have defective looking stuffed animals in your hands.


would i stay here again, hopefully not.i almost feel bad giving this place 2-stars...i mean its a given that its only worth 2 stars and any and everyone who books here should know not to expect much...that being said.. i'm still giving it two stars haha. definitely brought back a lot of memories of random trips to vegas with my family when i was a little kid, but its definitely aged and not as fun and exciting as i remember it. haha. 

while i have indeed experienced much better, comparing this hotel to the other low budget hotels in vegas, it wasnt too bad at all. its definitely really crowded, but the front desk agents move pretty quickly and check in was smooth and quick.  we did have a little trouble finding our rooms because we thought we were in the manor rooms (which are separate from the hotel and have its own parking lot), but we were actually in the tower, so we did quite a bit of walking back and forth. haha but that was our fault.

the room itself is pretty ghetto, but i mean for $20 a night, it definitely served its purpose for our one night spontaneous trip to vegas with my friends and it was fairly clean. im glad i can now say that ive stayed at some of the best.. and some of the not so great.. hotels. really makes you appreciate putting in that extra $30 to stay somewhere nicer.  but it IS really close to the wynn/encore, which is where i find myself partying all the time, so cab fare is cheap!Was looking for something cheap to spend one more night in vegas. 30$ for 1 night. Cannot beat that. My room was better that expected, mostly clean. I was in room 2508 in building C of a section called the circus manor. Feels a little bit like a concentration camp. Biggest negative point: you are at the far end of the strip and have to take a bus or walk 30 minutes to get to the center of the strip.There was a strange odor when you walked in from one entrance . The hotel is fine for a quick little stay and always very busy . The staff was friendly but if you have the money try to stay closer on the strip . The pool was a tad bit boring and its very a family orientated hotel . So if you with your girl then you may not enjoy the pool . There really wasn't much to the stay but a decent hotel bed . It all depends what you are looking for when you stay .I will rate 1. Hotel, 2. Casino, 3. Kids venue, 4. Overall quality
1. Hotel rooms are okay 3.5 stars. The elevator system gets (1-generous heavy weighted star). We stay here every year and its the same thing every year. When 10:30 to 11 AM rolls around, everybody is trying to get out of the building, however the elevators are so slow that it takes 40-minutes to get down. By the time it gets to your floor they are already full. If you don't have luggage, take the stairs, but if you do, prepare to wait for a ride and stop on every floor.!! THE ELEVATORS SUCK.!!!!!
2. Smokey Casino is okay, nothin special, 3-stars.
3. (2-stars) The smokey mid-way is old and could use a overhaul, but my 5-year old son knows no difference and loves it. The circus acts are entertaining too, this is why we come back every year. Very crowded so get used to bumping into folks. Adventure dome is fun too, but pricy. (Not smokey) The rides seem a little old and a little young for my 5-year old, so we didn't spend much time there this year. (3-stars).
4. Overall, this place is okay (2-stars), very smokey, pricy food, dirty, old; nice upgraded rooms but getting out during checkout time is a challenge because of the  HORRIBLE ELEVATOR  system. Circus Circus gets a well deserved 2-stars mostly because of the smokey venue and horrible elevators.We were VERY disappointed.  The customer services to TOP NOTCH but the food was OK. I'm glad we experienced Battista's but we will not return.This place is no longer was it once was. No more fun thrills and cheap food. I remember going in there it was ALWAYS crowded, even people overflowed onto the sidewalk. Their famous $2 Heinekens and $1 half pound hot dogs and shrimp coctails.. and the best of all were real dealers at the blackjack and roulette tables. It's all been replaced. Video blackjack and video roulette. Where's the fun in that? No more cheap beer or food either, just a subway and Nathan's. And worst of all it's deserted now.. it was one of the last old school feel places and now that feeling is gone!Older casino on the strip.  If you are going to the strip, you should hit the big flashier casino to get the full Vegas experience.  But if you are going for a smaller laid back feel, you might as well hit one of the local Station casinos or The Orleans.  Cleaner and more up to date.  This casino definitely looks like old school 'has been'.  It needs some serious updating.Meh... They're just OK.. I got their pull pork sandwich, wasn't much flavor going on. I had to add in hot sauce to make it taste like something! Service was pretty slow, it wasn't even that busy at all! I had better, that's all I had to say!personally i would prefer In-and-Out Burgers but the line at the In-and-Out's drive-thru was terrible so I stopped by Fatburger to get my burger fix.  Sadly, I had to wait 20 minutes for just one (1) chicken burger and some Fat Fries to be made, while the restaurant was widely empty!  I didnt understand what took the kitchen so long to assemble a burger, but service was just super slow. period.  

Would I go back?  Nope! The Hawaiian chicken burger was just alright and the Fat Fries were meh.....meaning that both were soooooo not worth the wait!!!  Price was not cheap; total 14 bucks. GRRRRRRRRRR i felt furious.In my opinion I thought this place would have been a little more interesting. It was just a shop full of items to buy that were pretty pricey. If you're a huge fan of M&Ms and want some M&M accessories then maybe you should go here. I'm not a huge fan of M&Ms though, so I wouldn't really want to waste my time here. I think the place is pretty cool how it's fully M&M themed and they also let you watch a free 10 minute movie. It's pretty cute how the kids react to it! :) But yeah I wouldn't recommend this place as a tourist attraction.This is the only buffet in NYNY.  It's only for breakfast and something of an odd combination.  

For starters it was $30 for two, not bad for a Vegas buffet.  That is until you see the offerings.  Strange pairings of eggs so firm they were more sliced than scooped, with BBQ pork loin for breakfast?  There were unusual items like pot-stickers and egg -fu-yung on the breakfast buffet.  

The strange and small assortment of items left us not wanting to return, and we didn't.

The 2 stars instead of 1 star was solely because the staff kept our cups full.HAHA to this place cause it was a joke. If your a perv or a western twang, this is a perfect place for  you!

Stayed about 15 min and had to bounce. We looked waaaaay to nice LOL. For the suckers who have paid to get in this joint, I feel bad!

(BTW, the "free shots for ladies" are in the mixed bottles in the hands of the girls! bottoms up!)Food is great! Unfortunatly the service isn't. Only 1 person serving meat not like others where there are 5 or 6 people serving. They better improve there game! Fogo di Chao is opening across the street! This place better improve on service! We went the following week to Texas de Brazil, what a difference! I like people to try Texas de Brazil or even Fogo di Chao and try to come back here! Food is ok here, there banannas are the best here out of anyone so far in Vegas, but the downside is you only get 1. I can unfortunatly see this business go out of business maybe with-in the next year if there lucky 2 years. Reason of this would be because of Texas de Braizil and now Fogo di Chao. They would count on visitors that don't know better to eat at Yolies. But locals and returning customers would go to Via Brazil, Texas de Brazil, or Fogo di Chao, or even Sambas at the Mirage.
It's just sad to see a business run down in service, quaility and even the decore. Even if they improve on service and have good selections of meat, they won't be able to compete with the top 4 Brazilian Resturants in town. The food is good but now there are better places, it's not the 80's or 90's anymore where this was the only thing.Thoroughly unimpressed.The Costco of Vegas strip clubs.  I think the problem with the size of this place is it feels impersonal and you don't really benefit from the size - in other words, that hot stripper lap dancing on that guy 200 feet away, you're not really seeing that, the quantity of strippers and space does not impact the quality of your experience there, it doesn't make it any sexier.  

SR is closer and better, OG is smaller and closer and about the same pricewise, Scores has better looking girls.

This place would make a great ice skating rink.  Topless ice skating rink?To give it two stars is being generous.  I don't even feel like reviewing this place.  The only reason we had so much fun being here is because we ignored all the negative stuff and just climbed.

I'll just make this brief.

1.)  It smells like socks and dirty shoes.  The ventilation is not very good and if you're there for hours, maybe you'll just get used to the stench.

2.)  The receptionist was not helpful, condescending, and acted like helping us was too much out of the way.  Probably just got used to regulars and is very nice to them.  But to newbies, forget it.  My cousin is the nicest guy you could ever meet and will even go out of his way to buy food for the poor.  He just wasn't worth the time to be given good service to I think.

I think if the smell wasn't so bad and if service was better I would recommend people to come here or myself to come here to have fun.The service and ambiance deserved only one star.  They food was actually pretty good which is the only reason I didn't give it one star.  
The people in my group ordered the ribeye and thoroughly enjoyed the ribeye and the gnocci.  There was a seafood linguine dish that was enjoyed as well.

As for the ambiance, the lighting was absolutely horrible and then through the dinner the light flickered and then there was dimming of the lights.  You figured they'd have the lighting figured out by now.

The service was the worst part of my visit.  When I pay this much for dinner, I expect the food to be good but I'm also expecting for some high quality service.  The place wasn't even half full so they can't even use the excuse that it was a busy night for the poor service.

1. When we first sat down, we were given a wine list and it probably took almost 20 minutes before we were given a dinner menu.  And when we were given the dinner menu, we were told about the specials in 2 sentences and no explanation of the specials.

2. I asked the waiter for if there were any bottles of syrah.  He looked absolutely clueless and pointed out the SHIRAZ rather than the SYRAH and said that's all that he knew they had.  After he left, I flipped a couple pages and found that there was a whole listing of SYRAH's.  

3. The service overall was slow

4.  We complained to the manager and he seemed to give an insincere apology and I didn't get the sense that he was even really listening to us.

Needless to say, I won't be back.This place was not very good. I went here with my girlfriend who is from Florida. She constantly reminded me that "this place isn't real barbecue".

We ordered the 4 meat 2 side combo. It sounds like a lot, but it wasn't. Everything was just OK. It wasnt horrible. But its just generic barbecue. The brisket was good. Ribs we're ok. Chicken was just ok and the pulled pork was sub-par. It basically was like famous daves. Nothing stood out. The service was good, the food just didn't do much for me.After multiple visits, I've come to realize: don't believe the hype.

 The food and service is really hit or miss. The sushi is OK, but not the freshest or tastiest fish at all. The service went from "Meh" the first time to terrible on my last visit. Our server could not place orders correctly, and only half our food came out. When we brought up the issues to another server, after much deliberation, silence, and more waiting, our sushi chef sent us home with the rolls he made for us that we never ordered or wanted. 

If you are going, and want some sashimi order the seafood salad, $10 isn't too bad.Sushimon is greater than Yama sushi.

Service sucks - waitress = rude
Tuna (Saku tuna from Walmart) sucks
Dining area sucks

Although it is the cheapest AYCE dinner sushi in Vegas, you get what you pay for. Their hamachi was decent so that's why i gave this place 2 stars. I ordered uni first, it was not until the 4th time I ordered they told me they ran out... Spend the extra 2 dollars and headway somewhere else.I went with a coupon for essentially 50% off the meal, the only way I will ever eat here again is if it is free. Had one of those moments where you were you wonder when your waiter will take the drink order. The steaks were just OK nothing special, over cooked, I would order one level below what you normally would, about what you can do at home with steak from walmart. 

The sides however were amazing and what saved me from giving this place one star, also the included salad and soup bar is good and worth noting. 

Staff need training on proper etiquette and professionalism. We overheard two of the staff members making little comments about "the gay couple" totally ruined our meal.A few people had recommended this place for all you can eat sushi, so I was looking forward to it. This was the fourth all you can eat sushi place I have tried in Vegas. Honestly, I was really disappointed. The tables are almost stacked on top of each other when you are seated. I could have rubbed elbows with the table next to me. The fish was not fresh when I was there, which was a big bummer. I'm not sure why everyone is raving about the menu selection, because this place had the smallest selection of the 4 I have been to. They are quick to get the rolls out to you, but quick isn't always good. The quality definitely wasn't there. I think most people like this place because it's convenient, but outside of that you should go elsewhere.My main riff with this place is that it is IMPOSSIBLE find a cocktail waitress.. We would have been better off using the water fountain waiting on them. Other than that, its an ok place, alot of older people there but nice. Rampart, we spend a lil more when we've had a few drinks, you guys know that though.  ;o)Had the corned beef hash and eggs over medium.  Eggs were cooked perfectly and were delicious.  No complaints there.  
But the corned beef hash wasn't flavorful.  Just salted heavily but none of the delicious flavor you expect from a good corned beef.  Just tasted like salt.
Had the pot of bread...I like that it's hot and such but it wasn't very flavorful either.  Just seemed like plain white bread.  Didn't get the yeasty flavor other people liked.
Service was great and the staff super friendly.I'd rather be at McMullans!!  Nothing this place does is better or even to par as that place.Skip the sushi and stick to cooked food and rolls.

We had just come from watching a movie and were starving. We were looking for some quick and cheap grub and I remembered this Kobe location that was near us. I have been to the one on Rainbow on numerous times, but this was my visit here. I knew they have a Happy Hour that pretty much lasts all day, so it made our decision easy. 

The restaurant was pretty empty, but filled up while we were there. I took quite a while perusing the menu. The entire menu is half price during Happy Hour I decided on bento box since it seemed like the best value. My fella ordered some rolls and appetizer as did our friend. My other friend decided on a bento box as well. 

Our food came quickly. The portions were large and I was happy with most of the cooked things in my bento box. The katsu was pretty good and not overcooked, the salad was pretty fresh as well. My fella didn't enjoy his rolls so I ended up trading a majority of my bento box for his roll since I liked it better than he did. The spicy tuna was spicy but not as fresh and fell apart quite easily. The sashimi was not fresh at all. The flavor was really fishy and I ended up not eating this portion of my meal. My friends and fella were pretty meh about the dining experience as well. The prices were right, but I don't think I'll be back to this Kobe location.I had such high hopes for this place. I was in Vegas with my husband and in-laws to have a sin city Christmas. We decided to try Hikari for the AYCE sushi as our Christmas Eve dinner. While our waitress was super sweet and friendly, it didn't make up for the poor service we received over the entire evening. First, we sat down and were asked what we would like to drink (4 hot teas and 4 glasses of water, please) and we excitedly gave the waitress our marked up sushi order so we can get our food ASAP.

10+ minutes pass by and... nothing. The waitress frantically returns and tells us that they must' have lost our sushi order. WHAT. So she asked us to repeat our order by memory, which was really confusing for a second, until I asked her for another menu to look at so we can try to remember. Jeez.

10 minutes later, a big tray of sushi is dropped off by another waitress and is left at the empty side of the counter. We sit and stare at the tray of our sushi for another 10 minutes before our original waitress comes back and brings it to us. I would've served us ourselves, but we weren't sure it was even our food. It was just left there.

As for the food, it was decent. The fried rice and soup were standard but yummy. The rolls were pretty good (I liked the Win Roll... fried with jalapenos) and the sushi and sashimi were just ok. They were cut all weird like they had just been hacked up. I've never seen such poorly cut sushi & sashimi before. And it didn't really taste all that fresh. I know it's not like I expected the freshest and bestest sushi & sashimi ever. But c'mon.

Sad to say I arrived with high hopes and left really frustrated and unsatisfied. I will not be a return customer.

Side note: the chefs put raw meat & seafood on the trays when they do the teppan style dinner. No plates or anything. Just raw chicken, shrimp, and steaks on plastic lunch trays. The same trays they bring out your other food on. I hope they wash those with really hot water. Ew.Normally love Baja, but this one has been very disappointing. Shrimp tacos, taste like rubber. All but one salsa was worth eating. Beans are a no go, and rice was average. My suggestion, don't let this be your first experience a Baja Fresh, go to another location, they do have good food!It was a bright and shinny afternoon when I strolled into the darken cavern that is Richardson's for an early dinner.   With only 1 other table occupied, the waitress staunchly refused to seat me until my entire party arrives --- in this case, the 2 other people that would double the current occupancy level of the restaurant.  

I am getting an inkling that this may not be the pleasant dinning experience that I was hoping for.  After 10 minutes of cooling my heels on the hot asphalt lot, my wayward friends arrived and we were granted permission to sit.  

The menu had odd notes of randomness...Chicken Cordon Bleu...really?  We ended up ordering New Mexico Sausages, Carne Asovada and the Relleno Platter.  The sausages were the best of the lot.  While the relleno was decent, it wasn't anything worth walking the hot parking lot for.  As for the Carne Asovada, the flavoring was so subtle that we couldn't actually taste any...ended up asking for chile sauce.  It took some effort to flag down the waitress since the occupancy level doubled yet again (meaning there is now ~ 10 customers in the restaurant)...but finally, the waitress got us 2 house-made sauces in tiny bowls.  The sauces were okay and did improve the flavor the pork (especially since it was completely bland before)...but any remaining iota of good will from this better-late-than-never gesture was completely banished when we got the bill and realized that we were charged for each of these 2 additional sauces.    
 
Did the so-call cool quotient or the slightly above average food made up for the service?  I don't think so.  But hey if you're feeling masochistic and want to pay to be treated badly then head on over to Richardson.  

Would have given 3 stars for the food alone.Last night my wife and I went to the GPCR because we'd heard from someone that it was very good.  It was sort of a mixed bag.  The service was good.  Wait staff spoke English and were quite competent.  Atmosphere was very impressive.   We had an appitizer of eggrolls.  I had sweet and sour pork and my wife had cashew chicken.  The egg rolls arrived and the presentation was lovely.  They were a bit overcooked but cooked in a very heavy tasting oil that covered up the taste of the egg roll.  Perhaps the oil had needed changing.  Perhaps it was the wrong kind of oil.. it certainly wasn't light tasting.  Anyway, it covered up the taste of the egg rolls.  The sweet and sour pork arrived and again the same thing.  The pork was cooked in the same heavy tasting oil that smothered the taste of the dish.  The sauce was the same sauce as that which came with the egg rolls.  The whole dish cried for something to carry it above the grease taste.  I used a lot of salt trying find some way to save it.
My wife's chicken cashew came and because it wasn't fried in grease, tasted alot better.  She felt it was very good although a bit bland.  We both decided that there were too many other restaurants in the area to give this place a second chance.  We both decided that decor deserved an A+.  Service deserved an A and food quality was between a C and an F depending on what you order.Came here to try the Chili Dip but I ordered the wrong one instead :(. Everything was too salty for my taste. Service was very attentive. 

Nam Kao Tod - salty. need more acidy

Beef soup - very good and flavorful but a little over season 

Northern Curry - salty also. I had this curry better somewhere else.Jasmine's saving grace is its fortunate view of the Bellagio fountains, but aside from that it's just a typical, overpriced Strip restaurant.  My party got an assortment of dishes, including the Dim Sum trio, crispy walnut prawns, general chicken, and kung pao chicken, which will be dissected below.

The General Chicken was named pretty accurately, it was very "General" in nature.  Not a lot of flavor and could have been whipped up by an amateur chef with simple ingredients.  The crispy walnut shrimp was simply not up to par - I've had better quality and flavor from Panda Express.  Kung Pao chicken was OK, but still nothing to write home about.

Dim Sum trio was a straight up ripoff... I'm sorry, but if we knew THREE (yes, 3) dumplings would have costed us $18.88, we probably wouldn't have ordered them.  Said dumplings were also very run of the mill in quality and flavor.  

Service was pretty good, but was honestly expected for the price gouging we endured here.For a celebrity chef restaurant I was very disappointed. From the moment we arrived our party was treated poorly. We had a large group and were told we couldn't split the  bill evenly, even though it  was clearly written on the menu: happy to split any bill up to 4 ways. Then we had to wait over an hour for our entrees. Can't say we will be returning anytime soon!Our hotel concierge recommended this place.  We sat outside under the heating lamps and the vibe was great.  The appetizers were quite tasty (seafood tacos were yummy while the chorizo fondue was not what we expected but still okay).   The entrees were not that great.  We only had to wait 5 minutes, but then it was also a Sunday night.   Portions are pretty large... we ended up doggy bagging half our entrees.With ever trip to Vegas, I've marveled at how gorgeous Bellagio looked from the outside.  On my last Vegas trip, I finally stayed here as a hotel guest and I was disappointed at the room cleanliness and hotel staff service.  With any 5-star hotels, the service at the check-in is crucial because it is the first impression (based on interaction) guests get of the hotel staff.  I felt like I was checking into a Holiday Inn; it was very casual and unimportant.  

When I got into the hotel room, there was a red stain on one of the blankets and so they came up to remove it from the room and said that they will replace it tomorrow (why the wait? I have no idea).  It took 3 staff members to take the blanket away and they didn't address the concern of cleanliness at all.  I gotta say that I'm surprised to see this listed as one of the 5-star hotels because it is only a 4-star in my book.  The rates at Bellagio are not competitive with other hotels with similar amenities and class, so I wouldn't choose to stay here again.  For a much better experience, I would recommend the Palazzo, Wynn or Encore resorts.My lord has this place changed!  Use to come here all the time. They were sold 4-5 years back, so I thought. Seems they are bank owned now. 

Use to have limo pick up with no problem. Well, my host arranged for it, but he put the wrong pick up time. Once the driver got there he was apologetic and explained the confusion. 

I went to check in and VIP check in was closed. I checked in the normal line and no comp card or tournament info was given to me. I asked asked and they were clueless. 

Hope they get it all figured out. Thi place use to be great. Games now suck, but I still get offers for free room and food, which is a good deal. 

I stopped by on my way back from Cali. I'm in the free tournament, I think. I'll find out around 9am. 

Overall, cheap place to stay with Mono rail service to the strip, or a short walk for the adventurous ones out there.This place was only $18.00 for the one night I stayed here, it is not worth one penny more.

The wait to check-in was over an hour, on Tuesday, at midnight. The room furnishings were old, out dated and uncomfortable.  The bed was hard and uncomfortable. Service was okay. The air conditioning did not work.  The shower water pressure was low and not hot.  Bathroom linens old and worn out.  Bed linens looked like they have been used since the 1970's.Took my girlfriend here for her birthday. Food was fantastic. A little pricey but, again, it tastes wonderful. Try the fish collar!

Service was awful. Half of our sushi order and the vegetable tempura were not delivered. Our waiter said we should have revived it with the rest of our order. He apologized but it took 30 minutes for him to get to our table to see if we received everything. All we received was an empty apology.Dated Gaudy old den look for the room was not what I expected. Many amenities I would expect from a old motor lodge in the middle of nowhere-ville.. Definitely Not worth the price, I'll be back at Palms place next visit.This has become the hip hop hotel on the strip. If you're into that you'll love it here, otherwise stay away. I had dinner at Hecha en Las Vegas. That was about the worst Mexican I ever had. Rooms were nice, pools were fine, not too crowded. 

It seems MGM is trying to brand itself toward a younger, high energy, party crowd. So there is constant loud tween music in elevators, casino floor and pool area. The clientele have become a bit more low class.

Not to mention the stampede after an alleged shooting right after the Mayweather fight.The Coffee Shop service is slow. Don't waste your time on the burger it was a disaster. Overall the place is ok but it's low class compared to neighboring casinos. I probably wont stay here again.Oh yeah, it's pretty dingy.  It smells like cigarettes downstairs and the elevators take forever, and it's got some weird esclator business going on.  What's awesome about it is that it's cheap and it's centrally located on the strip.  The hotel rooms aren't that bad either...except ours was close enough to hear (and feel the pounding of) the music from the hotel's bar (Rockhouse, I think it's called) so it was hard to nap in the afternoon.  

Oh, by the way, there's a KARAOKE BAR!!!  Unfortunately, the wait was too long so we didn't get a chance to sing, but it seemed pretty fun...Got here yesterday and found our room. Flipped on the TV and found that there's no show guide
...just a list of channels. I guess if you plan on watching porn all night it doesn't matter what's on TNT. Flipped on the lights and found that one didn't work. The maintenance guy, who was nice as hell, tried the bulb...didn't work. Rewired the lamp, didn't work. Replaced the plug, still didn't work.  Finally he looked at the cord itself and found that someone stripped the copper out of the cord. Really? I guess they needed to pay for the $12 pot of coffee. The room had stains on the carpet and ceiling. The people at the front desk were also very nice and helpful. I think they put us apart from other guests because it was nice and quiet when it comes to people ...we had the parking garage outside and a car had a sensitive alarm. The 'character' the room had is negligible to me since I don't look at it while I'm asleep. I say average for a hotel, below average for one on the Las Vegas strip.We stayed at the Flamingo over New Years and paid an OBSCENE amount of money for our room. I get it, every hotel room in Vegas goes up 10x on NYE, but that doesn't make me any less bitter. The Go rooms were sold out so we were stuck in one of the normal rooms. They were, well, crap. Big enough, but sparse and a little sad. Worse, the rooms had the worst insulation ever - we could hear the guy next door recapping his shaving can. For real?! The whole place smelled funny. The only redeeming part of that stay was the super nice valet guy. We didn't take out cash because the ATM fee was $5(!!!!) and they refused to cash our check and give us money so we could tip their own staff. We profusely apologized to the valet for not having a tip for him, and he was so freaking gracious and sweet about it. Nicest guy ever. He's the only thing keeping this review from 1 star.Nice downstairs....

Room was pretty beat-down, and I thought they re-did them not too long ago.  Carpet was bumpy all over the floor to our room, and bathroom... well, it needed a LOT of work.  Peeling paint, rust, nicks, etc....

Thanks for the cheap room and great location, but damn, there's nicer Motel 6's.Having stayed in the "new" rooms I have to say the rooms are on par with everything else. Nothing special but they are a hike from the hotel into the "new" area. 

Beyond the room I really have no reason to stay here. Limited to no shops to look at, the food court is no better than what they have at your average mall and they are very limited with what they have for additional restaurants. Night life here flat out sucks. LAX is one of the worst clubs on the strip that will cost an arm and leg to get into and if you don't feel like doing that you'll end up at their lame hotel bar. 

The worst part about this place is trying to walk through the hotel and being hustled by their timeshare people. I feel like I am being sold timeshares or show tickets at every bend and its flat out annoying.Luxor, you disappoint me.  This is a an aging property on the south end of the strip and while I've stayed there three times, the prior time being the most pleasant, it is really in a tired state.

We had an incredibly poor experience with the Shelly, the gal at the check in desk, the YS detailed it in his review so I won't bring it up again and that's how it started.,with incredibly poor customer service.

It used to be, too, that they had security near the hallways watching who went up and down in the elevators in the towers, that is no more and also you are no longer required to use a room key to operate the elevator so that means any and all can use it at all hours.  A fact I was not pleased to hear.  Shelly didn't tell us about that someone else a day or so later told us when we couldn't make the key work in the elevator.

I dislike greatly the timeshare people that they allow on their property that hound you every time you walk by, however, we must have gotten better at dodging them or they are slipping because it was minimal hounding.  

All in all, I'll try a newer property elsewhere on the strip.  I've recently stayed at the Encore and that was a much nicer experience.

The Cosmopolitan interests me as well.  It's definitely in the newer nicer property list.

I usually say I'll be back but don't bet on it.I checked in my 15th floor room, was good with nice view, yesterday. Then this morning, the ants swarmed the room. So they moved me to the suite on the 2nd floor with windows facing the big wall of next building.

About WiFi.... There is NONE! Just wired ethernet which is NOT long enough to reach the sofa in the living room. To use the ethernet, you need to stand up and put your laptop next to the TV...

On my next trip, I will stay at other hotel.Looks way nicer on the outside. The room I was in was very dark and there was very little ventilation in the bedroom and none what so ever in the bathroom. Also what was very frustrating was that after 12am it seemed like there was nowhere to get anything to eat. And the one place I did find that was 24hrs had run out of pretty much everything. Wouldn't stay there again. Maybe just to visit the pool for the day but that is it.I give this joint two stars, mainly for service.  Staff wasn't overly friendly, but they were attentive and efficient.  Zero stars for food.  Chips were ok, but only one of the three salsas they brought was tasty.  It seemed like they were trying to be original with their unique salsas, but something just went wrong and they weren't good.  I had the Baja fish tacos, which were the worst I've ever had.  The fish was ok, but bland.  The tortillas were pasty, like they were undercooked.  The rice could have been Rice-a-Roni, but it wasn't even that good.  The beans were the one thing I ate most of.  My friend had fajitas, and the meat was tough.  They brought her tortillas wrapped up in a cloth napkin, that kept them warm for about two minutes.  All that combined with weird lighting, which gave the place a cool atmosphere but made the food look even less appetizing (a green light right above the table?) just made the entire experience bad.  I won't try this place again.Let me start off with this place used to be great! Sadly they're now trading on their name and the quality has dropped off tremendously. They offer these three salsas with the chips you get when you sit down and my wife and I used to destroy them all. The last time we went in (about a month ago) was because my wife was jonesin' for some good chips and salsa and we couldn't be more disappointed. The salsas were bland, watery and lacked any unique taste. We asked the server and she said about six or seven months ago that they changed the recipe. I've always been a fan of the sabano de pollo. It was extremely rich but extremely juicy and flavorful. I used to think this is how a fat kid with a cake on his birthday feels. It was good this time around, and it may have been as good as in times past but I just couldn't get over the betrayal of the cheapening of the ingredients. 
House margaritas are solid, and service is good.Came for dinner on a weeknight. Luckily there was no wait, and the decor/ambience are absolutely gorgeous in a classic, old world charm sort of way -- tucked away on an upper floor in the Venetian, it's a welcome change of scenery compared to Vegas' other fine dining establishments that have a not so discreet view of the casino floor, and yet you're still in the midst of the action on the strip. Unfortunately, the positives of my experience at Bouchon end here.

Service was god awful -- inattentive, unaccommodating, and generally disinterested in making my evening a pleasant one. After being completely ignored for 15 minutes upon being seated, I got up to use the restroom only to find that my table setting had been cleared away by the time I returned. No apology whatsoever. When I finally got my waiter's attention after another 15 minutes of being ignored, he didn't bother to walk me through the menu or the special of the day, and he was unwilling to help me choose a dish/work with the kitchen to prepare something that would suit my not uncommon dietary restrictions. I finally settled for the trout, although at that point I shouldn't have bothered. The dish was just as bad as the service: the fish was entirely unseasoned and flavorless, and the rudimentary, unmemorable cauliflower amandine felt like an afterthought thrown on top. What the plate lacked in flavor it more than compensated for with a completely gratuitous amount of added fat: as if being served in the veritable pool of butter in which it was pan-fried wasn't enough, the top of the filet was slathered in enough oil for the trout to positively swim in (if it wasn't already fileted down the middle). FYI Mr. Keller: oil is not a substitute for flavor!

Blegh -- meal was such a disappointment that I wasn't even interested in taking the 15% off coupon for the similarly mediocre bakery. Next time I remotely consider patronizing Thomas Keller, it's French Laundry or bust.We're staying at Ceasar's palace and decided to walk over to try the breakfast due to all the good reviews, big mistake.

When you walk into the shoppes at the Venetian, you will be stopped by tour salespeople every 5 mins trying to sell you something.  It's like when you exit the airport in Cancun or Cabo and you're bumrushed by timeshare sharks.  Then you have to walkthru their rooms on the 4th floor to the spa, that's where the cafe is, in the spa.

As if that's not ingenious itself, there's no wait service.  You order at the counter and wait for the food to be brought over.  They're understaffed, I even over heard them say so, so expect to wait to put your order in and wait some more for the overpriced food.  Oh yea, we ordered 2 breakfast sandwitches and 2 coffees for $40.

The portion is tiny, don't expect to get full but you can expect the feeling of being ripped off, bigtime...  We saw 3 ppl sit down and walked right out.  We should have followed.

I would recommend this place only for those staying in the hotel, want something extra light and don't mind spending alot of money.UPDATE:  They no longer have sweet potato waffles or free coffee refills.  After reading reviews and advice on how to find this place, we did find it but it was a real let down.  It is a small area between the halls of Venetian the hotel room and the spa.  Reminds me more of something you'd find in an airport than a Vegas spa.  The food was fine, but not worth the effort.We  visited the Great Dane on a Sunday approximately at 1 PM.  We were greeted by a hostess who told us that we were not allowed to order off of the main menu, and that we could only order off of the late night menu on account of the fact that they have a Sunday Buffet (she didn't bother to try to sell the buffet).  The place looks great and the Great Dane seems to have some cachet in the greater Madison area.  We were seated and promptly served by a capable waitress, Michelle.  She took my beer order, and promptly returned with the beer in a dirty glass.  She was cheerful about replacing it.  She then took our order, which consisted mostly of pub burgers and deep fried cheese.  The fried cheese was fairly obviously some frozen product, and was mediocre at best for about 8 DOLLARS!  The pub burgers came shortly thereafter.  It was pointless of Michelle to ask how we wanted our burgers, because they all arrived well done (I wanted mine medium rare).  The fries were good, but not great.  The beer (German Pils), although made on site, was stale and flat.  

The place is nice, clean, and the waitress was good.  Unfortunately for the waitress, she was the only server in the entire section and was quite frazzled.

Further, we had to climb a huge flight of stairs to get to the door - which wouldn't be bad in the summer, but the stairs were not shoveled and VERY dangerous.  DON"T TAKE ELDERLY PEOPLE ON THESE STAIRS!

The food seemed to be right out of the Sysco food service catalog, the management was obviously poor, and the beer wasn't good enough to make the trip another time.

Don't bother.  Go somewhere else.  Food was very pricey for what you get.The line is really long and those little vip passes are a joke. So if your a couple, mixed group, or a non barbie looking group of females expect to wait a while. Inside It was really crowded and there was more 30+ aged men than I thought there would be especially in the pussycat doll lounge. This place looks really nice the layout is great, just don't try to sit anywhere, even to fix the strap on your shoes, unless you have a table! Overall I did not have a good time because the line wait, the crowds, there was hardly anywhere to dance and thats why I go to clubs its to boogie. Also the night I went, Friday, it really seem like a Britney crowd, take it for what its worth.Pure is a nice looking place that provided a mediocre experience.  I know that exclusivity is something that is important for night clubs in Las Vegas to have, but an upscale image becomes meaningless when you make your customers feel unwelcomed and uncomfortable.

This past Sunday was my first visit to Pure. From the time we arrived, I felt like they could care less about our enjoyment.  It was as if they were doing us a favor by even letting us in.  Our names were on a VIP list through a Las Vegas promoter that I have had great experiences using before, and they still gave us a hard time getting in.  They pushed bottle service, sent us to the wrong line, and then told me that I was lucky to get in since I was wearing sneakers as I was walking in.  I can understand that they would like for people not to wear sneakers, but they should keep the comments to themselves since we were already headed in.  There was no one else there on a Sunday night...of course they were going to let us in!  They just didn't need to make it like we were entering a maximum security military base.

Once inside, we saw that the whole lower level was closed.  The upstairs balcony was the only area open, and it was tight (as in no room!).  Half of it was roped off for bottle service, and there was only a few people who actually bought it.  It was a huge waste of space, and everyone else ended up getting funneled into the middle of the balcony.  It caused a ridiculous bottleneck to get drinks, with the narrowest part being right in the middle of the dance floor.  Navigating around Pure was such a pain! Having to walk through the crowded dance floor every time I wanted to get a drink made it not worth the trouble.  They could easily solve the problem by having another bar on the opposite side as well.

The music at Pure was okay.  It was pretty good to begin with, but inexplicably got slower as the night went on.  It was more up tempo when we got there, and by the time we left it was just depressing.  The DJ was also not the greatest at mixing the music, so it was kind of a buzz kill.  

Pure is a nice looking place, but was not as fun as it should have been.  With a few minor adjustments, Pure could offer a really great experience.  It is just not a customer friendly place, and was uncomfortable to be at from the start.  There are lot of other night clubs in Las Vegas that do a better job about making the experience fun, and I will stick with those places until Pure adjusts its environment.Just not my cup of tea. Food wasn't very good either and was pretty expensive.  Communal dining isn't for memmmm, what ever happened to the Bellagio Buffet dinner? It definitely has gone downhill. Not only was the food just mediocre, the decor was gloomy as well. I've been to the Wynn Buffet before and it not only had great food, the atmosphere was bright and welcoming as well.  The only good thing about Bellagio's buffet was the desserts: cream puffs, creme brulee, strawberry tart...all very yummy.  I don't eat meat, so I can't speak for most of the main dishes, but the sushi was bland and most dishes were unmemorable. I did enjoy the seaweed salad, but I think that's store bought.

Next time I'll be heading to the Wynn buffet for sure, even if it's pricier.I have eaten here twice. The first time was because my family wanted to eat here and I was too drunk to walk anywhere else (we were staying at the Planet Hollywood). The second time is because we want to eat crab legs and this place offer crab leg at the best deal we found (Groupon).

All I went for was the crab leg and dessert, oh, and the unlimited mimosa (include in the Groupon deal). 

Everything was meh.....Except for the service. The services was....horrible. Everyone was tired and rude (and it was only 6:30PM when I ate there) from cashiers, to host, to waiters.

They sat us own without silverware. Even though that did not stop us from eatting crab legs with our hand, I still pissed. I am a lady and would like to use my utensil in public.

There was a group of 8 people in front of us in line. So apparently, they will ask for  additional $20 to sit a party of 6 (either 6 or 8) or more together, please beware of this silly policy.

The food was basic Vegas: steak, salad, crab legs, cupcakes for dessert, etc. Everything was doable. Just the service drops it down to the below average.I really want to like this place better. By the looks of the photos on here I think I just had a below average experience. 

We went this July - knew it would be crowded and it was. No biggie, we were prepared to have a drink while we waited anyways and found two barstools open at the bar! I ordered the Brandy Slush - a past favorite of my wives. It wasn't mixed right - was way too sweet and didn't have the right mix - and the bartender was a bit of a jerk. No big deal, but probably won't get that again. 

Saw a co-worker at the bar who told us they love love love the Cheese Curds here. My first mistake was not ordering any. I guess I wasn't in a fried cheese curd mood - plus I ended up ordering the Mac and Cheese with Ring Bologna and figured that would be enough cheese. Maybe it had to do with the fact that it was Summer and hot - but I did not enjoy the Mac and Cheese and Ring Bologna. The cheese sauce was not yummy or impressive and although the Ring Bologna may have been of good quality - it wasn't what I expected. Might have been better on a super cold wintery night. My wife got a sandwich and that looked much better.

Service was OK considering they were packed full and had a good waiting list. From the photos online and other dishes I saw around me, I think I'll give this place another try - but from this first visit I wasn't impressed.The Hotel as Mandalay Bay was just okay compared with other hotels we've stayed at in Las Vegas.  "The" Hotel....emphasis on the "The" is the way you are supposed to pronounce it.  The room was the nicest part about "The" Hotel.  It was spacious and tastefully decorated.  The bathroom was large and beautiful as well.  They do not provide a built in closet to hang your items.  They brought in a small piece of furniture that you can hang some items in, but it is only for one person....you cannot hang clothing for 2 people or more....it just won't fit....we tried. The Spa was closed while we were there and because we like to use the Spa, we were not happy about this.  The long long walk to the pool (bad signage along the way) was packed.  No problem, but just try and get a chair! You better get there are 9:00 a.m. if you want one.  So, we had to go to the South Lagoon pool.  We did get a chair but it was dirty, old and uncomfortable.  It was noisy as well with helicopters and planes constantly above us.  For all that I had heard about this hotel pool, I was disappointed with how crowded it was.  I also thought that the pool complex would have been much larger.  The $12.00 Mohito was not so great and took a half hour for the waitress to bring.  The Fleur De Lys restaurant that advertised happy hour within the Mandalay Bay complex was falsely advertised.  They advertised complimentary appetizers....didn't put them out until the end of the happy hour and it was only....get this....POPCORN!  Two for one drinks...only a list of about 6 to choose from.....so instead of paying $15.00 you pay $7.50, but they weren't the drinks we wanted.  Have you ever heard of two for one wine for happy hour???? My $16.00 glass of wine didn't even taste good, so they had no chance of us staying on for dinner.  There is too much competition in Las Vegas to try and pull something like this...so to falsely advertise is foolish!  We like the Encore much better and even got a better room rate there.geeze, what is that STANK!!!?

Though the rooms were decent for living quarters there is this amazing foul smell on the floor every single time we walk into our hotel and into our rooms! 

for $500 for the weekend, i shouldn't be getting stinky rooms?!! regardless, I thought The Hotel was suppose to be nicer because each suite has a living room and restroom and than a door that opens up to the bedroom with a double bed, restroom comes with a bath and a shower . 

our room was right on next to the night club, so around 6pm the music was already going crazy! It leaves people like my friends that party all night and then party all morning from day clubbing with little to no rest! I really wished they mentioned that it may be nosy so please excuse that. Of course, no warnings! 

Terrible!Not the best steakhouse that I have been to...  I was very surprised by this as I have heard great things about this place.  The biggest objection that I had in addition to the food was the pricing on their wine.  The standard that you see is a 2x mark up this is why I was very surprised that it was 5x.  (example Joesph Phelps Cab $25 dollars retail and it was $140 on the wine list!)  I recommend if you come here to bring your own wine and pay the corkage of $35 per bottle.I was very highly recommended to see this show by many people.  While in Vegas I saw KA and O.  I really loved Ka, but I have to say I was very disappointed by O.  The diving and choreography were awesome and beautiful, but as a show, I found it to be confusing, disjointed, strange, and kind of... underwhelming.  For the money I was severely disappointed.  I will have to see other shows to see what else is out there, but I definitely prefered Ka to O.I don't see how this place is only $$$ with $88 entrees on the menu, but then I don't think the $$$ range should be $30-60.  Considering that side dishes are extra, unless you are very careful it is going to be easy to blow through the ceiling of $60/person.
  
It is a decent atmosphere, the waiter was good if not a little arrogant, but overall did a decent job.

Although they don't show it on the menu link in Yelp, they had sushi the night we were there.  I had a sushi roll with crab, lobster and jalapeno and it was good.  However, I think $25 for a sushi roll is a bit over the top.  

I do give high marks for the Miso soup. It was probably the best I have had.

One of my dining partners reported that the lobster in their dish was pretty chewy.

The food quality is good, but not blow me away, so I feel value-wise this is a 2 star.This club sucks. The club is cramped. There is no room for dancing, sitting, resting. There is an outside patio/deck, but that's the only thing. The music is played through a computer and they do not finish all the songs. The kind of play them as if you were using that Winamp extension where you fade in and out of songs. Crappy.I have to admit, I was pretty disappointed.  Yes, when I walked in, I was blown away by the waterfall and the decor. 

But this place was tiny! And the drinks sucked.  Not only did it cost twice as much, but they were half as weak. I down 2 drinks (a Grateful Dead which is basically a purple AMF) and NOTHING.  How do you get an AMF and NOT get f'ed up?! or at least a good buzz?

Oh and for a saturday night, 2 DJs couldn't get a groove on if their lives depended on it. I swear every other song they played was a stall. I mean when EVERYONE on the dance floor stops moving except for the drunks who can't stay still for 2 seconds, yeah... we have a problem. 

Oh and forget about having a place to sit unless you have table service (which is expected... I ain't that lame).  

I'm thinking twice about giving this even 2 stars... oh yeah, cuz the waterfall was pretty awesome.As good as the food and atmosphere are...the service is equally bad. The place is small and somewhat pricey although not terribly. We have been several times and have a decent meal. Nothing great. Servers with some care and hustle would make this place stand out. Sadly it falls very short of the potential.Beautiful property but last time we stayed there they were oversold. We arrived @10pm to find out that the word "reservation" did not mean they had a room for us.
They said they had overcommitted & we had to drive 20 mins & check into another hotel - our room would be available the next day. 
What a pain! My husband was there got a meeting being held @ the JW, so he had to get up extra early the next am to account for travel time back to the JW & I had to move our stuff back.We went here after reading many stellar reviews and hearing from friends that it was the best food in town.  First things, first the waitresses and hostesses were not very pleasant.  They hardly welcomed us in at 6:30 on a Sunday.  It was about 85 degrees out and the building doesn't appear to have AC which was clearly ticking them off, but as people who are trying to help them make money for the evening I was put out by their attitudes.  We decided to dine outside where our smile-less waitress continued to bus the table next to us.  Rather than taking the previous diners full glasses of water back to the kitchen she chose to hurl the water into the street while we were eating.  Now I know this isn't a fancy restaurant but along with the sour puss she wore the whole time we were there I found this to be rude.  The food was decent, but one of the entrees was over cooked.  When we didn't ask to box it she asked if there was something wrong and I told her the beef was really really tough.  She said she would take it off the bill and did, thankfully.  When I went in later to drop off the check she did finally come out with a little personality and say that she tried our dish and it was awful and that she was sorry.  All in all there wasn't anything that would encourage me to come back.HAUNTED!! (tm Kristina R)

.... Not.

My husband and I, along with a couple that we're friends with, stayed at this old Las Vegas hotel for three days. We had seen on TV that supposedly Houdini's ghost haunts this place. The only haunting that I experienced is the "ghost of cigarettes past". Ugh. Our room (which was 'nonsmoking') smelled like we were actually sleeping inside an ashtray. I think I might've gotten a nicotine addiction just from hanging out in our hotel room!

The place is run down, the guests here all are at the lower end of the economic scale, and about 20 years older than us on average, but you know what? We still had fun! I played my favorite slot machine: WHEEL! OF! FORTUUUUUNE!!! Yeah, baby, I made bank, too! I must've won at least $200 in quarters, and only put in about $40 of my own money to start... after that I played off my winnings. I came home with $180, which to me, is fantabuloso! 

I also played some roulette, and stayed at the table for quite some time (a couple hours) before I skedaddled with my winnings... a whopping $80. Hey, I doubled my money... how many of you can say THAT? (I always bring only $40 to a table. Never more. It's a hard and fast rule of mine.)

The diner inside the hotel was... well, a diner. It had diner type fare. Not bad. Not great, either, but satisfying.

The Plaza is right at the end of Fremont Street, though, which is a fun place to walk around at night, when it's all lit up and they have music going. There are lots of old casinos here that are probably haunted, too, from the looks of them. Old. Decrepit. Stinky. Yeah, they MUST be haunted! We didn't see any ghosts.... or DID we??

But we won't be staying here again.... it's too far from the strip, and it was kind of a bummer to have to walk to the bus stop, ride the hot bus for 20 minutes, and then peel yourself off the seats when you reach the Strip. Not too glamourous. 

If you're into "old school Vegas", where you might run into the ghost of Dean Martin, or Old Blue Eyes, then by all means, stay at The Plaza. If you want to be close to the shows, fountains, and general youthful glitter of Vegas, though, best to stay somewhere on The Strip.Eh I wasn't impressed. I enjoy the atmosphere in Orlando better. We sat in the bar and the server seemed disinterested in serving us. We arrived an hour before they closed which was really early for Vegas and he told us three times within the hour that they closed soon. It was like Dude we get the message we will leave your table in time for you to go home. The drinks we got were great but not proportioned to the price.People rave about this place but I don't get it.  It is an average buffet.  Quantity is there but I expected better quality.  Things may look nice but tastes is not so special.I came here super excited since the Wynn has such a highly raved buffet of Vegas and from many satisfied friends. Though there was not a line when my boyfriend and I arrived, and plenty of tables all around, it took a good 30 minutes before we got seated. Alright, I'll let it slide this time. So got seated and ordered a pink lemonade mixed with Sprite because I was so thirsty from the desert heat. when I gulped up my first glass,m I headed towards the food. 

The way I usually eat at buffets is I'll walk around the whole area, see what they got, then mentally divide and pair up which foods I'll get together in each trip. Started off with some pasta. I love me some pasta. I got the tortellini and noticed they had a made-to-order pasta station. Oooooooh! There was a line so I decided to come back. Let's just say that tortellini and the cocktail shrimps were the best of the entire buffet. The ravioli I got at the pasta station after tasted like shit. They only had 2 soup choices where other buffets have at least 4. The corn on the cob was so soggy and greasy. The selection at the Wynn buffet is so minimal. There wasn't much to eat. 

Not to mention that the plates weren't all fully cleaned. I came across two plates my entire meal that had specks of sauce on it still. I left still hungry. I should have went to Bellagio.Crappy sushi, and our server was overwhelmed and took way too long to get our drinks, miso soup, and edamame.  (10 minutes for the drinks, then another 10 for the soup, then another 5 minutes for the edamame).
Plus, the ambiance inside was awful-  the red lights are retarded, seriously, get some new lighting.  The loud club music was pretty annoying as well.
If you have any taste for sushi, you're not going to find it for a good price in Vegas.  Either don't go out, or go to a $$$$.  This place is for middle-American tourists and high school kids.
-Oh, the worst hot sake I've ever ingested.We stayed here because the convention in town (ICSC) that I was attending caused everything else to be booked - even the crummy regular Hilton next to the convention center.  This propoerty was built around 2004 and is still in fairly good condition.  It's really a timeshare property that they operate as a hotel for the unsold units.  Frankly, if my room was representative of the whole property, or similar timeshares elsewhere, I can't imagine who would buy a unit...but I digress.

If you're staying here strictly as a one-time hotel guest here are the problems:

1) No onsite casino / restaurant / shows / shopping / etc.  If you're in Vegas, you probably want to do at least one of these things, none of which is on-site or even next door.  So you have to get in a cab, which brings me to my next point...

2) No cab line.  Since this isn't a major resort, there are no cabs lined up to take people where they need to go.  And, when there are people lined up waiting, and a cab trickles in every 5-10 minutes or so, it can get pretty frustrating.

3)  Rooms were nice, but basic.  A little kitchenette with a fridge and microwave were in mine, but no desk to set up a lap top.

One positiive thing: it was fairly inexpensive - $149/night.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend since it doesn't offer any of what people go to Vegas for.  And, it's not even easy to catch a cab from here to get to the places you do want to go.I was a bit leery to try a buffet...they are not typically my favorite places to eat - but what the heck the reviews sounded pretty good.  When we arrived I did have a bit of sticker shock with the prices.  It has been a long time since we were in Vegas so the price per head has definitely increased.  Luckily we were with some locals so we ended up getting a rather large discount...that was the good part of the evening.

At first the waiter was pretty attentive, but after getting our first round of drinks and clearing a couple of plates he disappeared.  He was gone so long that we filled the adjacent table and the top of the pony wall with plates.  It wasn't that we were piggish, there were 9 of us.  When he came back his attitude was a little nasty and he ended up spilling the remaining contents of a plate on the seat where my nieces husband had been sitting.
Now let's talk about the food...while it wasn't horrible it certainly was not great.  It did not live up to the reviews in the least.  In comparison the buffet on Carnival Cruise Lines would be 5 star...don't waste your money.A very ho-hum show.  The theater was absolutely gorgeous...not a bad seat in the house.  The show, however, leaves one to wonder how the creative genius behind Cirque du Soleil could've created such a boring show.  Let me emphasize, this is not a Cirque show.  Le Reve was created by the same artistic director who created the fantastic Cirque shows in Vegas.  My suggestion is to save your money, bypass this show, and instead watch one of the other Cirque shows in town (Mystere is by far my favorite).If you are in Vegas and you want the whole buffet experience... this is NOT the place to go! It has decent food.. decent desserts.. what really caught my eye was the service. They are fast, amazing and super friendly! I had the pleasure of having Rudy as my server. He was so funny and gave me really good advice in life! LOL.. how does that happen?! Obviously, amazing customer service who actually wants to talk to you and get to know you!

Overall, i wouldn't recommend this buffet... but if you are doing the whole 7 buffets day thing... I would go here :)we have been here a few times when we we go to vegas and its usually good...

It was mediocre at best this time and our server had no personality at all.

They wanted $27.99 for a 6 piece shrimp dinner!! Um, no... 

Our food was so so. Husband got the pork tenderloins and they were over cooked and his potatoes tasted like they were out of the box instant ones...

Our kids got chicken fingers that were standard.

Go there for drinks again maybe, but the food has gone downhill.This place looks really old and run down and when you get inside you feel the same. theres tons of brands and most of which have great sales going on. 

be weary of the kiosks. those guys are salesmen to the umpteenth power. 

theres food shops here and there but the 3 times ive visited the mall ive only went for the shopping and im outty.. no need to overstay such an unwelcoming experience.The victim here is the culinary staff. Party of 3 and we ordered the penne pasta, the filet, and the tomahawk steak for entrees. Tater tots, gratin potatoes, and asparagus as sides. Jelly donuts for dessert. Everything was excellent. I mean delicious! Wish I could say the same for the front of the house. Checked in for an 8pm reservation and did not get seated until 8.15pm. I feel the reservation didn't do anything. When I made the reservation, I noted we were celebrating a birthday. Now I don't expect a free sundae like it's an Applebees or anything, but not a single person acknowledged the birthday.  We were sent to the bar after not getting seated for our 8pm reservation. It took them 15 minutes (up until the time we were seated) to get drinks. Then, there was a confusing 5 min conversation about transferring the charges to our table. My guess is they found 4 of the most attractive women they could find that never worked a day in food service, and hired 2 as hostesses and the other 2 as bartenders.  The service staff at the table was ok, but when the bill is $300 for 3 people, I expected more. All in all, 5 stars for food, minus 1 for price-to-quality ratio, minus 1 for blowing the reservation, minus 1 for not acknowledging the birthday.  Would not go back.This restaurant used to be good.  Host station with to much attitude.  Ordered surf and turf steak good but the two pound main lobster came out a one pounder with parts missing. Cmon guys at least give customer what they paid for.  I have 20 years in the business so my advice to management is look at customer service very carefully and be consistent with the food you offer.   Presentation and quality is key.  Will be frequenting the steak house at circus circus for a while. They got it together.What a letdown of an experience from the "city that never sleeps". 

Empty main bar, after a while we were herded into a smaller room so it gave the appearance of it being packed, but then people just got bored and left. 

I know there's not reallllllllly a gay nucleus in LV, but you're better off going to some of the other clusters of bars SE side from the strip.So I lived in Brazil for a couple years, and up until coming here, had never been to a sub-par Brazilian restaurant.  The only other place I had been in this area was Fogo de Chao - which was pricey, but incredible.  

I imagine going to this place for lunch, would be okay.  It looked like you could get out of there for around $15 for lunch.  But for two dinners, two cans of guarana (Brazilian soda) and tip, it was well over $100.  Let me say that the quality of food & service would have been more reasonable in the $40 range.

The cheese bread (pao de quejo) was amazing - but it's impossible to screw that up.  The salad bar was worse than Sizzler.  I couldn't believe that rice & beans weren't available in the salad bar area, and all of the "prepared" salads looked like they were scooped out of a pre-packaged bin.

The grilled pineapple was good, and the picanha (sirloin) was decent - but overall the meat selection was poor, and many of the pieces were dry and overcooked.  I guess when you spend $100 for a night out with the wife, you expect great service & to leave satisfied.  It just didn't happen here.My last memories of the MGM Buffet was maybe 2 or 3 years ago before they started doing this "all-day buffet" thing. I love the concept of paying a flat rate of $33.60 (more on the weekends) and getting 3 turns at the buffet from Breakfast, Lunch to Dinner. They hand you this card where they will punch a hole in everytime you eat. Kind of like your high school lunch card. 

I came here for breakfast, and there was nothing breakfast wise that really impressed me. I would say the best item during breakfast was having roast beef with au jus which is really a lunch or dinner item. 

Lunch time, they expanded the trays a bit. I remember them used to have some type of fish or salmon.  They had shrimp in the open bar, but nothing spectacular. The high light item was the desert plate of tiramasu. Still this is not as good as the buffet at the Paris. 

Lastly at dinner, the gf found the california rolls to be a high light and I m not much of a sushi fan. So I got stuck with roast beef au jux again for dinner. 

Overall I wasn't impressed and I notice that the quality has degraded since the old days of MGM. If you want great buffet food go elsewhere. If you want a good bang for your buck, then come here. If you are getting a special with MGM where you get 2 for 1 buffet, then definitely take advantage of it. Otherwise, there are plenty of better buffet options out there.That photo is so misleading. Came here for lunch (with a voucher from our hotel) and because it was brunch hours, prices were $30 per person. There weren't any seafood, 1 meat station, and mostly cheap breakfast items...definitely not a good place for lunch. Stayed around to gamble, dinner looked good with some crab legs, lamb, and other foods.

Dessert place is also small...at this price level, definitely go to Wicked Spoon over MGM Grand.Tonight my family and I dined at the MGM Grand Buffet, complimentary buffet thanks to New York New York. I must say this buffet was far from Grand ... It wasn't that great at all. I am glad i didn't spend $86 of my own money. This buffet needs more kid friendly food. My daughter had fried chicken, slice of pizza, vegetables, salad. 

As I walked around the buffet, I noticed they had minimal selections of food. The woman working the carving station in charge of the prime beef, turkey, and sausage seemed brand new! I watched her cut slices of prime rib, they would splash onto the cutting board & the juice from the meat splattered over 2 customers onto their clothes. The prime rib was under cooked, the turkey slices were cut too thick, & were dry. 

I ventured over to where the crab legs & shrimp were located. The crab legs looked decent, but I didn't have any. The shrimp .... Oh my goodness ... I can't believe this hotel served this fishy, smelly, old shrimp to their patrons. The shrimp was brown, smelled really horrible, & had white dots on it ... (Please see the picture of the old shrimp I uploaded) ! I know what OLD shrimp looks like & they had a whole big tray full of it ... People were grabbing them by the spoonfuls ... Ick I was getting ill ! 

The desserts were decent. They have a delicious Oreo cheesecake, chocolate cupcake, and carrot cake. The servers wait staff was pleasant, but didn't attend to us very much. 

Would we come back here for bland food & old shrimp ..... NO thank you.Eh bruddah, da kine of sushi you served me sucked. It wasn't fresh. This is probably the first time I've complained about "freshness" from a sushi restaurant because the places I go to, the Japanese sushi chef would never serve anything not fresh (well, not raw... cooked up, it becomes an employee meal)!, but da nihonjin Hawaiian sushi chef that we sat in front of just let that slide. This is probably one of the worst places I've been to.

Also don't expect any chef specials because of the clientele of the patrons who frequent this place (haole's, first timers, "rolls/california roll" type of diners), they don't have anything out of the ordinary or even typical items of a real Japanese restaurant. Instead its the bare basics.

The interior was really nice, but it's probably the only thing it has going for itself because the service sucked too. We went the week after Halloween so the place was bascially empty, yet they couldn't even mange three people for the sushi bar..... luckily the bartender took charge and made sure we were seated.We really like going to Famous Daves for the reasonable priced menu and the delicious BBQ! But first impressions from any waitstaff is cruicial for my dining experience. 
   This time the food was still great but the corn bread muffins were hard but again, non, the less the food was great. However, this response to my experience is all about service! I cannot stand waiting more than 5 minutes to be greeted! I understand that a server could be busy and have quite aways to walk from one end of the restaurant to the other...I get it...however a bartender? This bartender didn't even acknowledge or outwardly say, "Hello there, I'll be right over". NOTHING. 7 minutes before a greet could seem like 30 minutes to someone who's stomach is eating their backbone. 

   We all know that a bad start could ruin a whole dining experience. Live and learn--but next time I will request to sit NOT in the bar area. I repeat to all, this rating is all about service and has nothing to do with the delicious BBQ! Keep on BBQin Dave!Food was marginal for the price. The service was terrible. It took forever to be served, and get the check. When I gave the server my card, he said it was declined even though I knew there was money on it. He also made another server come and tell me the card was declined, and take another form of payment. The server was rude, and took his time waiting on us, even though there were only a few other tables occupied. 

On a more positive note, the view is terrific! I would recommend going to the lounge or the observation deck rather than paying for dinner.This place is alright, there's just way too many bastard kids running around.  The only good thing about this mall opening is that it makes seeing a weekend night movie at the Esplanade a bit more pleasant, clearly this is the happening place to be for yuppie spawn and I couldn't be happier.I have given this place chance by chance and I just can't like this place anymore.  Happy Hour is decent and the house beers are good.  What kills it for me is the Rib Eye steak.  Everytime I order it its either under or over cooked to my liking.  Doesn't taste that good.  I come here for the Steak and nothing else.  I don't think I will try this place to eat the steak again.My husband and I have been here many times before and always had a good experience. This time, we went in around 4pm to get a bite to eat. Sat at the bar, took 25 minutes before anyone offered us a menu- even though they were all looking at us but kept horsing around & talking with other patrons who were obviously dressed to get a free drink. Once we got a menu (with not being asked what we would like to drink- hello? we are sitting at a BAR..) the bartender came back 15 minutes later to wash a glass and I had to let him know we were ready to order. He asked "what do you want?". It then took 20 minutes to get one order of appetizer chicken strips. The man who brought it out to us was very nice and polite and was the one to finally ask if we wanted something to drink. It of course took another 20 minutes after being done eating to get the idiot bartenders attention to ask for our bill. Needless to say- we did not tip. I am a big believer in cutting slack because servers/bartenders etc get busy- but really? 4pm on a Tuesday with 8 people at the bar, 5 of them flirting to get on the bartenders good side? I'll waste my time at Denny's down the road.

Toby- I love you but get some new staff.WOW vegas....lets amp up the prices by like 50%! SOoooo expensive here. I got one drink and a pastry and it was pretty much $10. 

Usually like this place, regardless of their super sweeeet drinks. lolExtremely dark inside. (needed flashlights to read menus).  Rushed service and food was just average.  I'll stick with il Mulino for their mind blowing service and food.What a disappointment. 

First off, lights would be nice. I seldom complain about the amount of lighting, but it was bloody dark in there. 

Petty complaint aside, the food was really uninteresting. The sonoran chicken was red, but had no flavor. The refried beans? Dry as a bone. On my wife's plate, they clearly had been sitting under a heat lamp for too long because they were cracked along the surface and very obviously dried out. Seriously? I'd say the service was fine, but the waiter let it come out looking like that, so points off for not bothering to notice. 

Second start is only because of the cheese crisp, which was tasty.After walking thru the miracle mile shopping center in Planet Hollywood I was starving. Mexican food sounded good so I shared steak and chicken fajitas with my boyfriend. 

The food was actually pretty decent but getting the food took forever! We waited for forever just to get our drinks and pretty much had to hunt someone down to order our food. Even after getting our food the waiter forgot about us, so then I had to hunt him down again to get more drinks. The service was horrible! Every person from the lady seating us to our waiter must have been having a horrible day because they were anything but friendly!

They had a photographer walking around who would take pictures of each table and give you a post card of the picture for free. She would then offer other pictures that of course cost money and boy oh boy! Beware, if you don't want these photos she gets upset! It's hard to have a nice lunch with such negative people surrounding you!

On the plus side, we sat outside which was great for people watching! Overall I would probably pass on eating at this place again. There are so many other restaurants in Vegas that have better service and even tastier food.If you are a simpleton and like basic foods, this is the place for you.  I normally like to explore foods of a higher culinary expertise, though I do still appreciate the basics.  If you fit this category, read on..

I was visiting Las Vegas with my parents and trying to show them why the buffets here are impressive, and after searching Yelp for the right one, I chose Cravings.  We were there at about 8pm on a Saturday night.  There was no line, which probably should have been an indication that it wasn't great, but at that point we had been looking for the "perfect" buffet and were just tired of searching.

They had a wide variety of categories to choose from: Italian, carved meat, Latin, Mediterranean, Seafood, Sushi, Chinese and Salad.  However, within each category was the most basic of each food.  

Italian: Pizza, pastas with either marinara or alfredo sauces. (I was hoping for fire baked crust and made-to-order pizzas, rather than old, hard cheese and meat)
Carved meat: Prime rib or Turkey (where was the sirloin steak and 
Latin: Texas chili (not Latin!), tamales, and enchiladas
Mediterranean: pita bread, babaganoush, hummous.  (that's it??)
Seafood: chilled cocktail shrimp and crab legs (they were too salty) and baked tilapia and salmon (typical)
Chinese: stir friend veggies, beef chow mein, fried rice, orange chicken (comparable to Panda Express)
Salad: romaine lettuce with your choice of dressing, and vegetable toppings (I was hoping for fruit toppings and candied nuts)

And for dessert:  only a couple of selections of pie: dutch apple, raspberry chocolate silk, lemon merengue, and sugar free cheesecakes.  Throw in a few choices of rock-hard cookies and fresh fruit.

I was expecting much more, to say the least.  I probably won't be coming back again, with or without my parents.  They weren't really impressed and we all felt that money spent on food did not match the quality.

This being said, I have been to the buffet at Aria, and was much more impressed... See Aria for further review.The Bay Area has everything a food lover could want, except for high quality buffets. That's why I always go to the buffets when I'm in Vegas. I'd been to Mandalay's buffet a number of years ago and rated it nearly as good as the Bellagio for quality and variety. Sad to say, the Mandalay Bay buffet was a huge disappointment this week. Black fungus on the stone crab claws, frozen, overcooked to mush vegetables, glutenous fried rice in the Chinese food section, roast chicken quarters that looked dry, the same sparse pieces baking away all night under the heat lamp, butterflied, deep fried prawns with mushy interior, cantaloupe and watermelon on the verge of crossing over to the bad side, chicken cordon bleu that was less flavorful than I can imagine coming from any brand in the Safeway frozen food aisle. Seems like the Mandalay Bay resort has given up on this restaurant. I will not go back.Good atmosphere. But the food was nothing special, especially considering the price.We made a reservation for 8:30pm on April 12th.  I figured it was good timing prior to our Jay Leno show at 10pm.  We were seated as we arrived.  The hostess wished us happy anniversary, which was nice of her.  Apparently it showed on their system when my husband made the reservation.

We had a nice table and our waiter seemed nice.  We were surprised that an Asian/Japanese fusion restaurant didn't have Plum Wine.  That's the most unusual thing I've ever heard of.

We ordered several small plates.  Grilled Asparagus, Chilean Sea Bass, Salad, Carpaccio, Salmon Sashimi and couple of rolls.  I made it clear that the rice portion of our meal will be from the sushi.  Everything came slowly and after waiting an hour for the sushi rolls, our waiter tells us it will be another 45 minutes.  REALLY!?  Are you kidding me?  I canceled the sushi order and left still hungry.  All the small meals that my husband and I shared were too small for any satisfaction to happen.

To think that it cost an arm and a leg to leave hungry...pretty ridiculous!

BTW-the 2 stars are for the Asparagus and Sea Bass.  Everything else is worth NOTHING!

Have not been this disappointed in a restaurant in a very long time.

Will not be returning!Went there for lunch today and here's my take - Great Service, but the food is best eaten when drunk because it's meh, and still at Scottsdale downtown prices.

All in all, for food I'd rather go to Chuy's at 32nd St &Thomas Rd seven days a week instead.

However...it did look like a fun place to hang out on a Friday night so I might be back for  a beer in the future!While visiting Vegas my local friend took me to Piranha to experience Vegas nightlife. I was unprepared for the $20 cover but later learned that this was a standard cover for non-locals.

I was unimpressed with the crowd, the ambiance and the size of the club/bar. We stayed for about 25 minutes and I will not go back. This place just isn't my scene.

Cons
The go go dancers are allegedly straight and didn't dance, they just ran in place.
The crowd was tired, unattractive locals
The dance floor is itty bitty and no one even danced they just stood around looking at each other.

Pros
You can smoke inside, but that is available everywhere in Vegas.
There are no slot machines.This is strictly for how they operate their "Call Ahead" seating. Their food is usually impeccable. I will never understand their stupid call ahead, maintain two list, absurd process. I called ahead at 6:50 pm. Was told the wait was 40 min. Great as I would be there in 40 min so I had my name placed on the list. Got there at 7:30 and they couldn't find my name. So they put my name on the "call ahead" list and told about 30 min wait while they were on a 1 hour wait at this point (exactly why I called ahead).

Talked to the "manager" (really just the key server) and she said they did have my name on the "call ahead" list and my wait would be about 30 min. That the "call ahead" list just shortens your wait to about half the current wait. Really? And just how do they go about calculating this? My wife has worked for Outback for over 6 years and says that system is still as screwed up as when they first introduced it.

Here's a novel idea, when someone calls, just put their name on the list! If they're not there when called, skip them, just as if they showed up in person. Really not that hard and you don't have to maintain two separate lists forever trying to explain your logic in doing so to customers.

The truth is, Outback really doesn't care about this system. They're always on a wait so no big deal if customers don't like it and go home. It just reduces the wait time. So we left and went across the street to Gordon Biersch. That's another review.It's close to 3am and you just got in from a night of excess Vegas style. You're hungry and all the neon lights are killing your eyes. All you want is a slice of pizza and the comfort of your bed....

I wouldn't say Sirrico's to the rescue but it will do as the scene above plays out on your Saturday night in Sin City.

Talking to the others in line and watching the passer-bys is better than their pie but what are ya gonna do?!?!?!I love the food but this time the service was crap. We eat here every month or so and have noticed the service degrading. Ordered drinks and waitress left before we could order appetizers. Popped up again after we waited a good 15 minutes and let us order appetizers then she vanished before we could place our dinner order... Appetizers sat at the sushi bar until we pointed them out to another server. That server brought them to us but was only able to find one of the things we ordered. Ahi wonton crisps are my favorite which is why there are 2 stars up rather than one. We should have abandoned ship at that point I think. We were drinking and having a good time so we weren't in any particular hurry to eat but this was pushing it to the point that we and others in our party started to get annoyed. Sushi order was screwed up from the get go. Our waitress offered a "sorry" and quickly walked away rather than fixing it. Had to get our own silverware and ask them for condiments. Was late Saturday night and while the bar was busy, the restaurant area was mostly empty. Some booths were taken but none of the tables, so not very busy... not busy enough to excuse the poor treatment. Whole night was a bit of a mess. Portions were much smaller than normal. Wondering if they have changed management or had to cut back on costs.
We had to get other servers and a bus boy at one point to get our food or order additional sushi. Star rating went down as the evening went on. Was excited to take our friends here but ended up embarrassed and disappointed all night. What happened to my favorite restaurant????? When we left, rather than being content the couples were complaining about having paid for an unsatisfactory meal. For the price we paid I can't justify ever going back. Too many great restaurants out there to bother with an average chain.Only good for happy hour. Eight dollars a glass of cheap wine is over priced.just to be fair, the pricing at this place is the best and is what drew me here in the first place: 

-- The Excalibur has a 2-for-1 buffet special every day between 2  - 6 pm for $17.99. (Special not valid with any other offer, Children's prices not included. Not available during holiday periods.)

-- PLUS -- $25 all day buffet pass... 

now for the review, 2 star is a bit harsh since I usually factor in the pricing for the value calculation. We were walking around the strip hungry and it's nearing 2pm, saw the ad above and decided it's actually cheaper than eating at the food court. 

however, if I have a choice for another buffet on the strip next time, I probably would not have bothered to come here, the food is below LV standards and I am glad that I only paid 1/2 price for it (2-for-1 deal)... 

overall, though, I still have to admit that it's cheaper to eat here than at the food court for fast food, though not sure about if the calorie count is worth it...Have you ever succumbed to peer pressure only to experience major waves of regret later?  Like that time you didn't want to wing-woman for your girlfriend because you had ill intuitions about the friend of the guy she likes.  This is Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill.  It bears a famous chef's name and lives inside a famous casino, yet is emptier in content than a stripper's conversation after the lap dance.

Our out-of-town friends wanted to visit Wolfgang Puck, I hadn't been there for more than a year and had no recollection of what I ate on my last visit, but out-of-town friends often get to make the decisions, so I suffered another forgettable experience at Wolfgang Puck.  We had the Pink Lady Apple & Pear Salad which was okay, if not a little drenched in dressing.  Then after our order of sea bass was rejected because the kitchen didn't get the fish that day, we got the organic chicken.  It was served on top of mashed potatoes, with roasted carrots.  Carrots were undercooked, potatoes and chicken were all right, nothing to make an impression.  

Fifty dollars for a meal I would pay around fifteen dollars...  The latter probably would have a more authentic atmosphere, not a generic view of MGM tourists.  This is what's wrong with Vegas, a fraudulent copy to overcompensate for soul-less commercialism.Save yourself from disappointment by walking in with low expectations. If you're after a celebrity chef restaurant here in Las Vegas, hit Mesa or Scarpetta instead.I love CVS but I hate this location because of the lurkers.  

The staff are always friendly and helpful. I've never had a problem finding what I needed.  I love the extra bucks program! And CVS carries Burt's Bees brand which I also love.  (And who doesn't love getting extra bucks on stuff they're going to buy anyway?)

But because of the lurkers I only shop here during daylight hours.I've been coming here since before the name change and have always liked the atmosphere, coffee, and staff but have stopped coming here frequently because they have taken away what makes all independent coffee shops great, free wifi. 

Wifi is made available only to paying customers (understandable), but on an incremental system. Spend $4-$7 and get 1 hour. 

Value has been shifted from the customer to the customer's wallet and has made madhouse more of a "get in and get out" coffee shop than a "come enjoy a drink and get some work done" shop.

Madhouse has lost much of its appeal and I have switched to nearby competitors, independent and corporate, who offer a relaxed atmosphere, fair coffee, and unlimited wifi.I was expecting this place to be amazing, but found myself disappointed. I did not mind the $50 cover charge (Sunday) but for that price I was expecting this place to be packed. Instead, I found myself in a pool surrounded by 70 guys and maybe 20 chicks. It was 2 pm and the pool was not even half full. I realized I was Gona have to get drunk fast and thank Jesus the bartenders knew how to make a strong drink. Drinks were actually pretty cheap compared to other pool parties.The food was decent - get the mesquite fries - the sweet potato ones are covered in sugar (not quite my idea of good sweet potato fries). the burger was alright. server wasn't too amazing (and it wasn't that busy when I was there, so they really had no excuse for bad service. prices were decent for Vegas. 

probably won't go back unless i have to.We had just about an hour to kill before a show, so we chose the bar at The Pub for a quick bite and drinks.

It was around 5:30PM on a Saturday when we arrived and although it was a busy weekend for Las Vegas (college basketball tournaments, St. Patrick's Day), they weren't busy and we were able to grab two seats at the bar right away.

The bartender was nice and relatively attentive (we didn't need much attention). We glanced at their food and beer menus and ordered within a few minutes. The draft prices were decent for the strip and we were pleased with our selections. 

I chose the Mayan Steak Salad ($15) to munch on something light. I ordered the steak medium rare and the salad came with baby spinach (not listed), red onion, jicama, cherry tomato, canned Mandarin orange (listed as just orange), roasted corn, avocado, and cumin vinaigrette. The steak was cooked appropriately, but lacked any kind of flavor. The salad was sad and not worth $15. They tried though and the description seemed promising. I'm sure they do "bar food" well (or at least I'd hope), but if you're going to sell a salad for $15, it better be good.

We visited The Pub when it first opened in Fall 2009 (after revamping itself from "Brewpub" with a seven-month hiatus) and both enjoyed our experience. However, we hadn't been back because we rarely find ourselves in Monte Carlo. I'm not sure if things have changed since then, but I didn't order anything fried and/or greasy this time to make a fair comparison. Either way, the prices are steep and based on my salad experience, the preparation and ingredients are not worth the cost.Food was fair. We have been to the other Roys at JW much better. Had steak which was fair for the price. Mashed potatoes had no taste and looked like cheap instant potatoes. Deseret was sent back as it was cold and not fresh. In the end we paid like $80 for meal. It was a waste of money. Won't go back to this one again.The following pretty much sums up my experience at Zoe's:

Me: "Hi, I'd like the turkey pita please"

Zoe(or sum other dumb bitch): "So you'd like the feta with feta?, would you like something to drink, or maybe a side of feta?"

One word..... Sick! (and I actually like feta... well, used to)
I will not be back.

Oh, and some extremely old dood hit on me while I was waiting for my lunch. Now, while I don't exactly blame that on Miss Zoe, I am convinced that he wouldn't have been there if it weren't for all that feta.

How is there more than one of these shitholes in the valley?? Someone please explain. blech!
2 stars because my Sun Chips hadn't been tampered with... at least to my knowledge.After reading the reviews for this place I was really looking forward to trying it.  I did - and I won't be back.

First impressions weren't great - it's rather dingy and dirty plus the restrooms really needed a cleaning.  It even smells funny.  I tried the vegetable tempura and was quite underwhelmed - no flavor and the provided dipping sauce wasn't great.  I tried a side salad - didn't like their take on dressing.  Then, a few of the more 'conservative' rolls.  I can't say they were horrible but I also can't say they were good.  I even ordered a side of chicken fried rice and found it not good, either.  

I'm guessing that for people who are really into authentic Japanese food or raw sushi this place hits the mark.  However, if you are like me and more of a causal sushi eater then I don't recommend it.We were told great things about this restaurant from a family member and thought we should make reservations for dinner during our stay in Las Vegas.

Overall, our food was not worth the price tag. We asked our waiter for recommendations on wine, appetizers/salads, steaks, etc. His knowledge of the menu didn't seem to be what I was expecting and it seemed like he didn't know what the popular items at the restaurant were. 

Our salads were nothing over the top that we couldn't do ourselves. Honestly, every steakhouse I've had a salad or soup at is always one of a kind. Take it from someone who ate her fair share of steaks in the South! All of our steaks were overcooked from the temperature we asked for. Our wine was more dry and not as sweet as we had expected. I felt that our dessert might have been the only good part to our meal, which wasn't recommended by him, but we read through popular reviews. 

It was very disappointing to have the level of service that we did and I had hoped it would have been more accommodating to someone who was a vegetarian. I know what you're thinking, why would a vegetarian show up to a steakhouse. However, you'd be surprised how accommodating many are willing to be for someone who would like a little more than just a side dish. While I don't expect chefs to create a new meal, to make an added effort/detail to a side dish would have been nice. It also didn't help that our waiter seemed like he was rushing to close up our bill rather than having us enjoy a nice meal. 

Overall our experience, was a complete bust. We've experience better steakhouses in Vegas that have been much more accommodating and notable for their service and food. I definitely wouldn't recommend this steakhouse to people in the future.

I felt the reason they should get one more star is for extra effort in the complimentary glass of prosecco they served us for our anniversaries and taking picture of us from my iphone.The pictures on the website are deceiving. The drive to the hotel was not scenic. In fact, i was starting to doubt my choice in hotels before we even arrived given the appearance of the surrounding area.  The property is in need of updates for sure.  It's definitely showing its age. The pool near the lobby appeared small and cramped.  We checked in and checked out before even seeing our room.  That being said, the front desk staff was pleasant and Im sure the rooms were decent enough just not up to our standards (i could be considered slightly high maintenance).  

We immediately checked into the Farimont Scottsdale Princess and were very happy.  I think Scottsdale is more my speed.I was pretty disappointed with this place.

There was only one type of beef coming around. I am used to several types at my local churrascaria. Peppered, Garlic, this cut, that cut...
Sausages were just ok.
Turkey wrapped in Bacon was probably the best thing they offered me.

The sides/salad bar was pretty small and not a great variety. Which really doesn't matter so much to me because I just get some rice and the powder stuff for dipping the meat in.

Servers were either all robots, or all hungover... no life to them.
And they sure took their sweet time coming out from the back... Don't they know to not keep food from me like that? Maybe that is why the knives were duller than a party at Joe Biden's.
They didn't want me shankin them for the whole skewer of meat.

Caipirinha was OK, but try the White Wine Sangria here... excellent.


Oh- I almost forgot. My coupon for $3 off per person mysteriously vanished from the table.We have several great churrascarias to pick from back home in Dallas and I was excited to see what Vegas had to offer. Unfortunately this place was a disappointment. The selection and quality of both the meats and salad bar paled in comparison to what I was used to. The servers came by pretty infrequently and when they did finally come by the meat they had was often dry and tough. 

This would all be forgivable if the price was right but this place cost as much as the better churrascarias back home. Granted food in Vegas tends to be on the high side but even compared to midrange churrascarias in Dallas this place fell short. 

On the plus side, the drinks were good and strong and the wait staff attentive.Every year, a little shine rubs off of Caesars for me...I love cupcakes, so it was exciting to be in a new state and try a Cupcake War Champion. Being our first time in Phoenix we got lost trying to find this place. We were on 7th Avenue by mistake and then we found 7th Street but they do not have an "Urban Cookies" sign out front, so we passed it. Not fun. When we did get there, it felt dead, the server was not very engaging. They had no chocolate flavors, no brown velvet, no smore cupcakes. Which is a  shame, i really wanted to try the brown velvet, it was the reason we drove to find them. We had a banana cupcake and a lemon cupcake. A banana cupcake is very hard to achieve in my opinion, because it can easily become a dense muffin. Magically they did achieve fluffy cake but was ruined by the dense greasy frosting. It left the greasy coat on my lips. The lemon drop was not my favorite, too sweet. I normally would not get these flavors but since they were out of their star cupcakes we were left with "mehh" cupcakes. A shame.The Party was fun despite the doorman.  I am not used to spending a lot of money on a cabana and being treated so rudely.  He was a jerk and acted like we were such an inconvenience to him.Greetings Yelpers. The sandwich here is pretty good. I took my sister here last night at 930pm. I saw a guy looking at us and getting ready to turn off the "Open" sign. (I thought nothing of it at the time) 

As we walked in the shop, I turned to the guy and said, "Go ahead, turn it off. We are just ordering sandwiches." The cashier simply smiled and just stood there. Some girl (perhaps one of the waitress) said, "Oh, we are out of bread." 

SERIOUSLY?!  It's not even closing time. It's a sandwich shop. 

VERY DISAPPOINTED!The sushi here is not the greatest. Not a very good selection and the rolls lacked in flavor. Definitely won't be going back.Only good thing about this cvs is they take my insurance.....pharmacy is so slow and the drive thru service is terrible....always quicker to just go inside..The service was great but the food was meh.  I've definitely had better.  Ok for a bar and grill but there are better options available.This is not a resort as advertised, and there really is not much to do here.    Seriously, the only food available are Pringles and M&M's sold in the lobby.  The so-called bar has only one white wine  " White Zin." (YUM). The room was missing a reading lamp and the table showed very heavy wear and tear. Check-in took over 40 minutes which, I hear, is typical. What they do have is a "gynormus" pool for children.  And the rooms are big and clean.  There is no wi-fi in the rooms, just in the lobby.  There is an old fashioned wired computer connection in the room that doesn't work for I-phones.  There was a dog barking, nonstop, in the room nearby.  Many people bring pets so watch your step!  Overall, it seems okay if you have dogs and/or kids but bring your own food and wine.Yet another Mexican fast food place made popular by people with no taste buds or basic food knowledge. YAY! I should have knowk by the customer base to turn around and walk right back out the door instead of waiting in line. I need to learn to go with my gut more but no I thought I'd give it a chance and people kept annoying me about the tortillas here. They are giant thin and not even fully cooked tortilla's, so what's so good about them again!?!?! The menu here is pretty damn BORING!! Some basic ass Mexican fare which in some parts of the country none of these items even exist! Just a guess but maybe just maybe some of you were high before going up in this Carolina North!?!? 

My Ma had a green chile burro it was THE worst ever congrats!! It barely had any meat in it or green chile!!! That's right it was a "green chile" burro made with maybe a teaspoon of actual green chile the rest was basically gravy. Not the good kind either I mean a lot of flour and water mixed in to the sauce that it was not even green it was gray!! GROSS!! A gravy burro doesn't sound too appetizing now does it?!?! The green chile burro gets -1 star here people. 

I had the cheese enchiladas w rice and beans. The rice was quite edible not burnt or crunchy but surprisingly fresh tasting and moist. I would eat it again if I had too the beans were not bad either nothing spectacular. Last but not least the cheese enchiladas.....they were good, I ate them and I don't even like red enchilada sauce. 

Now if I was in the area of the original location I would probably give it another go for sure. This location not so much however there is a far better Mexican place up the road that serves way better options and ummm real Mexican food and I don't care if it's cheap here either.Overall, disappointing.  While our huge umbrella drinks were good, the edamame was wilted, and they use long grain rice in their rolls and nigiri!  I'd never seen that before, but it affected the taste and made it hard to handle.  Selection of rolls is somewhat small, too.We haven't been to Panda Express for years. And now we know why. Not good.  I realize its fast food, but so is Chipotle. Everything is fried chicken with honey/orange flavoring sauce. They did have steamed brown/white rice or vegetables but I didn't go there for the healthy options.  The place was somewhat clean and the staff was somewhat friendly...they put food on our plate. I'll be back in another 5 years--maybe.We didn't have a good experience here.   My husband was given a gift certificate for a one hour massage.   I decided to join him and we booked a couples massage.    We got to the resort a little early and hung out at the pool while we waited for our massage.   I then looked around the spa area and was given a brief tour of the area by an attendant.   While I was on my tour I overheard a man say to another man "do you want my 1:30."    I didn't really pay that much attention until they came to get us for our massage.   My husband got a woman and I had the man that was trying to give away the 1:30 appointment which happened to be ME!     Things kind of  went downhill from there.   We were escorted into the couples room for our massage.   I wasn't asked if I wanted any special oils or lotions.  I wasn't asked if I wanted a certain part of my body done or if I was having trouble spots.   Then while doing my massage he didn't do the back upper part of my legs, I had to tell him to do that.    Most of the massages you have the masseuse does your whole body without being told what to do.   I just feel like it was a burden for this man to do the massage. For the prices they charge and the "so-called" reputation they have I expected better.   I don't remember his name but the person my husband had was Jeanie (I think).  She has been there about 15 years and she was excellent.   She did an excellent job on my husband and didn't have to be told what to do.   My husband stated she did parts of his neck that he wasn't even aware he had muscles.    There are better places for less money.   I didn't think the spa rooms were that great either.    Also, they didn't give you any pre-spa services such as the heated neck pad while you wait for your massage.I stop here on occasion when I'm not feeling lazy and crave a better tasting coffee outside of starbucks drive thru. Always see the same guy working solo which can get a bit annoying if there's a line and I'm in hurry but no big deal. My last visit there will he just that, my LAST. He was more interested in chatting with his wife then he was in serving the 3 or 4 people waiting in line. I probably spent at least 15 minutes just standing there waiting. This to me is unprofessional and uncalled for.Dr. DeBaker sent me here for an assessment, but they seemed more concerned about hitting me up for money to pay for a root canal BEFORE they even did the assessment to determine whether or not I should get a root canal in the first place. This is obviously a place of business where their first priority is maximizing the money they extract from each patient and NOT what is in the patient's best interest!

Once I got in the dentist's chair, the Dr. came in and convinced me that I needed another root canal. Wham, bam and 30 minutes later I was out of the chair and paying the bill... I only went here for an assessment! Anyways, I think the Doctor who worked on me did a great job, was very skilled and highly efficient, plus he got a second opinion from one of the other doctors... But, make no mistake, this practice is a money generating enterprise with little concern for their patient's best interests.  The receptionist reminds me of a mafia bill collector!Should not have the word Phoenix in it's name, because it is nowhere near Phoenix!  It's a fucking hour away!  Also had very bad luck with Allegiant Airlines, as both my flight in and out were 90 minutes late.  I also experienced a gate agent who, in the spirit of spring training, was a major league bitch.  No carry-on food available inside the security area either, only dine in.  I won't fly back into Mesa unless it's absolutely necessary.Oh my. I really wanted to like this place more because there aren't many Filipino food choices in Phoenix, but it was just ok.

The saving grace of this place was their special seafood layout (don't really know the official name of it) that we ordered on a Sunday at lunch time. It is only available at lunchtime and it consists of grilled shrimp, fish, rice and 2 sides all laid out on a table size platter of banana leaves. I went with 3 others and it was only $30! It was delicious!

But then comes the bad part--I've had some of their prepared foods in the little trays and they were not very good. I am a huge kare-kare lover and it was not the creamy, savory stew I was used to. 

Also, their halo-halo and sago gulaman was.....HORRENDOUS! OMG I did NOT think it was possible to mess up such simple amazing desserts!!! The sago and jellies were so rock-hard and unappealing and the halo halo hardly had any filling. The crazy thing is they have a little section in the restaurant with grocery racks of Filipino foods, including the jars with the standard halo-halo ingredients! Why didn't they seem to use these??

I would not recommend any of their regular food. But if you're looking for a unique Sunday lunch, you should try out their grilled seafood special.I've never eaten a mouthful of sand, but if I did, I can't imagine it would taste much different than the rice and beans served at Tacos Del Mar. 

If it is the goal of TDM to produce the most bland tasting Mexican food on the planet, they are doing a pretty good job.

In addition to the rice and beans, not much can be said for their dry, flavor-free steak as well.  If you're into eating cardboard, I suggest you try TDM's steak tacos. You'll be in heaven.

I'd give the place one star if it weren't for the friendly employees. Those bastards.Hire some damn cashiers!!!!!!!!I used to come here 5 yrs ago all the time and they did great jobs. So I bought these groupon deals and I come here. The front ticket guy tries to uprade me to leather wipes. I decline. And with a smart ass tone said "only guy today that doesnt want it. Guess you'll be sliding around". I do sales for a living and being a ass is no way to upsell a customer. Then I asked him for new car smell. He then told me "wow, you come in with a groupon ticket and you expect car scent too"? I gotta say this place has gone down the drain. This is no way to talk to a customer.  Gotta say ill be heading back to full circle after my groupons are used.Sometimes friendly and attentive service, edible food, and plain decor. Yep, it sure is a chain restaurant! BWW is actually one of my favorite chain restaurants. Note: the word "favorite" is being used loosely there. Much like a dental check-up is my favorite dentist experience. If you gotta go, try the mango habanero or the Caribbean jerk sauces. They are solid.This review is for service only. Which by the way after bad, really bad service makes the food a little blah!
We order some stuffs totalling $31. Two half salads, half sandwich. Two sodas and kids meal plus a cookie for my daughter. 
The cashier kristen, as her name appears in my receipt has been the worst person i have ever have to deal with, in years. 
Out of it and most important, very rude!! like giving her my order annoyed her to death.  Short in answers as well. I order two drinks but she charged for one only so when i asked her to add a second one. She rolled her eyes at me and slammed the cup in the counter like i was a toddler bothering her.   And I wont even bother to comment about her attitude when i gave her my Panera card to be swipped. The only reason i give it 2 stars is because the runner/busser was amazing and deserves to be recongnized. I dont remember her name, someone called her 'G' or 'B' or something like that. 
Anyway, the food was good but didnt enjoyed it at all.  
I wont be going there anymore. I will have to go to the one on green valley next timeAwesome concept, great location, terribly small and poorly laid out.

There are two halves of The District of so it would seem.  The Cheesecake Factory and Whole Foods side should be combined with the Williams Sonoma Kings Fish House side.  There is a major road between the two.  

The planning people in Northern Virginia should have been consulted on this project because Reston Town Center is awesome and this area would have done extremely well with a project like that. 

This is OK and is home to some great restaurants so I will return.I was not at all happy with my visit to Canyon Ranch last Wednesday. Wow, I expected sooo much better from this place. Let me just say if you don't read the rest of this review...just go to Qua in Caesar's....it's way better.

I only paid the $40 to use the general facilities and decided to skip the $175 facial I had booked. IMO, that's a bit much for a facial. After tip it would be over $200. Anyway, once I paid I walked into the locker room area. There were maybe five of us lined up there waiting for the attendent to come back after giving someone a tour. Why weren't there more attendents? Ok, fine, whatever. A few of us walked together to be shown the place, very briefly, she didn't walk us around or anything, just basically pointed and gestured but then again she really didn't have the time to take us on a full tour. The place is HUGE though so you kind of need some direction if you have never been there before. The attendent gave me a little locker key on a rubber wrist bracelet and I couldn't believe I had to walk around with this thing on my wrist all day. I am used to those lockers where you just punch in your 4 digit code and go on your way. The next thing that sucked were the flip flops they give you to wear. Seriously, they actually hurt my feet with all these hard little nubby things on them. Weird. 

I figured the first thing I would do would be to relax in the jacuzzi/whirlpool...not happening! I went into the room where they have ONE whirlpool. Yes, one....and it was about the size of a king sized bed.  Two women were in the two spots made to lay back on and then there were two women on the other side of them. There wasn't really any more room after that. I'm not getting into a whirlpool and being all up on someone. It wouldn't be too relaxing for either of us. (As a sidenote, you should see the whirlpool/bath area at Qua. It's unbelieveable)

So I left out of there and headed to the area where you wait to have a treatment. This area was very nice and had cozy and comfortable seating. The refreshments weren't that great though. Just some tea, coffee and water and then there was some fruit.

I left there and asked someone how to get to the "wave" room I heard so much about. After about a ten minute walk I found it and it was pretty stupid. You lay in these leather chairs and incline backwards like you are looking up into a dome thing and there are wave sounds and bird sounds....it sounded way better then it actually was.  I decided to get my $40 worth and lay here and relax for a bit. I don't know if it was people who worked there or other guests but I kept hearing the door slam about every five minutes or so. Not relaxing.  Also the room was completely empty the whole time I was there and I bet that's probably because other guests didin't even know it is there.

I made the long trek back to the lockers in my nubby, hurty flip flops. I should have just taken them off but I felt weird about it. I got dressed and got the heck out of there. Major waste of $40 in my opinion. It was so crowded, too, for a Wednesday. I wonder what it is like in there on a Saturday. I don't know, I don't get what the hoopla is about this place. I would never go back and would tell others not to go. They need to take a page from Qua's book. But you can see my review for Qua for that story. Again, I didn't have a treatment so I can't say anything about that. I also did not go in the steamroom or sauna but I took a peek and they looked crowded.The food was good, the service was horrendous. Our waitress Carroll  literally kept forgetting about us. Took forever to even come to our table to take our drink order. By time she arrived we knew what we wanted to eat. We asked for a drink  menu, yet another long wait. Ordered our drinks. Another long weight. Asked us if we wanted dessert twice. I'm literally writing this as I wait for our check, it's that bad.This restaurant is very basic, serving as both a restaurant and banquet hall.  On this Saturday evening a large group from Nellis Airforce base occupied 2 long banquet tables with the remaining diners scattered around the large room.   

We shared a delicious appetizer of Kashk-E-Bademjan, fried eggplant mixed with Kashk (whey) flavored with sauteed garlic and mint. We also shared an order of Shiraz, a Persian salad of fresh chopped cucumbers, tomatoes, parsley, onion and house dressing that was less satisfying.  Ann's entrée was Fesenjon, fried walnut pomegranate sauce, mixed with boiled chicken and a side of Basmati rice.  My entrée was another stew, Baghali Polo, basmati rice mixed with fresh dill and lima beans served with a cooked lamb shank in tomato sauce.  The amount of rice served was almost overwhelming.    

The owner, Amy, stopped by our table to inquire how we enjoyed our meal and ended up sitting with us for a half hour while we enjoyed complimentary orders of baklava and tea.  

I would rate this restaurant 2.5 Stars.Man, I really wanted to love this place... The inside of the store is super clean, they have a nice selection of air fresheners, cards, stuffed animal things for the kids, water, soda and some snacks.

It was about 20 bucks with a tip, not bad really. Fairly quick as well 20ish min.
((secret over share)) I know the carwash business really well ((really, really well))...

I was not a happy camper, at all. If I had had the time I would have made them do it over, and over until they got it right. The back window was not even touched inside, at all. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy on the interior, did they vacuum it? I have no idea, did not look like it to me. Inside windows a joke. Outside? UUGGHHHH!! the underside of the door untouched wwaaahhhtttt?? You have to try really hard not to wash that. There was something on the rags they used to dry off my poor car, that now needs to be re-washed and waxed. It looks like sap, ya flippin tree sap! My car is kept in the garage and I NEVER park it under filthy bird holding trees!

Super upset. If you have your car washed here, you better be on them like white on rice, point out whatever you feel they have missed, and make them go over it, until it is right. If one of my car washes turned out work like this I would have been out of business in a hot second. A child would have tried harder.

They get 2 stars, for location. Hopefully, they can step up their game...I really wanted to like this place.  I had high expectations after reading some of the yelp reviews.  However, I left a bit disappointed and unsatisfied.  It is a beautiful restaurant with ultra chic decor.  The winding staircase and hanging glass balls are a nice touch.  I originally wanted to give it a 3, but the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a lower review.  

First of all, my BF and I were seated at the opposite end of where we wanted to sit (the side facing the strip).  We got bread with two kinds of butter.  Regular and peanut butter butter.  I didn't really like the peanut butter butter very much.  And the bread was difficult to cut.  I like it when they give you bread that's already cut up so all you have to do is tear it off from the bread bowl.  Especially when you're sharing with a group of people.  Who wants to eat it after someone grabs it with their hands and cuts it up. 

I wasn't very hungry so decided to not do the prixe fixe meal and instead decided to get 2 appetizers and a salad for my entree.  We got the foie gras and tuna tartare to start.  It was good, but I've definitely had better.   My $20 appetizer salad was light and refreshing but still left me unsatisfied.  My BF got the lobster with rice and I must say that it was delicious.  For $50, it better be!  

The wine: we opted to share a bottle of Pinot Grigio.  The wine guy, likely not a master sommelier barely said a word.  My BF tried the wine and he approved and said would you like to try it? The guy starts pouring me a full glass.  I guess we are getting this bottle whether I like it or not.  

The service:   Umm service was not great.  Just mediocre.  Our waiter was nice and took some pics for us but the host was not so friendly.  We had a restaurant.com gift certificate but didn't print it out and asked if we could still use it.  It was in email format and my BF pulled it up on his phone.  At first they said that it was fine and later French host dude with an attitude came back and said sorry our mistake, that was for someone else.  But said that we would get something complimentary from the chef.  I was excited, yay! free stuff.  They brought out this drink in a martini glass.  French dude said, it's non-alcoholic because "I'm not sure if you're 21."  I don't know whether he was trying to be funny or not, because clearly I was drinking wine all night already and was still sipping on my last glass when he came.  So I decided to try it.  It was not good.  Then I looked over the other tables and saw that people got the same thing.  It could be that they may very well have ordered that.  Or the chef was just giving those away to everybody that night.  

Overall, food was pretty good, but for the price, I also expect stellar service.  This restaurant did not meet my expectations.People rock, but car was the worst. Went from a Mercedes last time to a Mitsubishi this time, both are considered the same car class, haven't figured that out. The quality of car was something I would expect to find at an auction house, NOT at a Hertz location. 
Better luck next time...so my hair is very long and i am verrrrry particular about it. upon deciding between two salons to go get a hair cut, i called curl up n dye where i was greeted on the phone with a monotone, bored voice  saying "Curl up n dye..." who was literally yawning while talking to me. nothing at all to really make me want to check this place out. the polar opposite of how i was greeted from the other salon. Chose the other place because the receptionist actually made me feel like they wanted to cut my hair.Cook shows up late, manager is always angry, and comps for gambling are inconsistent.  

Used to be a regular spot for night shifters getting off in the morning... now its dead.  

Treat your regulars well... it pays off in the end.the food was pretty good, but we wanted to take advantage of the check in offer of 1/2 off an appetizer and when i showed the waitress she went 'WHAT IS THAT!??!?!' all amazed and confused about the mysterious yelp.

now i'm not about to fight someone over a $5 discount, but she didn't even bother to ask the manager or another server. so that part was lame.   

the next day we needed to break a $20 to get on the bus so we stopped in here and the same server gave my bf sh** about breaking the bill and guilt tripped him for not buying anything.  seriously? seriously. rude. no thanks.This place is at a nice location, nothing special... The guy that did my mani/ pedi did a fast job and it was decent. They don't do designs/ airbrush or anything particularly advanced, it's pretty cheap as well... you get what you pay for. I wouldn't call it 'excellent'.This is my first hotel review. 

I will never stay at Trump International again. 

We stayed in a beautiful modern suite on the 57th floor.  The room was amazing! The bathroom, awesome.. especially the tub!  However, the suite we were in (5722)... the sheets were dirty and the towels were dirty...the light bulb was out, the tv was out, the iron didn't work, the cabinet hinge was broken, the coffee pot filter was dirty - even after 4 times of putting the water through....  but all of that i can let slide... 

The worst part about staying here was the noise at night.. no not noise from your neighbors.. It appears that Donald did not have his hotel sound proofed so even on the 57th floor you can hear the train down the street, sirens and cars... not to mention that the trains blow their horn 3-4 times when passing by... A train goes by every 2 hours or so, so good luck sleeping at night.. (even my ear plugs did not work)...  

overall, it is a beautiful looking hotel with a great addition that there is no casino and night life. it's quiet and you don't have to breathe in second hand smoke... but our room experience was so bad that we will never stay here again.The service really sucks!
When we arrived at 4pm and checked in, we were told that our room has not been ready yet and will be ready soon. We we're put to wait for almost one hour but they still haven't contact us.
So I have to wait another long line. The front desk just poker face the whole time and really impatient at all.
I give 2 stars only because the room look alright. But I give 0 star for the serviceAte here months ago.  Was excited to finally find a Phoenix sushi venue, and one that also offered brown rice as a sub for sushi dishes (don't quote me on this however, since it has been many months and I may be recalling another venue).  

One item did impress me, and that was the complimentary appetizer that was comprised of tempura'd chips with perhaps a squid salad topping (?)  I should have just ordered another serving of this!  Instead, I tried an Ao Yasai (mixed gourmet greens with ginger) and a sushi roll w/ brown rice, the latter I thought was price-y considering the very small portion given.  I was so unimpressed by its unexciting flavors that I don't even recall what kind of roll I tried!  Pretty sad, I know.  

I told myself I wouldn't go back, but I would like to give Hana another try, perhaps for lunch and/or dinner with a group of friends and have apps and wine/sake!I was so excited to try a Mario Batali restaurant after watching him on Food Network.  I thought.. if he's the chef with the highest winning record on Iron Chef, he's got to be awesome.  So sure.. I'll shell out the Las Vegas prices and try his amazing Italian food.

I went here because B&B was closed.  It is in a cute setting.. you feel like you're in Italy sitting in a square.  The menu is overpriced.  I think it was like $3 for a slice of carpaccio.. seriously?

Bread wasn't even fresh and warm.. it was pre wrapped and burnt (well the first one was).  And you have to ask for olive oil and cheese.  Why does this not come standard?

We ordered the braised pork shoulder which is the staff's favorite (according to our waiter) and the carbonera (daily special for pasta).  The braised pork shoulder was okay.. not really tender and not really uniform in tenderness.  Some really tough parts and some not.. and a little too sweet.  The cucumbers that came with it were good.  

And the pasta.. was okay.  $25 for a small plate of pasta?  Really?  And it wasn't even meaty or amazing.  That cost about $1 to make and they made $25 from it.

The waiter was nice.. but didn't seem knowledgable.  I am sorry Mario.. you lost me.  I am going to have to believe that there is no such thing as good food from a celebrity chef.it is goodwill.. u know what to expect =)Two stars feels a little harsh but Macaynot's just didn't quite measure up to the standard for Mexican in the valley.  One of the restaurants I held up as a standard to judge Macaydon't's against is a little hole in the wall Mexican place near my office.  The food there is less diverse but more authentic and better than Macayshouldn't's and for the price much better.

So if I can get better than Macayno's and more authentic than Macaykeepgoingo's and cheaper than Macaymovealongthere'sbetterandcheaperMexicandowntheroadalittleway's than why I am going to eat there?

They do have a nice outdoor seating area on a pond that features large warning signs about not feeding the birds as well as diners feeding the birds and a live demonstration on the mercenary behavior of birds when they get used to people feeding them and practically land on your plate to grab a peck or two.

The food came out very quickly at Macayhuh's and the service was very good.  Everything slowed to a crawl for some reason when we asked for a box and the check.

Don't get the wrong impression, Macaysosofood's is OK, it's not bad by any stretch.  I would eat here if someone else was buying for sure.  I had a fish taco (overdone) and blue corn enchilada which was OK.Went here for a nice dinner before a show at the Mirage. Wished we had gone somewhere else. Our waitress hovered near our table the entire dinner, very awkward. We had the potstickers which were good, the chicken chow mein and the kung pow chicken were tasteless with zero flavor. Save your money!I was really disappointed in this place.  Kung pao chicken and roasted duck and it was very expensive and not so good.  You'd think with all the Asians gambling around they'd take a little more care in the kind of Chinese food they offer.

I passed up Panda Express and wish I hadn't.I first heard about this Filipinos fast food joint when I was in Honolulu a few weeks ago. They just opened one up in Waipahu. There was such a long line up there everyday that I didn't even bother to go there. One day while I was driving along Maryland Parkway and happened to see the big sign of Jollibee on the wall next to the Filipino super market "Seafood City". Since I didn't see any line up, I decided to try out this place. Surprisingly, there was no one at the counter ordering and only 4 customers eating and this was lunch time! Someone told me to try their fried chicken but I opted instead for the Palabok Fiesta because it's healthier....LOL. I was disappointed as the portions were very small. 

I guess my taste buds are not used to eating Filipino food as I found the rice noodles overcooked and not that flavorful.  I don't think I would go back there again.  Sorry!Went here for dinner last night.  I was really excited after reading all of the reviews, but...

Greek salad was good, but I didn't go for the salad.  I wanted pizza.

When our pie arrived, it looked good.  When I picked it up, the crust was nice...bendable, but sturdy enough to support the toppings.  When I tasted it, that's where things went south.

Out toppings were jalapeno, feta and spinach, which is our standard for judging pies for the first time.  Red sauce was on the light side.  Cool...not everyone is a fan of red sauce.  I can deal with that.  But, the flavors of the ingredients (including the mozz) seemed to be missing.  It was weird.  It was like there just wasn't enough salt or something...you could kinda get the tastes, but not really.  

I want to go back and give this a second try, but I don't know.Not the best mall to shop few chain stores nothing great. Mainly just get harassed by the sales people trying to sell you everything at the kiosk stands. I found this place somewhat annoying to shop.Went to Planet Dailies with my wife on a Wednesday morning. The food was over priced and cooked improperly. They messed up our order and we had to wait 15 minutes after we both finished eating before we got a side of corned beef hash. Our server was fairly attentive and friendly, however he kept telling us our corned beef hash would be out in 2 minutes, even though it took like 15.This place is really starting to show its age. I came here 10 years ago and was pleasantly surprised at how much different merchandise was offered - there were even 2 stores that specialized in anime/video games/figures/etc. 

Long story short, those last 10 years were not kind to this place. Neither one of those stores is still here.

There are some diverse, interesting things to be had in here, but a lot of it is junk too. You have to pay a dollar just to get into the place, which is annoying, especially when you consider that the long-gone Swap Mart in Henderson didn't charge for admission. How I miss that place.

The place is set up in a confusing layout. If you follow one path, you'll find yourself going around strange corners and ending up backtracking unintentionally a lot. It's hard to explain, but one visit will clear up what I'm talking about. 

It's hard to really make any specific points as to how downhill this place has gone, but put simply, it isn't what it used to be. There are too many vendors selling overpriced junk, and not enough selling the merchandise that actually interests this reviewer. Check the place out if you happen to be in the neighborhood, but keep your expectations in check.The service here was very friendly and fast.

We ordered the brie appetizer, which was very good.

The salmon entree was a little fishy and overcooked. The spinach ravioli was just okay - the sauce was decent.

The sundae for dessert was good as well. 

All in all, we had a decent meal, but we would have been happier if we didn't have to pay as much for the food. It isn't quite worth the price.Great place to watch a game unless you want to see the last two minutes. i was in this past sunday to watch football, place was busy, but not crowded by any means. menu was typical of a sports bar, nothing too fancy and the prices seemed pretty high. my big issue was for some reason while the first round of games was ending the tvs just started changing channels. it appeared that there was one customer who wanted to watch the giants game (that was already a blowout) and the manager tried to change one channel and all of a sudden multiple games were being changed. there were quite a few of upset customers, trying to watch their games and then having something else put on in front of them. this lasted for a few minutes when someone who i though was a customer at the time helped the female manager, so i guess he worked there???
there were several people around me saying they would never come back, and honestly i am probably one of them as well.First and last time i go into this place...  Let me say first that I have always wanted to come here just to have a sit down with friends and drinks, but it so happens my son and I walked in one day after a busy day of errands.  I did not want to cook and it was on our way home.  I was disappointed right off the bat because we sat down and I don't know what, because it was just me and my son, but no one wanted the table, (I know how it is, i used to wait tables) but we waited patiently and after about 10 minutes server came over and said he did not see us and apologized.  More than likely taking a smoke break due to he smelled like smoke.  We ordered nachos and cheese sticks, (weren't very hungy) and they were fine.  My complaint to this place would be that I went to ask if they had SunBru from Four Peaks and in Tempe you should be carrying FourPeaks anything at all times, in my opinion!  The server I asked said yes they had it and then my server came back to get my drink order. I asked and he said he would check and came back and said infact no they did not have it.  I settled for an FP 8th street Ale.  The server seemed nervous checking on us, not sure was that was about but he rarely came by, my son was never offered a refill on his drink and I was not offered another beer... seemed weird for a bar... anyway we waited about 10 minutes for the check and when we walked out after completing the transaction, no one said a word to us.  Very strange place.  I can see the neighborhood bar attraction and I wish it was different but I will not set foot in this place again.  Will stick with the ol standby, Four Peaks and never stray again!If Eva's was located next to a Taco Bell I would be stumped as to which I would prefer.

Pros. Hmmm......the parking lot is never over full.They have a great patio close to my work so we come here sometimes for happy hour. Don't waste your money on the food. It's horrible. And sometimes it seems near impossible getting the staff to get you chips and salsa and then to get refills. The only plus I can really think of it the patio.I spent a lot of time thinking about reviewing this place. I held off for a lot of personal reasons. 1 I used to work here. But being unbiased...There are a few things I'm bitter about but it's mainly with the owner. Most of my friends refuse to deal with Trader Vic's because of me. But overall....If you're on the strip it's easy to get to. But if you park in PH Valet...Not so bad. If you park in Miracle Mile Parking...It's like a Lord of the Rings quest. Ya if you don't know your way around - you can walk in circles. When you get there, the hostess stand is in front and you can't tell if it's a restaurant. When you walk in, it's a little more posh than most other TVs. 
Apps: I like the coconut chicken. I hate the prices. I like the Kahlua pork sliders....but it's not Kahlua pork. It's like pork in a sweet sauce. The food is not cheap. Believe me for the quality and size of portions - it sucks. Lobster Potstickers YUM. Satay is ok - I mean I've had authentic - so when I taste this stuff, it's just ok.
Main courses: My faves are usually the chef specials. They had Ribeye once which was great. All in Fried Rice was good. Not worth 20 bucks but it's not bad. It's hard to say. I haven't been there since February - so I don't remember the food....so its kinda forgetable?
Breakfast is good if they still serve it. The waffles yum. The stuffed french toast is amazing....
Drinks: I developed the Wasabi Mary. So of course YUM. I also developed the Coconut Raspberry chocolate Frappe. YUM
Mai Tai is good if made right. Originally they use Fresh Lime Juice - this place uses lemon concentrate for some reason. You have to order it from scratch otherwise they use a Mai Tai syrup for speed. Most of the other drinks. Taste the same all citrusy. The bowls eh can be worth it usually they have 6-8 ounces of liquor in it. But its better between two people otherwise there's no point to getting a buzz. 
So definitely one up on the view. But it's true - this place is boring. They run out of liquor a lot. It's not FUN like it used to be. Eh...View one star, some drinks half star, some staff, half star.I've passed this place so many times and finally got to go in it. 
It's located right by the Monte Carlo and it always looked packed from the outside. So for a Halloween weekend I was very surprised how not busy it was on the inside. We had reservations so our host told us to go upstairs and our waitress would show us our seat. 
The view was great and luckily it was nice outside when we started dinner. Here is where the problems started though. The table we got was lopsided. It was one of the low tables with the couches and I've never had such a lopsided tabled before. I ended up sticking my menu under it to keep it balanced. She took our drink orders and my boyfriend doesn't drink so he ordered a pink lemonade and I got a strawberry daiquiri. Our friend's ended up just getting a beer and a water. 
After a good while our waitress comes over and brings us our drinks. She put down a margarita on the edge of the table and we didn't notice until my boyfriend looks for his pink lemonade. Took her another ten minutes to come back over and we tell her the mistake. She was apologetic and let us have it for free since it wasn't even our drink. I don't know where she kept going though because it took her a good while to come back with his drink again but she gave him two to make up for it. She took our orders. I ordered the baby back ribs, my boyfriend the Combo nachos, both friends ended up getting the chicken burrito. One of them asked for no sauce on the burrito.
They brought out the food and the server handed her a burrito with sauce on it. She even asked him "this is the one with no sauce right?" and he told her yes it was. He handed us the rest of the food and the waitress told him that the order was wrong and she apologized again and took it back for her.
It took her at LEAST twenty minutes to get her a new burrito, luckily we all gave her parts of our food.
Here's a lowdown on the food we got. 
Ribs were good, came with coleslaw and onion rings. The ribs were dryer than I usually like it but each to their own, I enjoyed them.
The nachos were FANTASTIC defiantly one of the best nachos I've ever gotten to try. They also should be shared with at least three people. Got lots of left overs on that one.
Friends said their burritos were good but were not fond of how spicy the beans were. If you like really spicy you will like their beans.
Chips and salsa were good. Friend said she really liked the salsa.
Calamari was good, nothing special though
Potato skins were good too.
If they just improve their service I would defiantly rate this restaurant higher.Earl of Sandwiches, the greatest food for drunks, but not when one is sober! 4.5 stars is far too generous for this place. In closing it's just a sandwich joint with one type of bread.You think you will sit and rest your aching feet while having a drink and maybe a little food but the water s deafening.  Literally shouting at people sitting at your table.  Tables are packed tight too.  Only bottled beer no draft.  $7 for a blue moon is a rip off.  I didn't pay that in Rome in front of the real Trevi fountain!!!  The calamari was ok.  Brushetta was lacking in taste, dont waste your money on it.  The pizza's looked good but for $17 they should.  Tourist trap for sure!We ordered the sweet sticks from this place and it was not that tasty.  I think I like Auntie Annies better.  The gourmet carmel apples looked great but expensive... $12-apple!Its not bad but its the worst Ive had in Henderson. It was late and this was close to my house. If you can go to most any other place on henderson. "I luv Sushi" is my favorite the other reviews are fairly accurate about this place. I wouldnt avoid this place. I just wouldnt seek it out.I went over there because I was feeling good and thought I would buy a couple of cute bra, I could have went to fashion square but why not try this place ,I had to look for someone to help me and when I found one, some idiot have left one of the drawer open and I scratched my leg, I was trying to tell the sales lady, she didn't give too rats ass she was more interested on selling me a bra, I wasn't trying to get free shit, so my night was ruined and I will probably will not be back to that store and tell my female friends not to go there and co workers.Okay, I've been neglecting my review writing lately but had to pick up the keyboard and yelp out against the travesty that is a 5 star review given to LOVE.

First of all, nothing against my fellow yelpers out there but how can you give even 4 stars to a show that touts the Cirque du Soleil title but fails to give anything acrobatic or show stoppingly amazing than a few rollerbladers on ramps!?

There are many ways to lose money in Vegas...Blackjack, Paigow, Craps...and unfortunately...LOVE. I've never felt so ripped off in my life! well, besides that time I ordered sea monkeys but I digress...

LOVE is basically like listening to a Beatles CD at home while watching Soul Train and flipping to the X-games during commercial breaks. Ugh! If you want to pay $100 bucks to do this, be my guest. But do not deceive others by saying this was a great show for the money. 

Trust me, I've seen every Cirque show in Vegas...spend the extra money to watch "O" or less to watch Mystere even. You will be amazed, entertained, and witness to true death defying acts...Most importantly, you'll feel that it was worth the price.

Sorry Beatles, no LOVE from this guy. Go dance around and rollerblade to "I wanna hold your hand" on someone else's dime.I was warned.

I got called out to come here by some friends on a Thursday night and the experience went as such:

Enter to be carded by a young lady at the hostess stand. Which is completely okay, I'm in my late twenties I don't mind being carded.

I make my way to my friends and am informed of karaoke and a lack of waitresses. No sweat I say, I'll hit the bar. 

I visit the bar and notice the giant wall of TVs, plenty of space to sit and a patio. Good stuff so far.

The bartender cards me yet again and then gives me a wristband to prove my age. I oblige but can't help but wonder why the lady at the door didn't perform this function as well, odd. 

My Kiltlifter is served in a plastic cup. Now, I work in a bar, we serve in plastic when we're at or close to max capacity. There were _maybe_ 20 customers in the building. We sometimes get rowdy, but I doubt enough to warrant plastic, so what's the deal?

The beer was as it should be, cold and foamy. We also ended up with shots, as our resident karaoke queen needed her nightly round. Interestingly enough the shots came in standard glassware. 

No one ordered food, so I'll not comment on the supposed quality. I wouldn't expect much though.

The patio was visited as I chatted with a surly Scottish gentleman smoker. I definitely would like to see this patio during a nice spring/fall day. Looked great during the evening.

The restrooms were not visited on this maiden voyage, so I cannot comment on the condition. After reading the previous reviews I'm perfectly okay with that.

I'd give it another shot, but I wouldn't recommend the place to someone looking for sports, beer or karaoke even. It was par to sub-par all around. Bummer, as it's a nice building and in a great location.Icon, you've left me speechless--and not in a good way.  Luckily, I can still write!

I have been coming here for years, and I adore the Iconic tapas...particularly anything involving short ribs or flank steak.  Or flatbreads.  Somehow, it has always slipped my mind to yelp about this place. So it's very IRONIC that last night, when I visited with the full intention of remedying that oversight, Icon fell flat on its face.

I'm incredibly cranky about this whole experience, and I am not going to pull any punches.  Here's how it went down.  I signed myself and my sister up for the Valentine's day prix fixe menu.  $48 per plate.  4 courses.  ICON.  Money well spent, right? WRONG!  I had issues with EVERY course.  Not to mention that we had our coats on for the entire meal to ward off the arctic blasts each time the door opened.  

Now, I have to say that I went against my better judgement, which tells me to avoid seafood in the Midwest.  However, it WAS featured prominently on a very expensive menu, so I thought what the hell?  I bit: I went with the crab cakes in the first course.  They made me want to jump the first plane to Maryland so I could remind myself what good crab cakes taste like.  The crab had that distinctive frozen flavor (that you wouldn't expect in a high-end establishment).  The cakes were otherwise dense and semi-gross.  But I dug the saffron aioli...for whatever that's worth. 

For the second course, I chose the CREAM OF asparagus soup.  I can't stress this enough: any chef should be embarrassed by what we were served.  I emphasize "cream of," because the soup clearly had not been uniformly puréed and strained, as evidenced by the occasional spoonful of overcooked asparagus chunks.  Moreover, the soup was crying out for salt--which was notably absent from our table.  Really? REALLY?!

THIS IS BASIC STUFF, PEOPLE.  

For the entree I chose lobster pappardelle, which was okay, but not memorable.  My sister picked the standout of the meal: the porcini and truffle ravioli was fantastic, and I would have licked her plate if nobody else had been in the room. 

And dessert? I opted for the chocolate mousse.  The presentation was a curious cross between something my puppy would have done and liver pate with birthday candles.  I did venture a taste, and it was fine--but again, not memorable.  I didn't detect the cardamom.

So in short, I am pissed that I spent $48 per plate for a meal that was poorly executed.

So, Icon...maybe I'll be back someday.  Maybe I'll write a glowing update.  But right now, I just don't see it.Pappadeaux is overpriced and overrated.  There are so few choices in seafood restaurants in the Phoenix area.  It's a shame.  Franchise.  The food is ok.  One step up from Red Lobster.If you would think visiting this restaurant at 8pm on a Saturday night would be a prime opportunity to experience what "Sushi Eye in Motion" is all about - you would be wrong. At least, I would hope you were wrong. If this service was indicative of what the restaurant is at their best, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

I was in a party of three sitting down at the bar, hoping to make a number of selections from the rotating sushi bar - but the items I saw were not to my liking (lots of spicy tuna) and they looked as though they had been there for some time.

Now here's where it gets awful - those same items rotated around the entire time I was there. 50+ minutes and those were the only items I saw on the rotating bar. We ordered a small number of things to start off (I always make sure to get 'saba' and 'ikura' at every sushi place I go to) with the intention of grabbing some plates off the conveyor belt, but there were never any plates added.

The stuff we ordered was good. The mackerel was delicious and the salmon roe was good. Everything else was decent, but the dissatisfaction with the failure to deliver on their gimmick was enough to dissuade my appetite. If I ever went back, or if you ever decide to go, I would sit at the bar and have a drink first. Just watch and see if they add anything new to the rotation or if there's any variety. If there isn't, I would leave and go somewhere better (I love Kabuki at Tempe Marketplace).

Imagine how horrible it would be for anyone to sit down after we had left and grab some of the sushi that had likely been there for an hour or more. To quote one of my favorite videos on YouTube - "unforgivable."Meh:  Go there because work is near by.  I think the food is over priced but dependable.  The pastas are the best best or the sandwich by itself.  Don't make the mistake of ordering a side of pasta which will net you a smallish cup (amounting to two forkfulls of pasta) for like four bucks.  Okay for a quick work bite.On an arid Arizona day, nothing sounds more refreshing than an icy margarita. You may be lured in with the tropical atmosphere. You may succumb to the charming (yet repetitive music). The decor is the best to offer.

Let me spare you the disappointment and say don't eat here for lunch or dinner. Just about everything you can order here makes it taste like the poor man's red lobster, and is even more expensive. Get the bang for your buck and avoid ordering anything but the generous portion of nachos (only above average dish as far as taste and value), and the perfect margarita (only drink guaranteed to NOT be short-poured).

If you visit Westgate on a Saturday night, you may be tempted to visit again. They book some live bands who do some pretty good covers. Speaking of covers, there isn't one to get in!

Don't worry, you'll pay handsomely for that at the bar. Six dollars for a 20 oz. Coors Light? Jolly rancher shots that are 50% cranberry juice? All from bartenders who spend more time tossing around bottles of bottom-shelf swill than actually learning how to make a drink. If you're already a bit buzzed, and want some good live music with a nice crowd, this will be an ok way to end your Saturday night. Unless you talk to security...they're jerks.

1/5 as a restaurant, 3/5 as a bar/club.Disappointing. My mom and I stopped by here after some late afternoon shopping, as it is located inside Scottsdale Fashion Square, and we were looking to party for our last night in town. We ordered a couple margaritas, and they were intensely sweet and too strong to enjoy. (Don't get me wrong, I enjoy getting my money's worth when I order a drink but there is a difference between a stiff drink and one that is so strong you don't want to drink it.) We ordered chips and salsa for an appetizer while we looked over the menus. Again, we were prepared to stay a while. It actually took 20 minutes for us to see our chips and salsa. The presentation was nice, and it included 3 different salsas to try. The chips were crisp and fresh. We were not offered any cornbread that other tables were getting. By the time we had finished the bowl of chips, we had not been offered any more drinks, or asked for our food orders. It wasn't very busy, so I was confused as to what was taking so long. Since I work in the industry, I think I show more patience than most, but this was just pathetic. Finally a second bartender came on and asked if we were doing okay and we asked for our bill. From the moment we sat down, we spent over an hour there, and all we had to show for it were some chips and salsa and a couple of bad drinks. It was a total mood killer for the two of us who were prepared to party and spend our money at Z'Tejas. Lesson learned!Pretty ghetto. Pretty empty at 2:30am on a Friday night. Pretty sick that girls were barfing in the sinks. Pretty much not going back.Very friendly service but that's about it.  They clearly have no idea what they are doing...from the servers, to the bartenders, to the chefs....it was a debacle from start to finish.  How does prime real estate at one of the nicest casinos in vegas survive such utter incompetence.  They screwed up pretty much everything we ordered..mojitos without muddled mint, overcooked mussels, a souffle left in the oven about 20 min too long, the bussers couldn't figure out how to light the fondue.  Total nincompoopery from start to finish.   

The only thing keeping them from receiving a single star is they were so nice.  But nice only gets you so far.I was a bit disappointed last Thursday night with my visit.  I hadnt been here for 4 years, use to come about 1 time a month late night.  Always quite but the food was a bit pricy for the quality.  I always ordered a steak - not a seafood lover like my ex.  Lately they have had a full lot quite a bit and thought why not try it again.  Really geared for sports and gaming with less expensive food gimics to bring you in.  Not impressed.  Service had gone down and clientle too.  Not anywhere to bring the family.   If you like gambling and sports its the place to go.  Shell fish my friend said is worth the price but not the drive.I used to love Shucks, and it was my go-to neighborhood bar. Back in the day, they had fantastic 2lb crab buckets for under $30. When people would ask me my favorite thing about Las Vegas, those affordable crab buckets would be part of my reply- mostly because you can order them 24 hrs a day. Crab at 3am? Why not?

Those  days are long gone now. The menu has changed, the late night specials have changed, the bar staff has changed. They used to offer a great late night menu after midnight (pics posted) but no more, now it's just breakfast. There's two bartenders who work there late night, one is a darling, the other who is newer is so rude.

The crab is now $9 for 1/2 a pound, which is  just kind of silly. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's only so-so. The tuna is previously frozen, which is what you would expect from a place like this and sometimes it's okay, sometimes it's inedible. The oysters seem to be popular but they're gulf oysters which really isn't my thing.

I used to love this place and would come at least a couple of times a week, but no longer. I'll still drop in once in a while if the bartender I like is working. And it's still a great place to get seafood late at night, but for your bar needs? You can do better.I like the Hotel and the facilities but when it comes to food in general at the Flamingo most food establishment I have tried I was not really impressed with and Flamingo Paradise Buffet is no exception.
Went with my friend around 11 AM wanting to try out this Buffet. 
First of all, this buffet is not really worth the price even thought ours was comped. 
The service was below average.
The Food was not appealing to say the most. The best thing out of this was the Fresh made Omelet, how can you go wrong with that? Everything else was below average.
Greasy Bacon, tough Prime Rib, cold rice and they had Lox , Cream Cheese but no Bagels...lol
Well, at least I tried it and this one is going to the list of my worst Buffet Joining Harrah's buffet. 

This is a no go for me...We frequent Genghis Grill quite a bit and I'm not sure what happened yesterday but our service was AWFUL! First, my bowl was cooked without the sauce I clearly placed next to my bowl.  Then, my boyfriend's bowl came without the rice he ordered. Lastly, our waitress came to check on us once and that was to drop off the wrong drink.  The place wasn't very busy so I was really surprised at the lousy service.Our server at CarneVino was fairly rude. For a group of four we ordered two entrees, 4 appetizers/small plates, a dessert, and a couple glasses of wine  He did not seem to like the fact that we weren't all ordering 3 course meals and that we were sharing everything.  He definitely acted snooty about it.  After he realized that we weren't going to go crazy gorging ourselves on food, we were basically ignored the entire night and had to flag him down if we needed anything.  However, the bus boy, runners, and hostesses were all great.  When we finally got our bill, it stated a suggested gratuity of 20%.  No matter how awesome the service, I don't think that they should put that on the bill, let alone when you get bad service!  It's especially off putting when you're already a generous tipper to begin with.

The food was good, but unfortunately it did not make up for the service, so I would not recommend going to this restaurant.  With all the other options in Vegas, you could definitely get great food with great service elsewhere.I am aware of this place for the past 10 years. I rarely bought stuff here... the displayed cooked dishes looked ordinary.

I went for BBQ pork today. I asked the butcher for one pound of meat. I asked her to pick the lean meat from the stacks.

She made a bad mistake and not shy about it. Even though she has picked a piece already more than 1 lb, she sneaked in another leftover piece and charged me accordingly. Finally tally was 1.33 lbs.

I have seen butchers picked meat to make over the requested weight, but they never added more on purpose.

By the way, the cut of meat is fatty even though I asked for lean meat. I believe all the meats were fat to start with.

So shoppers, this is a dishonest behavior. If it can happen to me, it will happen to you too. Heed my warning. BEWARE!!!!!Disappointing.  The staff is great, the wait staff was very attentive, and the hostes sat us right away.
The food is bland and uninspired.  The chips were great but the "salsa" was chipolte like flavored red sauce.  It tasted strong of smoke with a little heat to it.  The table side guacomole was not very tasty and even though we ordered it with everything included, it didnt seem to help.  The tacos were wrapped in an oily shell and the meat was barely seasoned.  When I ate them the oil from the shell coated my tounge and sapped  flavor from the rest of the dish.  There should have been a acid to combat the oiliness, a fresh salsa would have worked well.
The restaurant had 4 separate familys with kids and two were extremely loud and obnoxious with the parents ignoring their precious offspring so the whole restaurant could endure the piercing screams of the  children.  This is no fault of the restaurant, however I have to ask, when did it become  acceptable to not take the kids outside when they act up?  Why do some people think it's ok to subject others to their poor or nonexistent parenting choices?Eating here was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. The infused sake was good and wallet friendly however it was very weak, not like regular sake, I feel they must have diluted it with juice and not actually used an infusion process. This is not where my disappointment comes from. The service was horrible, and our server made it seem as if we were the problem and she didn't want to be bothered by us. I only got to try one roll because the rest of my food that I ordered, on the same order card, never came. They brought out my one roll on the same plate with one roll from another persons order card, who ordered her food 30 minutes before me. She got her second roll 45 minutes later after asking the waitress about it. Another girl had to wait 30 minutes for her first drink. I have been a waitress before and even if you are extremely busy the server should never make the customer feel like they are are a burden to them. Regardless of what the reason was, the service was terrible and the restaurant should either replace these types of servers or make sure that they have enough staff to handle the volume of customer they get on Saturday nights. I would not pick this as a place to eat.You suck. I ask you if I should order the burger, patty melt or hot dog and you said go with the patty melt.

It was dry, full of onions and lacked taste. 

The only reason you didn't get one star is because at least it was cheap.Food is the only good thing there. And even that's questionable. Check the chicken and make sure it's not pink. Service is a big grump fest. They are so rude and they act like you are bothering them. I guess when they're so busy, who needs to be nice. Be ready to wait at least 30 minutes in line.One of the few fast food chains that offers a veggie burger option. They use the Boca patty which is not my favorite. 

Pros
-Staff is friendly
-Offer a veggie burger, turkey burger
-Skinny Fries (not diet food but they are cut thinner than steak fries)

Cons
-Burgers don't taste that good. My veggie burger was very very lackluster and my friend's beef patty was apparently not a home run either
- Price : 11 dollars for a fast food  meal (burger, fries, coke)
- Not really fast food if it takes 10 min to get the food

It's going to be a long time before I go to FatBurger again. Not impressive but edible.I've had some great steaks in my day but Cut's 20 ounce bone-in Rib Eye did not add to that list.  It had a mostly bland yet slightly salty flavor with no marbling whatsoever.  This was the healthiest Rib Eye steak I've ever seen or eaten which was not my goal here.  I also watched as other steaks were served around the room and I never said "wow that's what I should have ordered".  Guess I've been spoiled by too many great places where the sizzle and smell of fantastic steaks going by tease all your senses.  

There is only one reason I can think of do Cut.  If you want to impress a client or customer this is the right kind of place - it's exotic with enough varieties of aged steak for anyone to have a "new" dining experience. In hindsight I should have tried one of those cuts.  Everything here is expensive - I'm sure most of Cut's customers are putting this meal on their expense reports.  You will spend anywhere from $100 to $150 per person.  

Just today I read other reviews here and saw the ladies group that was insulted with the question of whether they had a "money issue" because they wanted to share a variety of entries.  This did not surprise me.  The all male wait staff has an aire of arrogance about them - these guys really take themselves way too seriously.  It must come down from top management because they all appear cloned.  Maybe this is a style that appeals to most high end customers.  Personally I prefer a waiter that could be more friendly and informal.  But I've seen these same bionic waiters at other expensive places so it must be considered proper.

Regarding atmosphere Cut has a cold contemporary feel.  Again I suppose many other high end customers might like this motif.  Personally I'll take a place with cushy chairs and oak panels or brass rails or even red drapes, napkins and tablecloths!  The hard feel of glass and plastic doesn't put me at ease to rest comfortably and enjoy.  Probably the idea is to keep folks from lingering too long.       

With so many great steak houses in Vegas I won't ever be going back here.  I've read many of the positive CUT reviews here on Yelp and it makes me think these people have never experienced a really outstanding steak dinner.  Too bad for them!The best I can say about Two Hippies is that it's cheap, and the founders are good marketers. Unfortunately, the dining room is small and uninviting, and the food is just okay. I won't be returning.So I was debating on writing a review or not to this place because it use to be my favorite place to hang out every Thursday night for over a year with my boyfriend. We had great service from Matt, Darrin, Buddy, Justin, Ray and all the other guys who USE TO work there. They went above and beyond to make sure they served everyone and the drinks and food were great. Things started changing mainly with the staff and the changes were not good. All those guys we would return to see, were no longer there. The feel of the place was not the same and also the service with the new people was horrible. I have not returned to this place in about 3 months because it just was not the same. Not just the service, but the food. There are changes and I do not like the new "Nachos" those are not nachos! Anyways, I read some of these reviews down there and it seems that the place is not improving and it makes me feel like that I have no business going back. I just hope that the owners realize that their changes has affected business and it is really upsetting.I wish I could give Mido a higher review. I used to like coming here; it has a GREAT value; happy hour all day on weekdays; free miso soup, salad, and edamame with your meal; pretty decent sushi, like the Pancho Roll; and really friendly chefs. I used to really enjoy Mido as a family restaurant with a nice atmosphere.

So I took some friends with me the other day when I took a trip down there. Some of friends were guys who love sushi and can eat a LOT, so they got the 20$ all-you-can-eat special (which is a really good deal). It was a disappointing experience. The sushi was very sloppily prepared and the quality of taste was none too great either. This would have been excusable, because for 20$ all you can eat, you can't really expect 5 star sushi every time. However, our biggest complaint was with the service.

There's a waitress there, an older Asian woman, who was very abrupt and brusque. Some of our friends arrived a few minutes later then the rest of us, and she took a long time coming back to our table, even though the restaurant was empty. So the rest of us had our appetizers, edamame, soup, and drinks; she came back a few times to see if we were ready to order our sushi but paid no attention to the newcomers who were lacking in drinks or any of the other stuff. Finally, when we were giving her our sushi orders, I politely pointed out that our friends hadn't gotten their drinks yet. She replied rudely, "Yeah, I know, I already know that," and just walked off.

Okay, not too big of a deal. So she brings us our stuff and my friends order their first round of all-you-can-eat-sushi. They finish it off and we're given the same ticket that we marked our orders on the first time. My friends thought this would be confusing, so when they were writing down their second orders (on the same ticket that still had our first), they put darkened circles next to the second orders. The waitress took the ticket without looking at it or pausing to confirm and just whisked off.

Lo and behold, the order she brought back was the exact same rolls they had ordered the first time, not the ones they wanted to try for their second round. When we told her what had happened, she responded with extreme impatience and annoyance, pretty much just blaming us. Our friends didn't really want to eat the same rolls they had just had, so they asked her what they should do, because they were also hesitant to waste it. She said that we should just eat what we had ordered, so they were forced to eat the exact same rolls a second time.

So then they ordered a third time, because there were still rolls they wanted to try and they had paid for all you can eat. When they told our waitress that they were ready to order a third round, she acted as if we were being absurd for wanting more. She was even ruder and more abrupt and snatched the ticket out of our hands. The more sushi we ordered, the more irritated she seemed to get. Are we not supposed to order all you can eat for the all you can eat deal?...

Anyway, it was just a really unpleasant experience because of the service. The sushi was just okay, 3 stars at best, but there is a good variety of rolls at Mido that we unfortunately felt unable to try because it was like we were being persecuted for wanting to order more. Every "round" of ordering was only three or four rolls, two per person, so it wasn't like we were just marking up every roll on the list and stuffing our faces and eating the restaurant out of house and home. We never want to go back here, which makes me sad, because I used to really love Mido.OVERALL RATING:
Service: 3
Decor: 2
Food: 2
Dog-friendly: Yes
--------------------------------------------------
Plus (+):
Well priced and a lot of outdoor seating.

Minus (-):
Although the toppings are fun, they're not very good. The chocolate chips should've been a lot better. I don't think there was a whole lot of thought behind the quality of toppings they provide. The toppings bar was not well stocked, and considering the amount of customers in the place, the toppings bar was way too small and we had to wait in line to get our toppings.  A huge pet peeve of mine is wastefulness. They use one size of Styrofoam container (it's pretty big) and no matter how little you want, you have to use the XL container. Somewhere a piece of land is getting filled with this stuff:( 
--------------------------------------------------
This fro-yo is OK. I think this place us more for kids though. I don't think I'll go back unless someone drags me...Oh Sushisamba. I am having a real hard time with this review. 

First of all we made a reservation and were swiftly escorted to our table. The restaurant was dead yet we were packed into one area, on top of the other dozen couples in the restaurant. I HATE when places do that. We were literally elbow to elbow with strangers in an empty restaurant - UGH.

Second, since we were so close to everyone else we observed first hand what awesome service they were getting. It was too bad our waiter was different (his name was Kiley I believe) and he SUCKED. Disappeared for long periods of time, took forever to take our order and bring drinks, didn't ever say when he'd be back around, didn't check on us, didn't apologize, took forever with the check. Really bad service made worse by the excellent service everyone else around us seemed to be getting.

Third, the only redeeming thing about this place was the food. It was excellent. However, it was overpriced and the portions were really small. Normally I could overlook bad service and a weird atmosphere if the food is great but not with this place. I can say for certain that I will not be back here - especially in Vegas where good food and good service are the gold standard. Sushisamba isn't worth a second chance.Our dd took a few classes like Apples to zebras & Bldg Blk over the past few months. It has been a great experience not until lately. She came home complained about one of the boy bullying her - physically punching her. It wasn't once and twice, it was in several occasions.

We went to alert one of the main 'instructor' - she said it has never happened before?!  While our dd was literally crying when we told the instructor because she was so scared that after letting them know, that boy will 'beat her up' even worse.

In various occasions, we went to picked her up and we noticed that the younger instructors were standing around, chit chatting and not paying attention to the kids. It was a BIG class, 16-18 kids in a room with maybe 4 or so instructors (whenever they can get them in)

Mind you, they are only "instructors" because they are staff for the City of Chandler, NOT 'qualified pre-school trained' teachers having any kind of certification - at least not ALL of them. We learnt that one of the staff working there was asked to stand-in once in awhile when they are understaffed. That's why their fees are really affordable.

We coached our daughter as we understand that we as parents need to take responsibility in coaching her how to deal with such bullies, however, we also need to alert anyone out there who still want to send their kids in to be aware that the instructors need to be better trained in this aspect.I've shopped at this location several times now and at first I had a great experience and thought the staff was friendly and helpful. I now have mixed feelings about the place. The salespeople are still helpful but apparently not to everyone. My wife, who is not athletic, is mostly ignored by the staff whenever she shops there for gifts. When I went there today to try on shoes I researched online, the guy that helped me barely answered any questions and was so uninterested in the sale he only looked me in the eye once or twice. It's not that he was in a hurry or anything, because the store was barely occupied and I had already waited through their 15 minute queue. I noticed that he was fully engaging with other shoppers on my way out, though. I would like to give them a better rating because they do know their stuff, but in my experience if you don't look like an athlete the level of service you get will be hit or miss. If I shop there again it will be online purchases when they have better deals than Amazon.Bar North left me with a bad taste in my mouth and I don't think it was entirely due to the chlorine flavored water or lemon infused cannoli.  For a bar in North Scottsdale, I was expecting more.

When you walk in, Bar North has a good sophisticated feel to it and I really liked the open air feel.    We initially started out sitting at the bar while we hawked a table outside to open up. Personally I think the drink choices are incredibly lacking for a place with the word "Bar" in its name. There were only 5 or 6 beer choices and the wine list was pretty meager as well.  A person next to us asked if they had Red Bull and they didn't...again as a "bar" even an upscale one at that, I was a bit surprised they didn't have Red Bull.   The two desserts that our group tried during the evening weren't very good at all...the cannolis were disgusting, but thankfully were only $4. The hazelnut cake did not get good reviews either from those in our group that tried it.

I could have gotten over a lackluster drink selection and disappointing desserts if the service had been awesome.  However, service, to be frank, sucks.  The girl behind the bar was awful (not friendly at all...it seemed like we were inconveniencing her) and when I tried to close our tab because we were moving outside, it took forever to finally get someone's attention.  Once we moved outside and had a waiter, it didn't get better.  He clearly walked by a few times and never asked how we were doing and if we wanted/needed more drinks. Once we got the bill, he never came and picked it up, so Kristin S. had to take it inside to the bar to pay.

To top the whole night off, the outside of Bar North faces the fountains. So we were treated to children screaming and running through the fountains at 10 pm. Later we saw one child sitting at a table in Bar North eating dessert...at like 10:30 pm. Awesome.For all the times I've been to Vegas, Wet Republic was my first pool party.  A gf and I meandered over pretty early - around noon - and there was no line, no cover.  We brought only our phones, id, and some cash since we knew how strict it was. 

....We were nagged by security quite a bit (don't sit in front of the reserved area, make sure your towel fits the line of the outer ledge..) and didn't drink anything since it seemed like a pretty good waste of money. It was fun watching people prance around in all their naked splendour, but we left in about an hour.

I just felt so hemmed in by all the restrictions though! I understand, but it was just a lot of work and feeling like a criminal to just dip in your feet!Weird vibe here. The drinks were overly priced (e.g., $27 for a Grey Goose & Cran), but strong. The seahorses are cute, but not like a main draw. There are so many other amazing places to grab drinks that have much better atmospheres...why stop here?This place is your classic old school diner, complete with huge American-sized  XL portions, "you doin' OK honey?" service, and floral wallpaper. 

I'm a food snob from the Bay Area, so I expect to be eating vegan waffles with homemade whipped cream or bacon infused beignets for breakfast. 

But if you're a normal person and you want to have a nice breakfast after church with the family, this place will be perfect for you.I would expect more from a hotel mogul such as the Donald. With such amazing restaurants in Las Vegas I don't know why anyone would eat here, aside from convenience. My coworkers and I were beat after working a trade show floor and convenience won. 

I made reservations for three on a Sunday night for 6:30. I understand that this is not the prime time for dining in Vegas but this joint was Dead with capital D; no reservations would have been needed. 

The menu had some tantalizing choices, among them a $29 prix fixe which my two coworkers went for and seemed to be pleased with. I on the other hand, was seriously disappointed. I ordered the caesar salad--just fine, nothing amazing, and the pasta which was a carbonara cream sauce with cured meat. My pasta was so salty it was inedible. I understand that this type of pasta is going to be salty but this made my blood pressure skyrocket and my hands swell so much my rings started to cut off my circulation--after only six bites (I tried!). Absolutely disgusting, and I LOVE salt; I couldn't eat it. 

Our server (if you can call him that--another bus-person/server brought all of the food/drinks out and cleared all of the plates) kindly removed the offending dish from the bill but only after trying to patronize me by saying the dish is salty by nature (duh, dude but you taste it and tell me it is supposed to taste like a salt lick). 

Overall, I was totally unimpressed. An empty room, unenthused staff and inedible food=big fat NO. Go somewhere else.Burger was just OK, service was good, salad & dressing were nasty! Way too expensive for average food. I'd rather get a bistro salad at Trader Joe's for $4!Dolce has been my go-to place for spa services since I relocated to Scottsdale. However, this soon may change. 

The first time I visited the Borgata location I was taken aback by the stylish decor of the two story spot equipped with a hair salon, nail salon, makeup boutique, and a variety of unique purses, jewelry, clothes, gifts, etc. The front desk staff was incredibly kind and helpful, immediately checking me in and showing me to the locker room to change, and then to the Relaxation Room to wait for my services to begin. They even bought me lunch from Blanco once they realized I was going to be there for a full day. After a 1 hour Organic Facial, 2 hour Swedish Massage with Aromatherapy and Hot Stones, Spa Pedicure and Manicure, Shampoo/Conditioned Hairstyle, and full Makeup application I left feeling like a total Bitchin' Rockstar, ready to ravage the clubs in OldTown to celebrate my birthday.

Since then, I have been in multiple times for different services: massages, mani/pedis, spray tanning. Each of those occasions I noticed that the quality of services stayed exceptional, while the customer service was not as great. Today, I had the worst experience with Dolce at the Borgata and I am considering not going back.

After waiting for 30 minutes on hold, I finally scheduled my 90 min. Organic Facial and a 2 hour Swedish Massage. I was told to arrive early at 10:15 to check in and relax in the Relaxation Room, and my facial would start at 10:30. When asked if I wanted a complementary shampoo blowout and makeup touch up, I happily accepted and eagerly anticipated my long overdue day of pampering. When I arrived at 10:15, I was not greeted with a smile, a hello, a head nod, or a "i'll be with you in a moment". Instead the Client Coordinators were chatting among themselves with their backs turned toward the door, and as a client I was the one who had to get their attention. After one of the girls checked me in, she told me to take a seat and someone would be with me shortly, then continued to chat with her coworkers. After wandering around the store looking at hair products, makeup, skin care, and accessories I checked my phone and it was 10:35! Irritated, I interrupted the Client Coordinators' discussion notifying them that my appointment was supposed to start at 10:30, and asked if I could at least go back into the locker room to change. 

Finally, my esthetician Jordyn found me and brought me to back for my facial. Amazingly, she was courteous and friendly!!! A welcomed change from the other staff. Her analysis of my skin and choice of products was right on point, and along with a High Frequency breakout treatment and Eye treatment, I left the room with my face feeling like it was kissed by angels! 

Next, my 2 hour Swedish Massage with Josh. Best masseuse I have found so far!!!! After reviewing my target areas, he started with a Fiji Coconut Oil Scalp Massage, and continued with my requested blend of Peppermint/Eucalyptus Aromatherapy, Spot Deep Tissue treatment, and Hot Stones. Needless to say I left the session floating on Cloud 12, leaving all the stress and tension from my neck and shoulders, as well as pain in my lower back, in the room behind me. 

On to my complementary shampoo styling with Elise, who did a fantastic job maintaining friendly and interesting conversation, and following through with my request for a voluminous blowout. Too bad I can't say the same about my complementary makeup touch-up with  Jewel. As a touch-up, I didn't expect much, but the mineral powder applied was at least 2 or 3 shades darker than my skin tone. Topped off with a dark bronzer and a maroon lipstick/gloss that reminded me of something my grandmother (god rest her soul) would have worn!!! Needless to say, when I returned to the locker room to change, I immediately had to do my own touch-up to the touch-up just so I wouldn't be humiliated while checking out and walking to my car.

When checking out, I presented Client Coordinator Rachel with a Groupon worth $80 of services, along with the Fall Menu with Special prices listed, a hair styling product I wanted to purchase, and my Dolce Discount Bag. It took Rachel at least 15 minutes to calculate how much I needed to pay after looking at the regular menu and Fall menu multiple times. After returning back home, I looked at my receipt and realized that Rachel had only given me a $40 discount for my Groupon. I paid $40 dummy...it wouldn't be a Groupon if I only received $40 worth of services!!! I had to then return to the Spa to ask her for an explanation and for a refund for being overcharged.

It's sad that the Dolce brand is being jeopardized by Client Coordinator staff members who have no concept of customer service, or basic math skills for that matter, even though the facial, hair, massage, and nail professionals always meet or exceed my expectations. I sincerely hope management takes action ASAP!!!!Service was ok, but the food isn't anything close to the quality of sushi I am used to in California. Can't expect much in the desert I guess. The fish has a fishy taste suggesting it's not super freshIf you like Chipotle's, you will like this place, as they are identical. This is a "fresh and healthy" type restaurant. I went for lunch with my wife. Basically, you pick the item you want, I had steak tacos, and then you add the toppings you want, all for one price. 
   After spooning my "marinated, then grilled" steak into the tortillas from the hot line, I was rushed over to the cold line for additional toppings, bypassing beans, rice, etc. I had the lady go back to  the hot line to get the toppings I wanted then back to the cold line. I felt that I was being rushed through the line even though no one was behind me! I managed to find the only salt shaker in the place, and had to use Cholula hot sauce to have any flavor on the food. Very bland food, can't call this a Mexican restaurant in any way. Bland food, rushed through the line, not a good exp.
   The only good things are guac was good, restrooms were clean, quantity of food was decent for the price.Pros: Tons of vegan options and baked-goods that are yummy.

Cons: SUPER SLOW SERVICE, 2/3 people complain of a stomach ache after eating here.

Today when my BF and I dined at RVC we waited about twenty minutes for an order of fire-fries and a panini with fries. I saw the kitchen staff didn't fire my panini until the fires were finished and waiting on our plates to be served, getting cold. When the food did arrive my panini was barley grilled and cheese not melted entirely or throughly, and the panini didn't have all the fixings described on the menu.

This is third time in a row I've dined at RVC and received super slow service, making today's experience not a fluke. 

Additionally, my tummy starts hurting immediately after I finish my meal. I am a vegan who eats very clean, mainly plant based foods and whole grains. Possibly my tummy hurts because I'm not use to eating products like vegan meats and cheeses? But my BFF also complains of upset stomach after a RVC experience and will not go back. 

My boyfriend who is not vegan will not return to the restaurant unless it's my last resort as he thinks as a non-vegan the food is nothing to write home about and the service is frustrating.I dig cafes and had a BOGO so decided to check this place out on my lunch hour. The food was decent, but then I was sick for two days after. I won't return!i live very closes by dannys so when i need an oil change i usually go there because you get a free wash. well, not anymore. my gf was flying in to PHX and i had about 45 mins to kill until she landed. i decided to get my oil changed. i asked the guys how long, both of them said 20mins, 30 mins at the longest with the wash. i said okay, well 1 hour later, and a gf who had already landed i finally said "listen, i need my car now". they said its almost done, we still need to wash it though. i told them no, just give it to me. they gave me a slip for a future wash, which is fine, but the problem is they tell you 20 mins it should be 20mins, 30 at most. next time, i'll drop it off at the mechanic or go to jiffy lube. 

oh, and i forgot to mention the sales guys. my god. i told the car wash rep i needed an oil change, he asked me about 12 times to upgrade for $3 or $6. literally 12 times, are you kidding me? that is bordering on harassment. its bad enough and i'm a guy, my poor gf is really offended by the constant badgering. then the oil change kid, he asks if i want to upgrade to today's special of synthetic oil for $62.99. wtf? first off, the price is scribbled in pen directly on his clipboard. obviously, it is the that same damn special everyday so just our everyday special. also, how dumb is this kid that he can't remember the prices. 

dannys really needs to get their act together. go back to basics. train these sales people better. its fine if you want to offer me once to upgrade, maybe twice, but that is it. i will give credit to dannys for the design of the lobby and the aesthetics. but all the great goes to crap when you have terrible customer service.We came here on a Friday night around 7pm and the place was pretty packed. Ordered 4 rolls and it took around 35 minutes to get the first roll. While we were waiting we noticed how almost every table around us had at least one dish delivered that was the wrong thing and had to be sent back. We ended up having an extra roll brought to our table by mistake as well. The food was really good, but the service was bad enough to not make us want to come back. Super slow, all what appeared to be high schoolers with no direction. It appeared that they were incredibly overstaffed as well, but no one seemed to know what tables ordered what and there was really no organization. If you happen to go at a time that isn't busy it might be worth it, but going when there's a crowd is not worth the time.Super sad that there is no bakery or roasted duck inside this Ranch 99 location. :( Everything here is WAY overpriced and nothing is sold in bulk here.Food here was delicious, i would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the service. Yes, service was that bad. And I believe Matt our server was the owner or manager. All of our table got the feeling that we were bothering him somehow, it wasn't even busy. He would run away as soon as he dropped off our drinks before we could even ask for cream for coffee, I stared at him for 20 minutes trying to get his attention before I retired and asked another server who looked much busier than him. Same story with our food, he HANDED us our food to pass around to whoever it belonged to and ran away as soon as his hands were free- wait ranch! Everything look ok? Nope, he was gone. And didn't return until he brought the check, joy. No eye contact, smile, or thanks for coming in. We will not be returning.What a huge disappointment - from the bland, expensive burger to the un-pickle that accompanied it.

For $12 (base burger price) plus $1 (cheese) plus $1.50 (bbq onions), I got a $14.50 letdown.  

Save your dollars and go to Margaritaville for a wonderful cheeseburger in paradise (with a delicious pickle to boot) for a much better price.  It's right across the street.  Plus, you don't have to deal with the pretension.  Bonus.Milkshakes were very good.. I had the all-nighter, and my girlfriend had the mocha mudslide . Both were expensive, but a good size.. A little bigger would have been nice for the price. 

The burgers were not good. We had a party of three and all three burgers were just not good. I had the special brisket burger, it was super dry and had no taste. I had to ask for cup of BBQ sauce because it was bone dry (asked for medium). Others in my party had the Mexican burger and just a plain hamburger and both claimed that they were nothing special. Burgers don't come with fries, you have to pay extra which is unheard of these days. Combo options are not a good idea as you are limited to three very boring burgers.

Our waitress was attentive and checked on us multiple times during the meal. Overall this place wasn't cooked up to be the great burger place it makes itself out to be. I wouldn't return, and advise if you are specifically looking for a good burger to go elsewhere.This place sits literally in the doorway of the side entrance of the Mirage casino and is really just your average mediocre burger joint. Ordered some food here when I was drinking across the way at the Rhumbar which allows you to bring food in while you are drinking. The menu is a collection of forgetful selections and drinks and shakes etc. Typical greasy bar food and average burgers. The appetizers include baja tacos and fried dill pickles. Opted to order some of those and it was just okay. Nothing to write home about with steep prices and a place to skip to go 200 feet to the Carnegie Deli down the hall.Worst Dunkin Donuts I have ever been to. Little variety to choose from. Employees seem to really hate working there. They were not unfriendly, but they were not happy to be at work in that location. I have been going to this location for several years, and have noticed it going down hill for a while.  The lack of selection is propbably the worst thing about this location. A donut is acutally supposed to have donuts right? If you are looking for a plain cake donut or a cake donut with some frosting and sprinkles on it then this place is ok.  Just a lot of ho hum blah at this location. Not bad enough to warrent only one star, but not good enough to go back anymore. Bottom line: The pastry selection at the average Las Vegas grocery store is equal to or better than the selection at this Dunkin Donuts location.Cockroach crawled out of sprout plate... Killed it, hesitated to stay but did. They apologized, replaced food, charged me every cent for my food n to-go dinner. Used to come here every week, my fav pho diner, but I think I'll drive a little farther to Chinatown from now on...I went here a year ago, and from what I remember, the line was super long to get in. Luckily I got the "free passes" for the ladies earlier in the day, but the line with guys and girls was so long, all the girls had to go to the separate line in order to take advantage of the free pass. 

Inside the club, the dance floor we went to was immediately closed off cuz some drunk chick threw up all over the bar and herself. Yeah, in the beginning of the night.

What made this club a 2 is the fact that I've been to a number of Vegas clubs, and this club had the MOST CREEPS. There were people in there dressed really casual, and I distinctly remember one creep with a baseball shirt and jeans feelin up on one of my drunk friends. Don't get me wrong... I had fun, and I think most of my friends had fun because we were all pretty tipsy, but the atmosphere (the creeps) and the drunk girl in the beginning ruined my experience here.What's there to say... it's just another mall, and actually, because of the layout, it's pretty annoying. C'mon Canada, build some two story malls for a change!

Fairview Park Mall includes a:

Sears- Yeah, who actually shops here anymore? Really.
The Bay- It's like a wannabe Macy's, but even Macy's isn't that great. 
Roots- Much like American Eagle... it's very passe.
Aldo- After you wear an aldo shoe for a month it'll looked like you've loved it for years!
Tim Hortons- Of course there's a TM here. There's one everywhere... You know what, I'll actually raise the rating of the mall by one star if they remove it. The popularity of TH really makes it look like Canadians have no taste buds.

Anyway,

The list goes on...

There's nothing here, kids. Check out St. Jacobs Farmers Market if you want to see something interesting.When I say DISAP you say POINTED. Disappointed!  Disappointed!  I really hate writing this review because in the past we have had such great experiences at EDO and this review is not about the food because the Sushi and Hibachi are good food.  But the service...WHOA!

Picture it...Valentines Day and my wife and almost 2 year old want a nice dinner.   We debated many nice places but with the child they can be difficult at times so we decided some Sushi and Hibachi is nice, quick and delicious.  So we plan a early arrival at a place we have been to before...EDO!  When we arrive the place is almost empty and we get one of the private dining rooms.

Sushi Rolls are ordered as an appetizer. Dumplings and chicken fried rice are ordered are ordered for our daughter to come out with the appetizers.  And a Hibachi meal to split for my wife and I as an entree. And....we wait.

After 50 minutes still no food.  Ok, starting to get annoyed.  1 hour and 15 minutes of waiting and here come our sush....nope.  it is our Hibachi entree.  WTF?  Really?  I was explained by the waitress that they had an influx of orders and were really behind.  Hmmmm, ok...so I decided to scope out the scene because they obviously had many patrons arrive after we did.  Not so much, because the place had maybe 2 people at the Hibachi table, 2 people at the sushi bar, and about 5 other tables full.  In other words the place was dead.

About 10 minutes after our entree arrived our daughters food arrived and the chicken friend rice was bland and the dumplings were still cold. 

1.5 hours after our arrive we finally got 2 of our 3 sushi rolls and the third about 10 minutes after that.  We enjoyed the first 2 rolls and got the third to go as we were obviously over the experience and not even our daughter who was starving liked her food (she ate what she probably really wanted after we left, McDonalds).

I have a hard time understanding a couple things here.  1)  How does it take 1.5 hours for sushi when the place is dead.  2) Why would you bring our entree our before our appetizer when we clearly wanted the sushi first?  3) When we placed the kids order and said bring that ASAP....does that mean an hour of so later?  

Do not get me wrong.  Besides the chicken fried rice and the frozen dumplings the hibachi and sushi were great but holy lord the service was about as fun as watching Alabama win a National Football Championship (and for an Auburn fan that is not fun).

Sorry EDO, I love your food and maybe you can make it up to me in the future but the service last night was pure crap and a major turn off.  What happened EDO?   What happened?  DISAP...

Oh yeah, oh, the steamed rice and little sauces that normally accompany the hibachi never arrived and when we asked the waitress she knew nothing about them.This place is in my neighborhood and I decided to support a local business instead of going to a chain like Little Caesar's or something. The pizza was mediocre and the price was high. Perfect. The veggies on my pizza were basically raw and the sauce did not taste good.Not sure how to rate since this is Las Vegas but if I visited this place near me it would be 2 stars.

My meal only cost around $9.00 and could feed two people. I didn't have the time to go elsewhere since I was at a convention at the Rio 

I got what I thought was three broccoli stems with two shiktakki mushroom caps and a few shreds of carrot with a (Maybe) fried slightly crispy block of tofu with slightly hard rice on the side but after eating more I discovered this might be Chinese broccoli because of the ONE leaf I discovered.

The sauce was mild and flavorless and the steamed white rice was hard and crunchy.

The Chinese broccoli steams were very hard to cut with the plastic forks they give you here and the sauce was too mild to enjoy. 

But for a Casino this was extremely low priced and maybe better to some people. It was low priced but would go elsewhere If we had the time. It will do in a pinch.Well I live down the street from this place. And I hate coming to it. First reason; drink specials. Or may I say the lack there of. For women they have some pretty good specials but for us men I think this place figures since all the servers are in school girl outfits they are doing us a favor. Honestly I careless about the servers and what they wear. It's no strip club. I come there for one reason only, a beer. And when it's over priced it's not worth it. The food at this joint is also crappy, only the french fries are ok. I recommend going to Salty Senoritas if your looking for a good bar  & food and atmosphere right down the street.I have been here 2 times, the first time it took the waitress/bartender around 10 mins to greet us. They were not busy at all. The 2nd time my friends and I showed up sat at 11am and we were one of the first ones in there. Once again the service was really bad and it took over 45 mins for our lunch to come out! She said the kitchen kept messing up my friends meal that's what took so long so she comped his meal but not ours???we had to wait to!!!overall the food is okay the service is bad!Blaah.
Ate here in a party of five because we were staying at the hotel and it was convenient.   By Las Vegas standards, $22 for a buffet is not expensive but by my standards I do expect some good food at that price.  The LVH Buffet failed to deliver.
Basically, nothing was terrible but nothing was like "Wow, I gotta get me some more of that!"  Everyone else in my party felt the same.  I had the salmon (dry and tough), chicken Marsala (flavorless).  The turkey was ok, as was the beef and the sausage.  I could find no fault with the shrimp cocktail.  The salad bar was uninspiring and blah - at least have some pepperoni.  
There was unlimited beer and wine -- cheap beer (Hamms) and wine.  Good to get drunk on but alas I had to drive to the airport later that evening, otherwise I would have  tried to drink my money's worth.
The best part of the meal was the soft-serve chocolate ice cream.
We went on a Sunday night and some of the things mentioned in other reviews were not there, namely Mexican food and sushi.  I like both.  My dining experience definitely suffered in their absence.
Service was good.
In the end I regretted being lazy and settling for the convenience of this buffet.  I would have rather have put the $120 I spent towards a better quality buffet at another hotel or gone to a restaurant off the strip and had a cheaper and better meal.After hearing nothing but rave reviews of America's Taco Shop, it was time to give it a try.
I ordered their "best Carne Asada in town" tacos. And I beg to differ. There are plenty of places I have had better Carne Asada. I'm going to blaspheme according to some, but I've had better Carne Asada at Chipotle, for meat's sake. I thought the meat was overcooked. I have yet to find somewhere that comes close to Comedor Guadalajara for Carne Asada. The side of beans was ok. 
The staff was courteous and friendly, the service was great.
But, I really don't see what the big deal is about America's Taco Shop. After all the hype, I expected it to be great. But it was good, at best.
With a menu as limited as America's Taco Shop has, they should excel at what little they do offer and that's just not the case.This place is not good for vegetarians and don't really seem to want to work with you to make anything a healthy vegetarian option that's also tasty.  Beware! Most of their noodle dishes have fish sauce, chicken stock or the like. The server seemed annoyed that I even asked, and also said it wouldn't be possible to have a veggie protein in a salad. Their seitan was one note: salty. Better to try seasons 52 next door, which at least has some flavorful vegetarian options.I came here for lunch with my hubby. Thought we give this place a try. My hubby had the lunch special. Salad was like four pieces of lettuce, tomato, and dressing. The curry, I can make at home and taste better. Seemed too watery. I had pad Thai, had better. Nothing special. The service was okay. 

Honestly, better Thai joints around the area. I've been here once, won't go back again.We stayed in a hotel around the corner from the restaurant and when staying in London I would often go to the Garfunkels off Trafalgar Square, so thought I would go there and enjoy an English, um Scottish, breakfast.

We were sat quickly and I ordered the bottomless coffee and a typical breakfast of eggs, sausage, bacon, etc.  The coffee came after 5 minutes but waited about a half hour for the food altough the place was far from crowded, it was morning and everybody was pretty much ordering the same breakfast, so I didn't expect to have to wait so long.

I finished my first of the bottomless cups of coffee in about 10 minutes.  Unlike in the USA where the waitresses come by with a pot of coffee and say, "can I warm that up for you," these Polish waitresses were nowhere in sight.  I had to go and grab one to get another cuppa joe!  I did in fact see the bottom of my cup, so the bottomless thing is a flat out lie!  I hate when they lie about coffee!!

The food came... eventually.  It was ok but nothing to write a postcard home about.  

So dear readers and travelers to far away exotic places like Garfunkels around the world; if you are close to a Garfunkels and it is the only place open, do grab some greasy breakfast but insist that they stand by to recharge your coffee cup as often as you deem necessary.Ah, bless. This place hasn't had a review since 2010 - neglected much? I was in attendance to enjoy/mark a student event and they did a very good job. The venue itself was remarkably well suited to a ceilidh: wooden dance floor (still bouncy, 16 years after my only other visit), an area for the band and so on. They've got a smart chandelier too. It's still The Cav though, so pretty grim even on this more sedate showing - it turned out that the stickiness of the ledge I was leaning on wasn't down to sticky drink spillages, but rather some black paint that was quietly drying away to itself.Saturday morning after a long and enduring night of partying, they wanted some filipino breakfast.

It was around 11, and we assumed that they would have a full arsenal of breakfast food since, well, vegas doesn't wake up until then anyway.

They had the lunch items out, absent any common breakfast items like fried eggs, garlic rice etc. They did have langonisa and tocino though. 

We got a combo which had lechon kawali, (yeah for breakfast, I know) and langonisa, and regular rice. The portioning was small, and for a pricey fee of $8.00 

The only aspect of the meal I thoroughly enjoyed was the langonisa (am I spelling this correctly), everything else was just ok.This will be wordy, so summary is - hostesses aren't so great, love the decor, super loud restaurant, perfect burger is good but not perfect, adult creamsicle milkshake rocks, service is friendly but a little disorganized, would I go back - probably not.

We showed up at LBS to grab dinner before the weezer show at red rock's pool. Arrived at 7 and were told it would be an hour wait for a party of 6. I recommend making a reservation even though its just a burger joint. They seem to just seat people at whatever table happens to be open. There was a party of 4 at a table for 6, party of 3 at one of the big booths, etc.

We finally heard our name called, then the hostess said give me a few minutes to get the table ready, so it was over 5 min waiting more. I found that really odd - to me, you shouldn't call for a table unless you're ready to seat them. 

I let the server know we were in a hurry, she said it's about 20 min for the kitchen to get orders out. So ok, I got the adult creamsicle milkshake $8.50 and the "perfect burger" - burger with bacon, gruyere, frisee, roasted tomato, onion marmalade, herb mayo and their LBS sauce $13.75

Milkshake took about 15 min to come out even though the bar didn't look that hectic, but it was worth the wait - tastes just like a creamsicle you hardly taste the alcohol. Burger came out 5 min later and although I wouldn't call it perfect, it was a damn good burger. Burger was juicy and cooked perfectly medium, bacon was pretty thick but the texture was wrong - rather hard and chewy, not crispy like bacon should be. The marmalade, LBS sauce and mayo overwhelmed the flavor of the burger itself, too many condiments also made it messy to eat. 

Onion rings and shoestring fries were average - onion ring was crispy but the inside was mushy like it was overcooked. Texture was almost like burger king's rings. Potato twister was good, but I was kind of surprised they were just potato chips. I assumed twister meant curly fries, but whatever. They were fresh potato chips, the twister aspect is to me a negative because anytime you went to pick up one chip, you had to break it off of a big cluster of chips. I did the check in offer for the free potato twister and the server brought us 2 orders since I didn't know someone else had ordered one too. Weird that she just assumed we wanted 2 instead of asking - it was way too much so we barely touched the 2nd order. 

The decor was cool and fun - I'm in love with the black lace windows. Cool light fixtures, an American flag made up of painted license plates on the ceiling. I don't know if the acoustics are funky, but that was easily the loudest restaurant I've ever been to. Its a smallish room but there was no obnoxiously loud table, just regular dinner conversation. I've never been to a restaurant where I had to nearly shout to someone only 1 person away from me. There was just a constant annoying buzz of the conversations going on at other tables, I kind of just gave on talking to anyone besides the people directly next and across from me.This is hard to review.  The reason being is that I knew it was a tourist trap and it was just a huge gimmick.  That being said, I knew what to expect.

Let me explain prices and such.  You pay $25.  To get in and for a drink voucher.  You go in and it's a pretty tiny refridgerator.  With ice benches and such.  THE NAKED STATUE IS GONE!  NO TITTY SUCKING PREVS!  (OK, we wanted to do that too...)

This place is huge on taking your money.  No cameras allowed like the others have mentioned.  Their excuse is that electronics go bad under that weather.  Not true.  A photographer comes in to take pictures, with a regular camera.  You can buy pics for about $20 each after.

It's not too cold to be honest.  So don't worry about getting extra coats or wahtever, save your money.  You're paying enough to walk into a fridge.

It was cool to go to though.  Once in a lifetime thing.Hm... most items in La Senza just look naff and cheap and the whole place nearly went tits up (pardon the pun) a few years ago and I'm surprised it's still open for business. 

I found it hilarious as after visiting a few Euro shops in Berlin and Dresden most of their underwear was from La Senza. Are things that bad La Senza that you have to flog off your poorly made garments for one euro? Apparently so.

I have to admit, they do offer some cosy jammies and I got a nice tartan teddy pair in the January sales but apart from the jammies the underwear is pretty rubbish. Most of the undies are in garish colours, like bright pink or luminous orange so if you want your knickers to glow in the dark then there's a good range here. In addition to bad pants, every bra I've ever bought from here is always too small even when I buy my usual size that does the job everywhere else.

I dunno... La Senza used to be nice and I used to enjoy buying friends nice gifts wrapped in pretty boxes with scented beads inside. The La Senza fad is definitely done and dusted, or perhaps I've just grown out of it.Not a sushi fan so I ordered the stir-fry. And they asked me if I wanted a side of rice with it. You read that correctly, if you want any rice with your stir-fry you have to pay for it. And its not as if there is anything special about the rice - I saw them scoop the rice out of a huge vat in the back. The dish itself was not bad - I prefer tough tofu and theirs was mushy and it was small portioned for its $9 (without rice) price tag but not too small - but I just can't recommend an asian restaurant that charges you extra for rice. If they included the rice in the price, even if they charged more, I'd give them four stars, I just can't respect a place that nickel and dimes you.It was the first time I set foot in City North and it was up to me to choose where we were going to dine with our party of 4. I picked Ocean Prime. The venue is great, beautiful contemporary restaurant. It was quasi empty when we got there at 5pm for Happy Hour.
Sara was our server and she did not want to be there. No eye contact and she was in a hurry. No smile or barely. We all ordered two items from the happy hour menu which were $5 and $8 each. They brought us the parmesan fries which we did not order but we thought they came with it. We were charged for them.
Kobe sliders are dry and are definitely not Kobe beef. Truffled Chicken liver, not bad and generous serving. Cheese and meat platter: one had to look where to find the meat and the cheese. Chicken satay: good. I think the oysters were good too.Creme brulee and Baked Alaska: good. 
I would say: it's a nice venue, the server needs training, the cook also. The bill was high for a happy hour. Would I go back? ...I will try out some other ones on that street.So I have been here three other times since my last review. I've always had good experiences; good service and good food.
This time was a bit different however.
We showed up at 10:36am (I'm actually still here). There was one person in line in front of us. We placed our order a minute later. My dad ordered the breakfast buffet and was promptly told they stop service at 10:30. There was still plenty of food all still on display in the buffet line. He told the cashier he just wanted a couple pieces of sausage and some egg and would not be going up for seconds. She again told him no, they have stopped serving for nearly 10 min. Again, everything was still out and ready.
So he got a yogurt parfait and iced tea. The yogurt parfait was pretty damn good. Probably best I have ever had. I ordered the Cafe Chau Chau which was good (but shouldn't take 13 minutes to make right?)
So about another 7-10 minutes, right out on the floor, one of the employees is throwing away all the left over food from the breakfast buffet. Yes THROWING it away. And there was quite a bit food left over still. It didn't make sense that they would rather throw it all away rather than make a few extra bucks and serve one last person.Used to be an awesome place to study, now they bring in really really loud live music every night, and it really kills the vibe, because the acts aren't that good. Right now I am in a room full of students trying to study, and there is one guy playing a guitar on stage to an audience of one old couple and no one else... I really hope they stop this whole live music thing soon lolBreakfast brunch at the Venetian....Pricey is my complaint and I don't like the link sausage.  Stick with the  bacon.I just don't get it.

This is your classic Brazilian steakhouse type joint.  I think they are all kind of the same.  I will say the service staff and salad bar at this location are top notch.  The salad bar has several options and does not have any of the mess associated with your usual salad bar at restaurants.  Reservations for dinner are pretty much a must but while we were there I saw a little of everything in terms of dress.  Don't feel like you have to get dressed to the 9's at this place if you are not up for it.  The meat is good but after a while it all sounds and starts to taste the same to me.  At a little over $50 bucs per head it can get expensive quick.  I have no issue paying over a hundred dollars for my wife and I to eat out but for a buffet.  Not for this guy.Disappointing!  My hubby and I went here a couple weeks back on a Sunday evening around 7 pm.  That night was quite good, not real crowded and quiet.  Fast forward to this past Sunday, 12/16/12.  Oh my gosh!  What a difference 1 hour and 2 weeks make!  

We arrived around 5:45 p.m.  The place was crowded with a bunch of families.  The kids (pre teens, teens) were running around and I even overheard one say as he walked past "they f***ed up my cornbread!"  Really?  I waited at the carving station and asked for one slice of top round and one slice of turkey.  Mind you I had an empty plate at this point.  My turkey slice was more like half a slice and if I could shave my legs as close as the cook shaved my slice of turkey, I would be a happy camper!  It was so thin I could practically see through it!  After perusing all the food stations I ended up with salad, one piece of top round, one half-slice of turkey and mashed potatoes.  That's it.  My poor hubby ended up with salad.  We both had to steer clear of the ranch since it was a nice off beige color.  

A lot of the food stations were either empty, contained obvious old food, missing name plates so we had no idea what the item was or dirty.  There was a broken coffee mug on the floor near the Mexican station that the kids were kicking out of the way.  We ended up leaving about 6:10 or so and headed to McDonald's so hubby could grab some food.  

Between the type of clientele there that night, the lack of food and the condition of the food that WAS there I don't think we will be back.  We will stick with the Santa Fe buffet.I had my first visit to the J&G Steakhouse as a part of restaurant week.  Overall the experience was very disappointing and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  The meal took over three hours because the time in between courses was at least a 30 to 45 minutes.  This would have been more bearable if the food was worth the wait but while it was cooked perfectly the flavors were unremarkable.  I guess maybe because it was the fixed menu for restaurant week but rather than showcase their best dishes in order to ensure a return visit, they did the opposite and ensured I will never go back to this restaurant.  The flat iron steak was chewy and dry and came served with a side of french fries that would have been more appropriate next to a Big Mac.  The tomato soup was drizzled with truffle oil - a good idea in theory - but the truffles were so overwhelming that it was all you could smell or taste.  And the service was terrible.  I was served a drink and a glass of water when we sat down and not again until I hunted our waiter down before dessert was served and asked if we could please get refills.  Then, after my boyfriend told him he did not want another drink because he was driving he brought him one anyway.  When we got the check, we found out that this extra drink was $40 and we were being charged for it!  To sum it up, I miss Mary Elaine's.I happened to be hungry on the East side so I headed into the Cannery after reading positive remarks about their Mexican restaurant. Sadly, Casa Cocina (doesn't that just mean 'house of kitchen'?) is only open for dinner so we went to Snaps, their diner. Well, as you may have guessed the meal was pretty dull, but the highlight was the chicken soup. It was made from scratch, had a lot of flavor, and was well-seasoned. Most suprisingly, the egg noodles (someone in the kitchen knows the right noodles to use for chicken soup) were perfectly cooked without an inkling of sogginess. Had I ordered a bowl rather than a cup and passed on the sorry excuse for parmesan onion rings and cafeteria side salad I would have been quite happy. Just a little FYI in case you find yourself in the East Side Cannery and need something snappy....Eaten here many times and the food has been OK.

It seems ever since the Sunset Stations have gone into bankruptcy things have really cheapened up,but the prices have risen.

Small things keep this place from being a 3 to 3.5 star eatery.

The bread rolls are all ways stale(we're talking week old stale).
They used to have pepper mills.
Not any more.

The people that work there are friendly and efficient,but it seems to me like they aren't treated very well.  

It looks as if they work in fear of losing their jobs.

It just feels cheap.I give Posh two stars because obviously the food matters more than anything else at a restaurant, but I commend them for their terrific service and give them the benefit of the doubt that the night we visited was an off night.

For starters, when we made the reservation the night before, we were told we couldn't be accommodated at 7:30, but they could get us in at 8, or maybe a few minutes earlier. We showed up around 7:40 and in this huge restaurant with seating for probably 100, there were maybe 20-25 people. If they couldn't get us in at 7:30, at merely 25% capacity, because "they couldn't provide the best dining experience possible," as they claimed, then I can't imagine how they could ever handle a full restaurant. Regardless, we were seated right away and chose seats at the kitchen bar, to be able to watch the chefs in action. Our server came over and explained the restaurant concept to us and how ordering worked. I won't explain, since many others have already, but we both chose the 4-course chef's choice.

I won't run through all the dishes but, in brief, all of their food with the exception of one fish course and one dessert lacked flavor. Everything from the amuse straight through to the end was so one-dimensional...the flavor profile was so narrow...absolutely no depth of flavor.

After our first course, the manager came over and asked how everything was. We were honest about how bland everything was, and he said, "Let us try this course again for you." They did, and when he returned to see if this was better, we said yes because, at this point, we felt bad complaining about the food any further...but it wasn't.

We were very disappointed with our meal, especially after Seftel's glowing review and the great Yelp reviews. We spent much time speaking with the manager, who seemed to care genuinely about our feedback, rather than just indulging us in listening to our opinion. Posh is lucky to have such a great manager. He explained that he wasn't making excuses but that, due to the nature of their concept, they do have off nights where they look back the following day and say, "That menu didn't really work." He also explained that they don't follow a minimalist or "blandness" credo, per se, but that the chef doesn't want to throw out anything that will scare the diners, since people won't think to put "No sea urchin" on their card when they order. I understand this, but I think people who come to this type of place are fairly adventurous diners to begin with. Not only that, but you don't have to be too wild to give flavor. A little seasoning on the lamb and duck, a nice port wine reduction or orange glaze...give me SOMETHING to excite my palate!

They ended up taking 10% off our bill and I think they gave us a little bigger dessert, thoughtful gestures that further conveyed their commitment to customer satisfaction.

As we were leaving, the manager said, "You know, with prices like ours, we can't really afford to have off nights or people won't come back and we'll be here two or three more months. But I really hope you'll come back and give us another chance." Because he was so nice and because I really want this place to survive and do well, I'd love to give them a second shot. I just don't know if I can justify another $100 meal with the risk of it being off the mark when I can be assured of a stunning meal at Noca or other foodie destinations for the same cost.

I thank Posh for their excellent service, but if the food continues to let diners down, making it right with great service will be no substitute for not disappointing in the first place.Nothing really stood out or impressed me about this place.  Okay for a night or two. We were in town for a concert. It is on the same side of the strip as the MGM.   Only way to walk north on strip is to go through MGM.  What a disaster.  Constant construction that makes you weave your way up and down escalators, through the hordes of people at MGM and under scaffolding above the sidewalks.  Though it's not a fault of Tropicana, it was a pain to deal with.

The room was simple.  Expected amenities.  However, our sink backed up and we had to call for service.  He arrived timely, but he left a mess on the floor. The shower was weak-barely any hot water.  My wife was not happy. :(   They put the light switch behind the bathroom door, lousy planning. And the curtains were kind of cheesy. And the wallpaper was ugly and old.
There was no fridge and no micro. Bummer.
And since my wife loves TV, we were quite disappointed in the service. Reception kept going out, channel selection was crappy and the remote was old.  Couldn't figure out the channel numbers.
Small sportsbook.  And there were protestors outside the hotel in the valet area.
We decided we wanted to stay in Vegas another night and asked about available rooms on a Monday night.  They were booked. And reception told us if there were an opening, it would be triple the price we paid on Hotels.com.  Are they kidding? For this hotel?  On a Monday?
Will not stay here again.I was not impressed at all with this place at all. I went with a 4 other people. 3 of us ordered milkshakes and 1 got one of the $1 scoops. I tried two flavor to start and they were ok but nothing special or better than your average baskin Robbins. 

It was odd that on a Sunday afternoon only one employee was there and she was slow as can be, very nice but slow, took probably 4-5 minutes per milkshake to be made and she went one at a time. 

The cost was astronomical as well with 2 smalls running around $10 and not worth it. The only thing keeping this review was two star was that I was impessed with the final consistancy of the milkshake and it wasn't bad tasting just not anything impressive.Not sure why this place has all of the great reviews!  I've had better BBQ in Chicago and that pretty much sums it up!  BBQ sauce had no flavor!My first and likely last visit at this local meat market ( I mean bar). The only reason I went was out of curiosity and a free drink or appetizer for yelp check in.

If you are single, 40's and enjoy a place where you have to scream at someone who is 2 feet away so they can hear you, enjoy  lounge entertainment, this may be the place for you.

I do have to say the waitresses are super cute and there outfits are very easy on the eyes. 

I had the dirty martini with blue cheese olives ( you have to ask for those) It was not dirty at all, so she brought me some olive juice which I shared with another patron.

The mushroom and tenderloin flatbread was tasty. The shrimp martini tasted processed, chicken on a stick and tuna was disgusting and were sent back. So, 1 out of 4 appetizers hit the mark? I prefer 3 or 4 out of 4.

On a positive note, the mango mojito martini was VERY GOOD. That would be the only thing to bring me back. If you go, I hope your experience was better than mine.

Or and one more thing.... Valet parking for $6 bucks for a center that has only a handful of shops open?? SUCK IT! I will drive a block if I have to rather than get !@#^ in the a$$ by paying some douche canoe to park my car when the place is empty.  

Cheers...Pasta bar you are killing me!!!!! 

Great concept, poor execution. So much potential, the pasta itself is great, perfectly done and cooked but the sauces coming with it are all bad. They usually put way too much salt and the consistency is always wrong. 

It is such a shame, the pasta it seems wasted with those condiments..... 
Two star and probably one less costumer.I'm typing this on Vdara's wifi, sitting in room 31002, the day after Christmas.

This place is pretty awesome because there's no casino or smoking -- the vibe is really relaxing and chill. I love that aspect of this place. +1

The wifi is pretty awesome -- I actually did some work the other night. Speedtest.net's latency meter told me 22ms. 

The rooms are sexy, bachelor-pad-esque joints, with a dark brown, gray, and cream color scheme. The view is awesome (I can see the fountains in front of Bellagio, the 15 freeway, Encore, Venetian, the Stratosphere, Planet Hollywood, Aria, and so on, and that's just from the desk -- you can see more of Vegas from the dining room and living room behind me). The curtains are electrically controlled. Awesome. I felt so cool raising and lowering them by touching buttons.

The rooms are priced reasonably.

Those are the positives. There were a lot of negatives, too, which I felt were unbecoming of a hotel of this caliber.

The service left a LOT to be desired.

The front desk lady was great (the $20 trick got us an upgrade), but every other service interaction was lacking. The kitchenette is stocked with a Keurig single-serve coffee machine, but we could only find decaf coffee pods (... really?). After 3 calls to the front desk on Christmas Eve, we still don't have regular coffee in this joint.

The room has a pull-out bed, but there isn't any bedding in the room for it. It took 2 calls and about 45 minutes to get someone up to our room with blankets and pillows. They forgot the coffee pods I requested too. FML. Also, this pull-out bed is pretty horrible -- it's more comfortable sleeping on it as a sofa, rather than as a pulled-out bed.

The rooms also have super-thin walls, which is something I wasn't expecting since the rooms are so nice in every other aspect -- somebody was blasting the Tron Legacy soundtrack at 2AM. I'm a fan of Daft Punk, but not when I can't shut it off if I want to. You can also hear everything going on Las Vegas Boulevard -- all of the random police sirens and modified exhausts came through the windows.

Anyway, I hope they resolve the service issues, because of the rest of the hotel is pretty nice. Extra bedding and a choice of non-decaf coffee in the room would be nice. I'm unsure whether I'll be back or not -- we'll see.Nothing remarkable about this restaurant.  The Italian food is just average.  GF and I had two different entrees.  Neither was especially good.  She had chicken piccata and the meat was tough and veiny.   I had shrimp linguini.  Four (4) medium to small shrimp in a bowl of pasta half filled with water.  Even the waiter remarked that the chef failed to drain the water properly.  I had to send it back and ask that it be re-made.  After that, it was only fair.  There are tons of good Italian restaurants in Vegas.  Chose another.I really want to like this place, but it was just very forgetable and overpriced.

It was a cute place and the servers were fine. 

Basic issue is that the food wasn't special and it was overpriced. With tax and tip I walked out of here paying $10 for a bowl of oatmeal. It wasn't steel cut oats, just regular Quaker Oats you add water to and it was served with brown sugar, milk, cheap cereal stale granola and a cup of berries, mostly blackberries. It was a healthy portion of oatmeal, but it should have cost closer to $5. I did try the coffee cake, which was good but not out of this world.  

I would rather go to the Egg and I or Bread and Butter for the same price. You get a lot tastier food.Wow not great.  Was surprised because of so many positive reviews.  I would put this place "on par" with Macayos but no better...and that is not saying much.  

On the positive side the service was excellent.  The atmosphere was fine, pretty much like any other mexican place.

The food in my opinion was not what I expcted given all the good reviews here.  Chips were ok but the salsa was very watery and their "hot sauce" is more of a chipotle type thing than a red hot sauce.  I had enchiladas trio and it was well below average.  The beef one was ok, the cheese one was also ok, but the chicken one was barely even cooked.  Rice was seriously overcooked as well.  

Pretty much exhausted all the possibilities of mexican restaurants in Surprise.  They are all below standard...probably will head to Arrowhead area when we have cravings for this type of food in the future.Food was ok but the service was horrible everybody was rude for the price of the food I was expecting better definitely wont be going back thereAh-So Sushi & Steak is really a 2.5 star rating but only because my son loves the show the Chefs put on at your Teppanyaki grills.  If it was for my son giving you guys props this would be a 1 star rating. 

Restaurant ~ yes this place is laid out weird, may be it's due to the location.  It's sort of a triangle-ish shape with the bar placed at the front door, the sushi bar away from the regular bar, which doesn't make sense, and then regular dinning to fill the triangle with the teppanyaki grills at the far end.  I looks a little worn which is surprising since this place is fairly new.

Service ~ this is where they could use some help. It's hit and miss depending on where you sit and which server you get. My last visit was at the sushi bar and the service was a complete miss. She gave my order to the one sushi chef that was the busiest, so I waited and chatted with the other two sushi blokes while waiting for the first chef to find my order. Why not let he pencil something new? But no sir, we need to find your original order so we don't make you two. (what!)  I reached for my glass of H2O and my glass was sticky! GROSS! I was going to ask for a manager but that's when my server apparently got lost somewhere in the triangle vortex of this place and did not see her again for 15 mins..

Food ~ Sushi menu is very plain with only a few options so I ordered their  special sushi roll with spicy scallops on top of a California roll and some Hamachi sashimi.  The sashimi was ok, it didn't look very good but there was not fishy smell so I ate it.  Their sushi roll was crazy funny looking. It was not cut even at all, fell apart and the spicy scallops were mushy.  Yuck! I could not eat it.  

When we eat their teppanyaki grill, it's also a hit and miss depending on the cook your get.

Over all ~ Meh, I've experienced much better.Can't believe I spent $15 for a glass of wine that have finger print all over the glass. Did they ever wash it! Steak wasn't that good for $48 a plate. Took more then 25 mins after I finish my soup. Not recommend if you want to have steak here in Vegas.The service here could use some work. There's always a communication barrier.  And at one point, they ran out of biscuits. (?!?!?!?!) How does a place called Popeye's Chicken and BISCUITS run out of biscuits?! That's poor planning on the manager's part.Just another greasy spoon.Everyone raves about this place and I just don't get it. 
The food was ok but nothing special.The front desk service was really interesting. On a recent trip there after we checked out my girlfriend discovered she'd left her iPhone in the room.

The front desk refused to allow her to go back to look for it. The desk called up to the room where presumably housekeeping was working.

Nope, nobody had seen it.

Then my girlfriend persisted. Front desk still refused to get more involved and appeared to gather around joking that my girlfriend would make such a request.

Until we asked for the manager.

Then they actually had a bellman go with her up to the room. Long story short the bellman found the maid who had "cleaned" the room. While my girlfriend was standing there the maid produced an iPhone from her pocket.Sadly, a very disappointing experience. I picked Sage for our first night in Vegas because I thought it would be a great way to kick-off a foodie weekend. I gladly charged my way down the Chef's Specialty Tasting Menu.  Maybe my appetizer was an anomaly, but I did not like the Foie Gras Creme Brûlée.  Keep in mind that normally, foie gras, in all it's glorious forms, is a little bit of heaven to me. But over-processed to a flavorless, bland custard and layered with a thick caramelized shell of sugar? Paired with a thick, sweet dessert wine? It was a travesty and definitely not worth an extra $10.   But every restaurant has it's bad moments and I eagerly awaited redemption with the next course. The bacon-wrapped rabbit on top of a carrot purée ravioli with salsify sauce was not bad. It was a very small portion (two bites of rabbit), but acceptable for a tasting menu. Overall, nothing amazing, but a decent taste. The third course saw another okay flavor in a small package. I had the crispy pork shoulder. However, a single pork tenderloin medallion and a 3-in by 2-in by 2-in piece of crispy pork shoulder from a terrine didn't add up to my expectations. It was okay, but nothing special - especially when paired with a gag-worthy, overly-peppered red. And finally dessert - the low point of the meal. I wanted a light finish to the meal and ordered the pear poached in Riesling. The pear tasted like - a pear. But the 4 tiny slivers were laid out on a single, warped piece of phyllo dough beside an ice cream bite, sprinkled with thyme. And the ice cream? It tasted like a cross between a cheap Rouquefort and 'something funky'. I thought it very telling that when we asked for the mystery flavor to be decoded, our waiter apologized for the 'recent experimentation in the kitchen with black truffle oil' and offered to bring any other dessert.  I felt bad - he seemed embarrassed to have been involved with that fiasco of a dessert. But really - 
black truffle OIL ice cream?! Sorry Sage - your chef's taste's are definitely too "special" for me."Meh. I've experienced better."

the caption to the two-star rating lays it out perfectly. You really would expect more out of this highly stylish and modern cafe located in the newest hotel in Vegas, Aria at citycenter.

Cafe Vettro features high ceilings with floor to ceiling glass windows. Windows were complimented with exposed steel beams, and plenty of glass and stone decor throughout. This gorgeous cafe however, is brought down by the food which i can't speak as highly about.

I came here for breakfast and ordered their $16 omelette. For double the price of an omelette (with one less ingredient choice) than that of the Grand Lux Cafe at the Venetian, I expected it to be twice as good. Unfortunately this was not the case. The omelette was lackluster to say the least.. The cheese was a single slice layed out on top which left the inside of the omelette feeling very dry and tasting rather bland.

Coffee was an extra $4.50. Double the price of what you'd pay for a Venti coffee at Starbuck's. I don't mind this, but what turned me off about this was that our waitress brought me a cup, and left the thermal pot at our table. While this had a certain level of convenience, it lacked the personal touch and required attentiveness  most cafes and diners offer when our waitress returns to inquire if we'd like a refill. 

So overall while the ambiance was easy on the eyes, my wallet had a hard time justifying the $25 price tag for a boring omelette, and a less than personal experience. Next time we're just going to go to Denny's.Overall this place is less than average.  The service was pretty terrible and we had to wait about 20 minutes to get in, and when we finally walked in there were about 50 open tables in the place.  The line was at least 15 parties deep at 9am, a pretty good time to have breakfast in Vegas on a Saturday.  I'd pack it in and find someplace better next time.Stay Away Stay Away Stay Away!

There's literally 10 better buffets within a short distance.  I have NO IDEA how they could have come up with such a lousy buffet at such an expensive property but, shazzam, they did it.

Just not good.  The only reason I don't give it 1 star is because I reserve that for places that are nearly or actually inedible.The food is great, but the service leaves a lot to be desired. I particularly dislike it when the hostess says "How are we doing tonight"? Then the server says "what would we like to eat tonight?" when he come back to take the order.  That's so rude and condescending. We got the bum's rush as far as service is concerned. We were in and out in 35 minutes! I never got offered a refill on my iced tea either! Next time I am going to one of the independent Italian restaurants in town.The food was really good, so I wish I could rate them higher, but our service was horrendous. We had a very rude, abrupt server at lunch. We went there specifically for the advertised 5.00 lunch specials, when I asked him about them, as they were not even present on the menu we were given, he snapped at us and sighed "that's it". So, instead of getting any information whatsoever on the advertised 5.00 lunches (including confirmation they even existed, and we were there at 12:30pm), we got to pick from the regular pricier menu items. He took our order, brought us our meal, and forgot napkins or silverware. We then had to wait for OVER 20 MINUTES before we even saw him again, only to have him sigh with exasperation, and take another 5+ minutes to get our silverware. We finished our now cold meals in about 20 minutes, and never saw him once. 20 minutes AFTER we finished our meals and pushed our plates aside, we got our check silently slapped down on our table. The couple sitting next to my husband and I had a nearly identical experience and wound up leaving money on the table and walking out, versus waiting 20+ mins for their check. 

I feel like the 5.00 meals are false advertising, as there was nothing on the menu close to 5.00, either that, or they do exist, and our server basically lied to us to get a bigger bill/tip. Very irritating, we are not the type to complain, but we have both worked as servers, and we were just basically appalled with our cruddy service. The only reason I even gave 2 stars is because the pasta was pretty decent. Not the best I've ever had, but the pairings were creative, and the meals were solid.WOW.  I've been once for dinner and was completely disappointed from start to finish.  I couldn't believe the manager was wearing baggy golf shorts and flip flops.  The waiter looked so upset when we didn't want a wine list and whispered something to another waiter and they stared at us as if we were losers.  Food not so good especially the presentation.
I live in the area, but would not go back or recommend.I can go on for hours to describe the distaste I have for this place, however I will spare you the reading and simply state... This place overall, is no good!  I frequent this place, and gotta say, don't get treated as if I am a regular.  Not that I am looking for special treatment, but this bar has not once shown an ounce of thanks or gratitude for the amount of people I have continued to bring into their establishment.  I did give them two stars, because their happy hour special is what keeps them afloat.  A bar that gives the impression of an irish pub, should be an irish pub.  Not a late night dance club, who allows all girls to dance on the bar, and plays favoritism when it comes to kicking people out.  If you win happy hour, chances are, you may catch a buzz... if this is noticed by the bouncers, you're out.  And yet, they will allow all girls, even sloppy drunk, to get on top of their bar and show off for the egotistical drunken pigs slowly wallowing around this pathetic excuse for a bar.  McFaddens, I have heard many bad things about  you, and yet I continue to frequent your establishment.  As I said above, bravo for your happy hours, because I fret that without those, you would have no business.I'm so very sad about the review I have to write about this place.  I was so excited to go to Petite Maison.  I had gone to the Yelp event at the Science Center and was absolutely floored by how delicious the beef tongue with bone marrow au ju was at PM.  I immediately made a reservation for the following week to go to the real deal.  

We had a reservation for six people at 7pm.  We all arrived and were seated outside, which was fine since it was a beautiful night.  However, it took forever for our waiter to come acknowledge us.  Finally after about 10 minutes, he comes over and takes our drink orders and recommend some specials.  We ordered the mussels and scallops as appetizers and ordered our entrees.  Four of us wanted the duck breast, but they only had three left, so one of our friends ordered the pork tenderloin.  About ten minutes later he brings us some bread (almost like eggy popovers, very good), but he only brought out five, so we asked for one more since not all of us got to try it.  After about another 10 minutes, he does--by this time we all need a refill on our drinks but get no attention.

We get our appetizers finally, and they are pretty good.  The mussels are cooked perfectly with a nice light broth and the scallops are in a creamy white sauce.  Fast forward another 30 minutes and we finally get our main entrees.   The steak frites was eh.  Left much to be desired.  The steak was slightly tough and mostly flavorless and the frites were limp.  The duck breast (times three) was good, cooked just right, but the risotto was surrounded by a lake of broth which made it too soupy for some of us.  The pork tenderloin was on the dry side and not that great.  The last was the salmon which was "interesting".  It was an odd combination of flavors which didn't make it bad, but wasn't out of this world.  Half way through out entrees we flagged our waiter down (since he never came over to see how we liked our food), and ordered dessert--the souffle requires 15 minutes--turns out it was more like 30 minutes.

Finally around 10pm we got our dessert, two souffles and french two cream puffs.  They were good-but after having to wait basically an hour between the appetizer, entree and dessert, I was just looking forward to getting out of there.  We basically had to wave our hands in the air constantly to get anyone to come over to get anything.  What made it worse was that since we were a party of 6, we had 21% gratuity automatically added.  I can't help but wonder if that's why they chose to ignore us all night.

I hope others have better experiences here.It was "ok". I understand that there are different comics every night and so the show may change. However, they only had two burlesque dancers and they weren't complete songs so a total of a minute for dancers. Which maybe would have been fine if the comics were good.
However, the show is described online as having sexy women comedians and dancers. Every comedian was a guy, only one of the three was funny. Basically, I don't know about the validity of this show.I'm only giving it 2 stars for the very nice lady at customer service who assisted me- let's see if it works. 

Needed a product to my house by today. Didn't receive the package, checked online and the package was marked as the wrong delivery address....It's not a new address, and it's quite easy to find.

Called customer service, she confirmed that my address is correct per USPS website and put in a note for the delivery driver to ensure its delivered tomorrow. With all the bad reviews, we will see if that happens.

If I dont receive this package tomorrow, will be canceling my Amazon Prime account.Low-grade Chinese food. Veggies were not fresh; salmon sushi looked dry and gross. Overall: Bland. Sure, the staff was friendly and attentive but you come to buffets to swine-out and not admire the cheesy decor. Price should've been $4.99 for that buffet.My family and I were looking for places to eat, while in Vegas, and we came upon this buffet. We thought we'd try it out since it was an all-you-can-eat buffet for $9.99.

I thought, coming into this buffet, the food would be good. It was alright. The food was salty, and some were even cold. The service there was friendly, even though you could barely hear what they are asking you.I don't know man. My dude and I came in here for some drinks before our reservation over at Herbs & Rye and as soon as I walked in I had a bad vibe. I thought the bartender was friendly but the crowd was pretty shifty.  A random guy came over and just started bragging about his job and the people he worked with.  A woman from across the bar kept looking over at me, even after I gave her a good stare down. 
The best part was that 2 beers and 2 shots of Jameson came in under $10-15. 
 
 I like my drinks cheap and this place did that for me, but I also like to be comfortable in my surroundings.  Not sure if I'd come back.My review for Jollibee was months in the making. Somehow words were escaping me on how to best describe my experience here. I struggled on not turning this into a fecal focused review about the place. as you can see I failed miserably. Well.....

Holy Crap Batman, that is what I was thinking a few hours after visiting this fine restaurant. Now I am not one to be crude, but their food is not exactly easy on the bowels if you know what I mean. I give it two stars just because of the twisted names of some of their menu items,. I had the Aloha burger and it does mean hello and goodbye!Nice portions and friendly service. Good experience but I enjoy other places in the valley for a good breakfast.In a nutshell, this was Macayo's 2.0. Which by that, I mean it was decent fare, but not terribly authentic. It was a lot of food, newly decorated, and had good service, but it lacked a true "food as wholesome cuisine" quality  where the food comes first.

It felt a bit packaged and Mariachi pimped up. There was a blend of style mixed in with a blast of South of the Border Kitsch. Overly noisy at times, it had a nice busy vibe that was quite nice actually. It was inoffensive and had a bit of charm I wasn't expecting.

But for us foodies, the proof is in the pudding, so to speak. And here is where no amount of decor or feeling can overcome a food deficit if it exists.

This place breaks some cardinal rules of great Mexican restaurants. They apparently use vegetable shortening rather than the unctuous flavoring of lard. And the shredded iceberg lettuce topping on everything is so passe'.  Also, don't give me a huge plate with mostly filler and then try to soak me on cervezas and tequila shots.

Now I know Mole' sauce is regional, but this one was a bit gritty and a weird combo of overly sweet and tangy ( kind of like typical Barbecue sauce). It really missed that smokey, Earthiness that distinguishes a great Mole' sauce from the rest. 

The Sope's were a dense block of thickness where the potatoes outweighed the chorizo by a huge factor and the masa patty was ultra dense and crunchy where it should have been surprisingly light. And it was once again topped with iceberg lettuce. Why?! I don't know. Maybe they thought it looked better.

The Burritos were a winner. Went with a carne asada, re fried beans, and cheese. The tortilla was a little gummy though. But I think the Build your Own Burrito is a safe and wholesome bet if you go here.

The nicest thing I will say is that the service was pretty darn good. Places like this have usually negligent and missing wait staff, but here on a Friday, you get very good service.

Hate to be a naysayer, but this place is for average tasting Mexican food in a good-feeling atmosphere, but not much more..A few friends and I went to this place and before going in asked about a gluten free menu (I have a friend who cannot eat gluten).  We were informed that they do not have a gluten free menu but the wait staff can point out which items can be made gluten free.  Okay, sounds good.  We decide to eat there.  We sat out on the patio, which was very nice and not too hot with the misters going even in the heat of summer.  However when our waitress finally came over to talk to us about the menu the first thing she pointed out as gluten free was the one pasta dish on the menu.  Realizing that there is a disconnect on what it means to be gluten free she said she would check with the chef.  She returns to say no on the pasta (okay good call) and then proceeds to say that one of the salads would be good.  However the salad had blue cheese on it, which is not gluten free.  So, we realized quickly that they had no clue what it means to be gluten free and she was safer ordering the lobster with butter.  

I ordered the steak, since that is what they are know for, and was disappointed that it was overcooked and rather salty for my taste.  I would have asked to return it except that it took so long to get that steak and I had already witnessed the table next to us send something back to the chef (the Kobe burger which was undercooked for that table) and it took forever for them to return with a new order.  I sucked it up and just ate it.  

Overall I felt the place was over priced and poorly staffed.  Our waitress did not seem knowledgeable about the menu and as I stated earlier it did not appear that anyone understood how to accommodate a gluten free diet--after being told they could.  Plus the waitress was not slammed with tables and yet did not seem to be available to us or other tables for questions or refills.  I had high hopes since this is a Fox restaurant and I like so many of their places, but was very disappointed.  I doubt I would go back to this place and given it was not full on a Saturday night I don't think I am the only one who feels that way.Very slow service(50 minute wait).  Did not get us kids menus.   Salad had brown lettuce.  

This is not a good place to take kids.After hearing that this place was not only the talk of the town but also our esteemed President's favorite, I figured I'd give it a try.  Sadly, I'm not impressed.

There was nothing wrong with my dinner, but I expect a burger and fries costing $11+ to be more than just ok.  In the end though, Five Guys tastes like a neighborhood cookout.  The burger was fine--nothing unexpected, and the fries tasted homemade.  

They seem to be going for a less-is-more motif in the store.  Unfortunately, it just comes off as cold and cheap--In-N-Out does the clean 50s diner look a lot better, and Smashburger does the upscale burger menu better.

It won't kill you, but you'll feel like you got overcharged.Shopping a department store during the holidays and Yelp's Shop Local Pledge? 
FOR SHAME!
But hear me out, there are some things I simply can't find shopping the little guys. (Apologies to the entire small business community but I plan to spend some dough with you guys too!) 
Not really much to say about the place outside from the fact that it's a hot mess. At least in the men's section everything is way too close together, It's so hard to tell what collection goes with what, and bright red signs make you think things are on sale, but they're not. Use those little scanner thingies to check before you make your way to the cashier. I know during the holiday season you have to cut these guys some slack, we're lucky that everything is on a table or hanging and not laying on the floor right? Eh, I guess so. But I'm always prepared to spend more than I actually do at places like this because it's so hard to navigate and I wind up gettin' the sweats and have to leave.I have never been so disappointed in my life!  I have been waiting FOREVER to go back to Union in Vegas....just for the Union Salad alone!  But I also loved the ambiance and service that I felt they offered in a stellar way.
Well, to my dismay, I may just never go back after what I experienced.  My mom and I were sitting in the bar/lounge area waiting to be served.  My mom was the first to notice that are server had a bit of an attitude...which I didn't really noticed until it took over a half hour to have her come back so we could ask WHERE THE FOOD WAS!!!  She asked how everything was, and I asked her where my oysters, salad and my mom's food was.  Yes we didn't order a bunch of expensive items, but we should be treated with respect!

12/27/11 - Ok so I waited awhile to complete this review.  I was so friggin' angry when I started to right this.  I am still angry and I won't be back.  The end of the story was that our server never came back and we had to get two managers to get our food.  And it isn't like we wanted to have anything comped....but this is Vegas and this is also a high end restaurant.  The managers didn't even come back to check on us after we got served.  The server ended up coming back in the end to just hand us our check.  No apology...nothing.  Highly disappointed.  (And I am not high maintenance...I just am a big believer in customer service)Let me start this negative review by saying that I do adore Cartel's cobb salad.  Adore.

But I'm going to go out on a limb and say it should not take 20-30 minutes to make a cobb salad.  That's happened to me at least twice now.  The first time, the only person in the shop who could make a salad, apparently, went out to eat lunch...so I had to wait to eat lunch.  The second time, to be fair, I didn't time exactly how long it took, but I was able to listen to almost all of the new Rihanna album before I finally got up and asked for a status update.  And apparently, my salad had been sitting for who knows how long in the back.

I have now been to Cartel enough times so I know how to make this salad myself.  And I'm not going back.Chickens ok.  Their beef sucks.  Haven't tried the pork.  If It wasn't for the hot sauce I'd of not finished my food.  Don't know how or why this place is rated so high.  You've let me down fellow yelpersNothing great. Uninteresting menu.  Loud.staff here sucks.  it probably took my friend and my drunk ass about 5 minutes to get their attention while standing at only 1 display case.  (i'm sure they get a bunch of me walking around their store but i was literally stationed in front of a display case talking to my friend loudly talking about how i'm not getting any help and looking into the rest of the store at all other sales reps)

won some good money and it was burning a hole through my pocket.  i probably wouldve bought a wallet instead of the POS of a thing they call a money clip but their service didnt warrant me spending another minute in there.  if i was sober, i bet i would've walked out of there and went to another store instead.I usually go somewhere else for my eyebrows but it was closed at the time so I went here to Diva Beauty with my sister and got the yelp deal for $2 off. We walked in and were kind of greeted by the  receptionist. She seemed a little bored and wasn't smiling or being very welcoming, which was kind of sad. The lady that threaded my brows was nice but the threading was painful. I've gotten my eyebrows threaded dozens and dozens of times and this was the most painful it's been for me. In the end, my eyebrows ended up looking nice so I guess the pain was worth it. When we went to pay with our yelp deal, the girl at the counter kind of gave a little bit of attitude, but whatever. I'm probably only come back here when my other eyebrows place is closed for the day again.We went to the 1030 showing, it was pretty good but we expected a lot more out of the Garth and the Wynn for a $143 a ticket. He may have just been tired because it was his second show that night but they could have just had some guy off the street come in and play guitar and sing for two hours and it would have been about he same. The theater they have it in is terrible for acoustics especially up on the balcony so if you go make sure they put you on the lower lever. The process to pick up the tickets is painful and designed to make scalping impossible, which is great but at least allow the person who bought the tickets to pick them up for all the people in the group and get the wristbands and invisible ink stamps at the time of the show. Drinks are expensive but pretty strong. Nice publicity stunt Mr Brooks, love your albums but it would be best to go back into retirement...A very wishy washy place. They're always busy so you're bound to get rushed. As well as they try to cram more shit down your throat to get the price up! I'll admit there are a few people here that are very talented with nails. Too bad you won't get an appointment with them unless you schedule way in advance!

MOST IMPORTANT: When you go in or call ahead for prices make sure you it's 100% the same between everyone! They've been known for switching prices. You'll be told 10$ cheaper than what the grand total will be. When asked why they give you bs excuses.

A few bad experiences here:
1) My sister was told she couldn't get a design done from pinterest. The lady gave her about 30 seconds to think of something else. Then told her "I don't have time to wait for you so pick now" lol it was unprovoked and rude. 

2) Guy that usually does our nails became an asshole the moment my sister wanted something cheaper.

3) Another weird instance was we were told someone named "lily" was very good with nails. When we asked for her, the man immediately got defensive! He told us no one named lily has ever worked there. I swear I turned around and on one of the uv lights it said "lily" lol. Thought that was strange.

You may end up enjoying this place. I don't feel comfortable with people who can't be consistent with kindness or honest.One thing I can't stand is repeating myself. I told them which service I want and the guy his kept on trying to get me to pay more. Goodness. I said I was this and that's it. Just wash my car and vacuum the inside.I was driving past and saw a sign saying $5 haircuts. I pulled up to Kim's and parked directly in front of the door and decided to call and confirm that this was the barber shop doing $5 haircuts. My exact words "Are you doing $5 kids cuts?", her response "yes" to which i replied "OK, we're coming in". Short, sweet and to the point. I immediately unloaded my 6 yo and took him inside. Kim did a great job on his hair. very cute cut. I handed her $7 and walked out, when i started loading my kid into our luxury sedan she ran out and said the cut was $11. I reminded her that I just called and confirmed it was a $5 kids cut, she preceded to go on and on so i just paid the $11. I didn't understand what had happened until i got in the car and the other adult i was with said Kim had watched us leave the shop and load up before coming out, like scoping out the type of car we were in. I'm very disappointed, i feel like i was gouged for having a nice vehicle. had i known it was going to be $11 for a trim i would have taken him to my stylist. Make sure you agree to a price IN PERSON beforehand.Got my nails done on Friday and by Monday they were chipped. Pedicure lasted less than 2 weeks. The #4 pedicure is wonderful but not enough to keep me coming back.This can't be a real Rosati's. First, it's not even listed on their official webpage as a location. Second, their pizza tastes terrible. It's not real Rosati's.

Oh, and the people taking orders at the front desk? They have no clue what's going on. I called in an order for pick up and they somehow had my name and number on two different orders. They tried to give me both of them when I went in. No thanks, just want the pizza I ordered, thanks. However since the pizza was gross (as was the garlic bread with cheese), I won't be ordering again.Very loud hotel and the rooms were starting to look run down. Service was ok, could have been better. Japanese soak tub was dirty-yuck, wish I didn't pay extra for that. Gym costs $20 and internet is expensive too. Oh, and no cell phone service if you have A T & T. Good place to party though and the chandelier by marquis is beautiful.Order loads of food for multiple people at work. After an hour of waiting, we called back and were told that they "forgot to put in the order". They were nice enough to give us a small discount and upgrade some sizes of food. which would have been great but honestly with the quality of the food i could have done with a much smaller portion. 
Calzone - canned mushrooms??? That is never okay!
Greek french fries w/ feta - why call them "Greek french fries w/ feta"? All I got was microwaved french fries with a pile of mediocre feta cheese, guess I assumed there would be some sort of seasoning.
Chicken fingers(BBQ) - Drenched in BBQ sauce, how bout a side instead of pouring a jar of BBQ sauce onto tiny chicken fingers.
Fettuccine Alfredo - Why were the noodles stuck together? You know what, I don't want to know.
Buffalo chicken wings - I thought they should be crispy, wrong again.Friendly and helpful? maybe toward the women, but not the men [at least not me]. Far from it actually. They used to have negotiable prices. So when I went to pay I wanted to negotiate the price. I was practically cursed out and told the price was firm. They could definitely use more customer service skills. Another thing, there is NO RETURNS, exchange only. Make sure electrical components work before you buy them. Save your money and go online to LKQ, they are a HUGE warehouse [LOCALLY] and have lots of parts...best part about them, you dont have to pic it off, they do all the work and have a 6 month MONEY BACK warranty on most parts.Its way to greasy for my liking.  I used to love this place now my stomach hates itWent here with my mom. I got my acrylics removed and then just had gel put on my real nails. The lady barely soaked my hands in acetone and just took off the acrylics with fake nails. It hurt SO SO bad! So bad that she ripped my pinky nail up to my nail bed! I also wanted to keep the length, but she just cut off my nails. She did a well job on the gel manicure. For some reason, I feel like I got overcharged and I shouldn't have paid $45 for a removal and a plain gel manicure.... Also, the lady who did my mom's pedicure asked my mom what kind of pedicure she wanted. My mom only wanted a basic pedicure which is, I believe, only $25 or $30? The lady ended up doing another kind of pedicure for $40 without letting my mom know until she had to pay. And they talk about you in Vietnamese, but make it so obvious that they are. They did a nice job on my mom's toes, but the service is really what's important, and it wasn't the best.We came to this practice with high hopes based on these reviews. Our first consultation was great, Dr was very friendly. One thing was off he kept referring to our child as " the kid" but we liked him anyway. The next "emergency" visit was our first sick  visit. Our baby had been suffering from severe diarrhea and diaper rash. Dr quickly replied to emails and then after 2 days had us come in. That's when everything went sour! We were kept waiting in tut lobby which is not designed for babies or kids because this is NOT a pediatric office. As I said baby was suffering from severe diarrhea so we kept having to go to our car to change her because there isn't anywhere to change a baby that they could offer us. Dr was "running late" but after 1.5 hour we ran out of wipes and were pretty upset because we saw the lunch delivery from come in and everyone, even the front desk disappeared. I get that that happen, people run late and people need lunch but when you aren't on time, it shows where your priorities are. I would not recommend this office to anyone with an infant or toddler for that matter, it's clearly set up for adults. While the Doctor was clearly very intelligent and knowledgable what happened to us was insulting. I've waited months to put this post up because I thought if get over it, but I don't want anyone else to be "duped" by the 5 stars like we were.I love the taste and quality of the food at Rubios. However, this location my husband and I have been to 4 times and EVERY VISIT they have MESSED up the order!  The good thing is they are apologetic and remake it, but this last time they messed it up even after taking it back.  

The receipt will say the right thing, but the person actually making the food will do different.  1. Did flour instead of corn tortillas 2. Putting on sauces that we asked for not to be on the food 3. Chicken instead of steak. 

The food is good, and they were nice, and sorry for their mistakes, but the time & wait is not worth it. We will not return to this location, but will go to other locations.While I really like the hand-sliced sandwiches, this location's customer service leaves something to be desired. There were two teenagers behind the counter, and neither one of them were polite. For example, I kindly requested avocado on my sandwich, and one employee simply walked away disgruntled because their avocado bin was empty. The gentleman returned very upset and flung the items on to my sandwich, which caused some of the dressings to hit the protective sneeze-guard.  

In addition, this location tends to make sandwiches for everyone in line at the same time. This isn't efficient for the customers that have come in first. 

I won't be returning to this location; there's another Port of Subs a few blocks away where they are friendlier!Went here after reading reviews on this place and were very disappointed.  We had tickets to the Smith Center and this is right across the street so we thought we would get dinner group of four and then the show.  Our waiter didn't really want to be there.  He didn't explain anything, and when we asked how a dish was his response for every dish is "it's good" but sounded like "eh I don't care."  They brought our drinks in all different types of glasses, so your first mojito in a big glass and then a tiny glass for the second but still the same price.
The food was not at all great for the price you are paying.  I got the filet and I asked medium however it was more well and only a tiny dab of sauce on the side, not enough to actually taste it (the sauce was the best part).  For dessert we were asked, "what would you like for dessert?" Yet no one had shown us a menu.  The service was slow and they were not that busy.

Overall I felt like it had a lot of promise walking in, I did like the decor and the feeling when you walk in, but the service and food let me down.  :(Robby and Mehgan you rock !  If it wasn't for the absolute best service from Robby and Mehgan I wouldn't go back there again.The butch female with a guys hair cut and flesh tunnels in the photo department. You are a mean person.This Albertsons feels like one of their lower end stores. It's not as clean and well laid out as more suburban locations. I went in here to use the DMV Kiosk which had issues (big shock there), and I ended up in the store for a couple of other things. It's got the typically slow checkouts, and even more overbearing helicopter security types who like to follow you around  and hover around you. Sorry Security dude, I don't need to steal from your lame ass beer selection at 8:20 am. I can pay for my crap. Get lost. Anyway if you find yourself in this part of town it's not bad, but I do feel sorry for anyone who uses this store on a weekly basis. They're not getting the best Albertson's experience. 

The parking lot has some interesting characters lurking around, and I almost got hit 4x getting in and out of here. If someone ever wanted to film "Worst drivers of Las Vegas" this would be a perfect place to setup a camera.typical Asian ran business. the drinks are ok, nothing to rave about. the service is no bueno.

DO NOT get the avocado smoothie, after one sip, i tossed the thing in the nearest trashcan. 

Do try the lychee smoothie, it's refreshing and what earned this joint two stars!We bought four trees from Star.  Instantly, all became sick.  We called, and for $60 a tree doctor would come out and look at them. Um, no.  We went in, and we were told that the first person we bought the trees from was wrong, and we had not used the right kind of mulch.  Great.  There's $80 wasted.  We got the right stuff, and one tree instantly dried up and died, but the three came back. This tree's carcass was just returned to them. Now, even though we were told to just bring it back with our receipt, we had damage done to our home and the receipt was destroyed. I had my bank statement in hand and had already spoken to the manager.  I was told "Well, this has to go through corporate so we may know in a few days'--I had already called about this 3 days ago.  I argued and argued, and finally got a store credit (he said he couldn't find my purchase but come to find out, he was trying to refund me too much for too big a tree), but he said he may lose his job over it.  I'm not sure how doing the right thing makes you lose your job??? That says a lot if a company is going to fire a manager for standing behind their warranty.

In the meantime, the three surviving trees started to die.  We looked it up and spoke to another  nursery, who stated that Star had told us a totally wrong watering schedule, along with the wrong sort of fertilizer a SECOND time, and to try changing our watering around.  Voila.  

Inconsistent information and us having to constantly nag and follow up to place orders for more trees...in the words of Sweet Brown, "ain't nobody got time for dat."I am a fan of sonic. Especially the experience but this one in particular is inside Walmart. The staff is often times looking drained and not pleasant. They charge for drink refills and close off most of the sitting areas more then 50% of the time that I've been there. Only reason I keep coming back is I have children and unfortunately this is the Walmart I frequent often. I really wish they would learn to SMILE and be a bit more attentive and stop closing down more then half of the store because they don't want to have to clean it after 6pm.I was a walk in for an eyebrow waxing.  Place was clean.  I didn't have to wait, but the lady who did the waxing stopped in the middle of doing a manicure? with another lady.  I think this made her do a rush job.  If not, then she is just not very good at eyebrow waxing.  When I got home, I still had wax on me.  My right eyebrow is thinner with a high arch.  My left is thicker with no arch.   I have never had an uneven job like this before.  Had to fix it myself.  I am not a happy camper right now.  Ugh.Meh...is the best descriptor.  

 I eaten there for lunch and dinner...food is adequate at best.   On the other hand, service is terrible.  People who work there are friendly enough, but for some reason, the kitchen routinely (happened at every table the night we ate there) sends appetizers an entrees out at the same time.

Food, as noted is adequate.  Chicken satae was basically chicken tenders of a relatively flavorless variety.  Nam Sod was ok.  Pad Thai was noodles, pork and a few peanuts.  The sauce tasted of ketchup.

Place was virtually empty on a Friday night.  Based on the food and service, I know why.Good bloody Mary bar; not $16 good, but good. Great strawberry mojito; well worth whatever I paid for it. They drew me in with their fried bologna sandwich. Totally gross, I know. In my defense, I grew up with fried bologna sandwiches and have nostalgic memories attached. The bologna wasn't fried enough for my taste! The Texas toast was too buttery and way too much mayo.I agree with Jessie B. on this store. Most Lowes' stores tend to hire a few really knowledgable employees and the rest are people just taking money or answering simple questions (i.e. what isle do you keep the Gorilla Snot on?)

This store is clean, well organized, and I've run into really fabulous and accomodating employees here. There are so many reasons why you should come to Lowes to do your home improvement shopping, however I have one gripe. 

My and my husband purchased paint for our bathroom recently, a specific color from an actual color card. When the young man from the paint department mixed our color, he didn't make sure the can was centered and a lot of the dye that makes the color didn't end up in the can, it was all over the rim. We checked out without noticing and got the paint home. He ended up doing other projects and left me to paint the bathroom by myself. Not knowing anything about paint, I cracked the can open and started painting. Instead of a mellow green it was literally fleurescent, startling lime green. My bathroom was glowing like radioactive material. Seriously. It could blind you. 

Shortly after painting a good chunk of the bathroom, I finally allowed myself to be worried. I thought my eyes had been playing tricks on me at first and had consoled myself with the fact I don't know what I'm doing and it was probably just my bad eyesight. Wrong. My husband jumped when he saw the color and pointed out the dye that was all over the side of the can instead of in it. Insisting that they messed up, he took the can back. 

His argument was clear: we paid for "Lettuce Alone" and ended up getting something that resembled "Radioactive Waste From A Cartoon." Even though his silly wife used a good amount of the paint, it wasn't the color that they sold us, they obviously messed up and didn't tell us (I doubt the kid overlooked the dye on the side of the can as he sealed it shut). He would like an exchange please. 

The manager of the department refused and he was turned away. He tried to see a general manager, but they told him they weren't going to waste any more time debating the issue. Paint was non-refundable, even if it wasn't the color we paid for. After calling corporate Lowes my husband got his exchange. But we wasted so much time. I completely realize that under normal circumstances you can't just bring back a half filled paint can and say, "I want to return this." However, the title of the color card was in bold print on the can, and it wasn't this color. Just toss the can in the "Oops Paint" section you have in the back and keep a loyal customer.I went here on Father's Day and the food was terrible. The eggs were so dry, they crumbled and fell apart when I tried to pick them up with my fork. The potatoes were cold and soggy too. The only reason I have them two stars is because I went there a few months ago and the grilled cheese was decent.Overall felt like the food lacked flavor. The jambalaya and gumbo seemed blah to both of us. The BBQ shrimp and cornbread were both good.I usually eat at fast/cheap Mexican places because I am not a fan of places like Garcias, macayos, Arriba etc but I have been looking for a good/authentic sit down Mexican food restaurant for a while. After I saw that this place had a 4 star rating and a name in Spanish I decided to give it a try. I was pretty excited to see actual Mexicans eating there! When the chips and salsa arrived my excitement died a bit but I try not to judge on chips and salsa alone. We ordered a plain cheese crisp as an appetizer and it was actually pretty good; it was crispy and not too oily. The main dishes arrived and they were a major disappointment! The tacos were oily and bland. The beans and rice were not much better. Overall this is typical Americanized Mexican food; overly fried, bland, and greasy like most Mexican places. Nothing special or authentic here. I shan't be returning. My search continues...I had heard a lot about this place, so was excited when I finally got to eat here.  Sadly, I was not impressed.  The salsa was mediocre, and my chimi was soggy and tasteless. The beans were tasteless as well. Will not be going back.Let me preface this review by saying that I MAY try this office again just with a different doctor. Dr. Drewitz  (and a few others) got pretty awesome reviews elsewhere online and was a peer-voted TOP DOC in the Phoenix Magazine. While that's not the patients voting, Yelpers, I suggest you do your own research. 

Note: I will update my review if I need to go back.

Now to my experience. I called with digestive stress thinking it was a pretty serious episode that I was having. They got me in quickly but with a young doctor that hadn't received very good online reviews. They were quick to assign this one to me and although i was leery, I decided to just give this guy the benefit of the doubt.

As another Yelper just before me mentioned, although I don't know if we had the same doc, the bedside manner was virtually non-existent. While he may just have a laid back personality, professionally, I prefer my docs to act like they give a shit.

So then after asking me a few perfunctory questions about my current symptoms, he does the "stethoscope to the heart and back" routine and sends me to a kind woman to schedule my CT scan at a local Imaging place. Again, they got me in pretty quickly.

Here's where it went awry for me. I went in for the scan on a Friday and the CT techs said the drs. office would receive results in 2 to 3 bus. days. I called Digestive Health Center - Coronado in 4. They had the results but the dr. had to sign off so someone could tell me my results and hadn't. Meanwhile, I'm beginning to panic cause NO NEWS IS BAD NEWS when you're a patient with a condition.

EIGHT BUSINESS DAYS LATER, I call back like WTF? The assistant was apologetic but noted he STILL hadn't signed off on my results. Now remember , that this is simply so they can tell me something IS or ISNT wrong with me. Jeez!!!!!

So I said I need another doctor then. An hour or two later another doctor calls back to tell me all is fine. For this frustrating episode, I receive a dang near $200 bill (after insurance pays their part and note how quickly THAT arrived vs. how slow the follow up was) and after paying $350 out of pocket for a CT scan. So $550 of my hard-earned- and- not- easily- come- by savings later, I am ok but seriously do not feel the service I received was worth it!I went to this pizza joint based on a word-of-mouth review from a fellow co-worker (who used to frequent the place years ago). He said that their meatball subs were good and he described it as a "nice little spot" that he remembered enjoying.

Looking online for their web site before-hand, I discovered a simple godaddy placeholder page with their logo and address along with a "coming soon" notice. Every business out there needs a web site, and it's especially important to put your restaurant menu online, so this should have immediately been a warning sign for what was to come.

When my friends and I arrived at the Manhattan Pizzeria, we were surprised to discover a total absence of sausage or pepperoni options. Apparently, the restaurant has recently been "koshered" and now only serves vegetarian options and fish-based meats. This came as quite a surprise, because the name of the restaurant was still the same, and we didn't have any fore-warning from their web site.

We decided to roll with it anyways and give it a chance, ordering a couple of slices of pizza with various vegetarian toppings. One of my friends ordered a sub sandwich that had salmon on it.

As we sat waiting at our table, ten minutes went by, then twenty. Right as we were really starting to get antsy (after waiting for almost a full 30 minutes), they brought our pizza slices and the sandwich out to our table. This struck all of us as a bit of an excessive wait. The place wasn't busy with other customers, and the food we ordered was pretty basic. Any decent pizza joint should have been able to toss the various toppings on their pre-made cheese pizza stock slices, pop them into the oven, and deliver them nice and hot to our table within 15 minutes (at the most). The idea of having to wait a full 30 minutes for this really put a damper on the overall lunch experience.

To top it off, the pizza was mediocre at best, and the salmon sub sandwich was a bit bland.

In summary, if vegetarian (or Kosher) pizza, pasta, and sub sandwiches are what you're after (and the idea of fish meatballs sounds good to you), then this is the place for you! Don't go unless you're willing to wait, though.

Also, I *really* think that the new restaurant owners should have completely renamed the place if they were going to take over and completely change the menu the way that they apparently did. Phoenix is a big place with a lot of people who have no doubt gone to the Manhattan Pizzeria over the years, and if you keep the same name, they are going to expect the same experience and the same types of food that they had in the past. Completely changing the name would have avoided the disappointment of un-met expectations.Meat has decreased in quality over last couple of years. Lukes, step up your game.Not sure how they got four stars. The place is cute but that's about it. It is unkept and feels dirty and old, it has a potential of being a great little cafe if they would serve good food. 
Often run out of ingredients, the sandwiches are not cheap and they don't give you much for your $.We had a 60+ person luncheon event here and I'd say the service and food were marginal. For example, I made the mistake of ordering my salad with dressing on the side. This caused 59 people to be served and one to sit and wait at least 15 minutes for lettuce and tomato assembly. These guys may be fine for dinner, but I'd never do another group event. They were a pain in the butt to deal with.oh how i wished i check yelp before taking our concierge's advice about eating here.  the food was not good and was VERY pricey, i wish i went to the capital grille if i knew we were going to drop this much money, at least there i would have gotten a great steak and been satisfied.Only the Biltmore Apple Store can make the typical shopper (me) feel like a total douche just by walking inside of it to be exposed to the cultish behaviors of Apple fanboys and girls.  This must be, like, the Ganges of Apple secularism.  One might introspect, "Is this me?"

No.  Its okay.  You certainly aren't one of the tools extolling Steve Jobs father's testicles for blessing the planet with the Divinity who created the most streamlined electronic products ever exalted on God's green Ge.  But look around, and this is what you will see at this particular locus.

Interacting with the sales associates, these coal-shirted devotees, is what I imagine Muhammad faced when he met his 72 virgins in heaven.  These virgins, however, are massively haughty and generally useless. 

In order for one of them to grace your presence and acknowledge your need for assistance, one must either 1) act like you're walking out of their store with one of their pretentious product under your shirt, or 2) make an appointment with their "Genius Bar".

F me running.  What a crappy state of affairs customer service is at this place. 

Let me get this straight, I cannot get anyone to help sell me overpriced, buggy Apple products unless I had the foresight to book their arses a week before?  Moreover, should the frequently occurring Apple jinx strike my iPod, its gonna take an appointment to tell me that you cannot fix it because you are not, IN FACT, a genius, but a $10 an hour fandork of Apple products and you wanted the 5% employee discount?

The 2 times that I've had problems with my iPod (i know, what a shocker!), they've just suggested that I reformat, thus erasing all of my files and losing playlists, et al.  Thanks genius.  Thanks for keeping up the good fight vs Microsoft, dweeb.

And thanks for allowing me to check out -- not at the cashwrap, but right here, where we stand -- amongst the packed section of iPhones, where people are dorking out to these things.  I appreciate the dapper service, even though I'm plopping down the loot for two 'pods (which will inevitably be returned for two new ones in a few short months after I stump the geniuses over at the bar).  

Now, I'm just blue-skying here, but how about you treat me like an actual human customer instead of an ATM machine, given that I've purchased 6 or so Apple products within the past 4 years?   

I hate that Apple has been crushing the portable music market for several years now because their outposts for customer service are absolutely abysmal.I came here at 2 pm on Wednesday and there was a line out the door. My first thought was "doesn't anyone work anymore?" or do they all work nights like me?

I ordered the stacked turkey sandwich, the line moved pretty quickly and the girl at the counter was friendly. The next problem I encountered was finding a place to eat my sandwich. Here is hint: Remove all the pretentious crap (what they call "grocery") and put some more tables in the place. Focus on the food and the customers.

Now to the sandwich. What is the Cardinal Sin in sandwich making? The wrong bread, and yep, they did it. They used thin, flimsy 9 grain bread to hold together a stacked turkey sandwich, and after one bite, it all fell apart. So I was left to eat all the ingredients of the sandwich a la carte like a Thanksgiving meal. That's too bad, because it was obvious everything was great quality, and had they used Italian, French, Ciabatta, etc.,  I would not be giving this a 2 star review.

I may possibly return (am in no hurry)  for the treats, or a cappuccino and breakfast. The sandwich experience was too irritating to give another try, especially when a few blocks away The Vig is serving the best damn sandwiches in Phoenix.Definitely a mixed review for me. I am a total newbie to biking, and my first call was taken by a female who was so helpful and patient with all my questions. I decided that I would definitely bring my bike and my husband's bike in for what we needed. The next day I called to ask how long the service would take, and I spoke with a guy who was a  rude jerk. I didn't want to take the chance that he would take care of  me when I brought my bikes in, so I went to another bike shop near by where EVERYONE was nice and helpful.Absolutely typical mid-range Chinese fair. The Pu Pu platter that other reviews raved about was middle of the road, with the eggrolls at the low end and beef skewers a bit better than average.

The House Special Sesame Chicken was good, but nothing special, and a bit too sweet for my taste. The Moo Shu Pork was not bad at all, but was absolutely typical of the dish.

In general, it was slightly above average for typical Chinese food fair. Nothing special to remember the place, and there are a dozen others like it in town.

At 6pm on a Saturday night, we were the only table when seated, with two other tables being seated afterwards, but there were at least 5 phone calls for takeout while we were there, there was certainly nothing about the decor to recommend eating in versus takeout.It's better than nothing. 

If you work in the area (16th and Morton) and have a limited amount of time for lunch, or if you didn't have time to eat breakfast in the morning the Veranda Bistro is for you. You will be completely not-excited-but-not-disappointed by this exactly as expected food. 

The breakfast menu is essentially 4 ingredients (egg, meat, cheese, starch) served in several varieties. They all pretty much taste the same. One warning, the home fries are typically undercooked. The eggs have an amazing characteristic, that being the ability to crumble into a pile of bits too tiny to be picked up with a fork. I sense some breakfast fairy magic at play. 

Lunchtime is a bit better, with several sandwich options, both cold and hot. There are salads and soup, and a variety of deep fried snacks. I've eaten a few of the cold sandwiches, and they are moderately tasty. The salads are premade and sitting in a cooler, which makes for some drippy lettuce. 

Speaking of lettuce, I would love to meet the monster that's strong enough to cram THAT MUCH lettuce into one container. I'm not exaggerating when I say I pulled off enough lettuce to make two more salads of equal size. No one in this world needs that much lettuce in one sitting. 

Veranda Bistro serves a valuable purpose and is blessed with a great location. It's the only restaurant within walking distance for a few thousand people. I only wish that they tried a little harder rather than delivering exactly what I expected. Curse my low expectations!Guess I grew up with different Chinese food in Chicago, Denver, Baltimore, which was good.  This is my second takeout try in Phoenix, and is the worst I've ever had.  Egg foo yung was mushy and tasteless with a watery sauce.  Shrimp with lobster sauce also had little flavor and a very watery sauce.  Appetizer spareribs had a lot of fat and gristle. I promise you I can't afford to throw away food, but this is that bad.Came in today on a whim during my lunch break with a coworker. Place was your average bar an grill with basic food you would expect. They had pretty good lunch and drink specials. I ordered the green pork burrito from the lunch special menu and we got some wings since they were also on special. Wings were average and sauce was clearly store bought but they were juicy and cooked well. The burrito again was good but nothing special. What really held this place back was the service. Our waitress was stone faced and unfriendly. She overcharged us for the burrito and then acted like we were inconveniencing her and didnt even apologize. Im ok with mistakes as things happen but to act that way was ridiculous. I would probably not bother coming here again.The food was awful, but the service was fantastic!  The service is the only reason it's getting 2 stars.  My husband had one of the burgers and he said that it taste like a frozen burger patty.  I had the Kobb salad...It just wasn't good.  We did have the nacho app...Half the cheese wasn't melted, and if you wanted any beans or meat on it, it was extra.  Over all the nachos weren't bad--only because they were part of the half price apps during happy hour.  It was pretty crowded--I literally think my pony tail was touching the girls pony behind me, and there were a lot of kids.  I would say, don't wast your time/money here.My wife and I were visiting from Southern CA and had a hankering for sushi. If you appreciate fine sushi, DO NOT eat here. The restaurant is somewhat dingy, and the sushi chefs are not overly responsive. We ordered a rainbow roll that was halfway decent, but the crunchy roll was horrible and had dried noodles on top. This place deserves a pass .Sky Harbor is one poor gateway to the city of Phoenix and the Valley of the Sun.  It is outdated, super crowded, it feels dirty and it is the home of US Airways, the biggest carrier in and out of this airport.

Terminal 4 is configured rather poorly.  The terminal reminds me of a backwards E, like the second E in EMIN3M, except that there is another prong to the backwards E.  The concourses are not spacious at all, the seating limited, and consequently the crowds spill out into the walkway areas.
.  
To go from one end of Terminal 4 to the other necessitates using really narrow moving walkways which are on the spine of the E.  It is really hard to maneuver if you want to pass the throngs given the limited space.  The distances are long, the bruises will be many, either to you but most likely given by you as you negotiate your way between flights.

The other thing that must be mentioned is that Sky Harbor is not a business person's airport but rather a tourist airport.  I think that contributes a lot to the chaos.  When an airport is full of amateurs, like Sky Harbor, there are bottlenecks of humanity in all the wrong places.  Further exacerbating the tourist nature of this airport are the snowbirds who flock here so that they can seek skin cancer in all months of the year, not just summer in their native habitats of the Upper Midwest.

Get going on the remodel since it is long overdue and make sure you take in mind the tourists and the business traveler when updating this airport.I'm only willing to give this a 2 because I think the restaurant has potential.  I've now gone twice because my friend stands by it being the best in the area.  Every time I've gone, the servers completely ignore us.  During the first time, it took about 10 minutes to get a menu.  Maybe another 15 to get a simple gin & tonic.  When the server finally decided to come back around to see if we wanted to eat (we'd been looking for her for a while) we ordered a small amount of food.  20 minutes later a new server delivers the food (which was warm and awful).  We sat around for about 15 more minutes waiting for our checks (which were delivered by yet another new person).  They finally take our money and also take their sweet time bringing back the change.  I will openly admit that I did not tip.   I forgot to mention that this was at night.  It was a little busy, but eventually completely died.  After the crowd disappeared, we still got completely ignored.

The second time I decided to give it a chance, we went for lunch.  The service was a bit better.  I could only assume that the other person helping our server was the manager.  He flat-out lied to my face, which upset me very much.  I asked for a gin & tonic again.  The server goes to put that drink order in and the manager comes up to me saying their out of both gin and tonic.  I ordered a vodka cranberry instead.  It was awful.  Probably no vodka in it.  My friend pointed to the shelves of liquor where there stood in plain sight a bottle of Tanqueray and a bottle of Bombay.  Thanks manager for being such an asshole.  Once again the food came out at a warm temperature.  It was very hard to keep down.  

After the 2nd trip, I've decided not to come back.  It's awful service, management, and mediocre food.  I highly advise that the owner or GM takes a good look at his staff and the way things are being ran.  It's a bad restaurant in every way.Rustler's Rooste is a venerable Phoenix tradition.

Many people have come here and had a great time.

I last came here for an event with former students from my college, so my experience is probably atypical.

Our event was part update on whats happening on campus, part memorial, and quite traditional.  We do it every year.  This was perhaps, the wrong venue for us.  We did not have the solemn atmosphere that the memorial part of the event demands, and the other groups around us were having so much fun that I could barely hear the speaker.

No wait staff were required for our group, so I can't tell what service might be like as a regular diner.  Our meal was a buffet style bbq chicken dinner, which I probably would avoid if I could. It was a bit overdone, to the point where it may have been better to skip the chick half and make do with the beans (bland), corn (waterlogged cobbettes), rolls (good for crumbs, but not much else), and the afterthought salad.

If I didn't know that much of my fee was going to scholarships, I'd think that I got ripped off.Does anyone expect a lot from a Chinese buffet?  Should they?  There were excellent ones in Washington DC, so I know they exist.  Should I temper my review with the knowledge that most Chinese buffets are far inferior to this one?  Does that make this place any better?  Sigh, I don't even know where to begin.

The place is not disgusting inside - if you want to call that neat or well-decorated, I don't know if you can.  I don't think I'd go that far.  Servers are fast and attentive with drinks and clearing plates - you have to appreciate their hustle.

The majority of the items on the buffet are absolutely, unequivocally ordinary.  If your mission is to eat as much food as possible for as cheaply as possible, this would be an excellent place to do it.  Seafood is especially fishy and most items seem as if they've had a long-life under the heat lamp.  Mongolian BBQ (which I'm a fan of) is a low-frequented item here, and the veggie selection illustrates this clearly.  There are maybe 5 roughly chopped vegetable choices, a confusing selection of sauces and a couple trays of meat melting in front of you.  Not terribly appetizing and the final product is as lackluster as you'd expect.

The only true deal is the sushi, of which you can eat copious amounts of and have prepared for you fresh and on demand.  It's not exceptionally good quality, but at a place as low ticket as this, it's a welcome addition to see something being made fresh for you.

Would not go back, and the result of reading many of the reviews here leads me to believe that if this is supposed to be the best of the bunch, I might as well give up hope on the concept of the exceptional Chinese buffet in Phoenix altogether.Apparently I am not getting this place. The service was eh (my younger friend and I didn't look like we were flashing dough I guess, despite a large bill) and really, I've had better food MUCH MUCH cheaper elsewhere.

My friend and I went there recently. We had a giftcard and she heard it was a great place. It was gorgeous, I'll give it that. The prices are outrageous for the portions. It is very arty and portions were tiny. I am a small person who doesn't eat alot, but I left hungry after a $30+ dinner!!!

I had the scallops, which were good, but there were literally 5 scallops, 2 TINY breaded mushrooms and a cake of rice, about the size of a half deck of cards. WTF?  The only thing appealing about dinner was the basil strawberry margarita. 

Sorry, I just can't recommend that you come to this place, unless you love spending tons of money on tiny portions!For $30-40 per entree, you can do far better.  The macadamia crusted mahi mahi is bland as sand with nothing to compliment it but blander potatoes and a few sprigs of asparagus.  Surf n turf boasted a decent filet but an extremely petite lobster tail, with a purée of something between the two that starts out bland but finishes like black pepper.  Waiter forgot my wife's glass of wine despite knowing this was a wedding anniversary dinner for us.  Made zero effort to make it right.  Dessert was only saving grace.  We will certainly look elsewhere for fine (or even moderate) dining.Broccoli had mold on it and breadsticks were stale . Even when I asked for new breadsticks and they were still stale. I like the idea of unlimited soup, but it was not worth time and money.I read the other Yelp reviews while I was sitting in this restaruant.  Too late. 

Here's the deal - the other reviews are spot-on about the service.  Friendly, happy, and attentive.  

The food though, is NOT so fantastic.  I ordered a Belgian Waffle and my hubbie ordered French Toast.  Both tasted deep fried, which is totally weird.  The butter was in little sealed Shamrock Farms tabs on the table, and was not kept cold, which I found extremely odd.  I mean, overall, the food was okay, but I woudn't recommend it to a friend, so I don't recommend it to you.  Everything came out ordered the way we ordered it, but it just wasn't that great.

The restaurant was clean, but our waitress had animal hair on her black t-shirt, which unnerved me more than a little.Shame on me for going to a chain Italian joint, but we were in the area and soup salad and breadsticks sounded good.  I have not been to an Olive Garden for maybe 7 or so years, and WOW have they gone downhill.  

Food is ok, not good.   Service was poor at best.  Waited for drinks, waited for food, waited for check much much longer than we should have.  

Learned my lesson and will not be going back (to this location anyway.)Great beer selection. Great specials. Frustrated when our clueless server didn't offer happy hour prices 4 minutes before happy hour and then still didn't offer them when we brought it up.This WalMart REALLY needs more cashiers, especially at night. One lane open at 10pm? That's okay if there's only a few people checking out. However, when there are 20 people in line for one register and at least three employees walk by, two of which were clearly cashiers, and there is still only one register open, there's a problem. 

There have been numerous times I have wanted to buy something, but didn't have 20 minutes to wait, so I put what I could back without wasting too much time and left. I know I am not the only person that has done this. 

Even during the day when there are copious amounts of people, there never seems to be enough cashiers. Why not do the local economy a favor and hire more? Or does the manager get a bonus if they can get employees to do double the work for a third of the pay? 

That being said, if you can get a hold of Wendy or the other managed (his name escapes me) and you have a legitimate concern, they will help you out. Wendy does a lot for the community, and it is probably corporate's fault she can't get more cashiers but... It's still a valid complaint.

In regards to Linda P., there are many other places open after 9PM, such as Fry's and Safeway. Fry's opens back up at 4PM as well.Often the little hole in the wall restaurants have some of the best food.  That is not the case here.  And it smells funny.  Not funny ha-ha, funny raw meat, slaughter house funny.

The tamales were nothing special and they too smelled funny.  I'm sure there is better Mexican food to be found in Casa Grande.  That doesn't smell funny.  Ha-ha or strange.Sometimes when you're driving to or from Tucson, you must stop by the I-10 Del Harris aka Del Taco.  Unfortunately, this one takes the cake for "what the heck is going on here?" I've been here a couple times, and every time I order something, they have me pull up to a parking spot and wait for Christmas before bringing the food out?!?  Excuse me?  This occurs even if I'm the only one in the drive through.  Del Taco, send some execs, and get this joint straightened out!  It gets 2 stars because Macho Fries soothes the soul.You walk in, and it smells just like Lee-Lee Market. There is outdated furniture and decor.  There is a constant Din of Vietnamese being spoken in the back and front of house. The menu is covered in things that you cannot pronounce and quite frankly have no idea what they are.  There is something called "Squid Sauce" on the table.  This place has got to kick some serious ass right? NO! No. It does not have to. 

Enough already. Just Stop it.  Just because some place has a weird vibe and seams out of this world does not mean that it is amazing or even good. It means that you should give it a fair shake just like everything else.  When you look past the glamor of being unglamorous you soon realize that this place is mediocre at best.

I had the Chicken in Lemon Grass sauce and you know what? It was edible.  And I ate it.   I also had the Thai Iced tea and I drank it as well. But that was it. Nothing more and nothing less.  I  know when something tastes good and I refuse to chalk this one up to being an unsophisticated dolt (In reality, I am am exactly that, but my tongue and tummy do not know me very well. So let's keep this between us).

I have done it a thousand times before.  "Well, this place is really foreign and weird, so let's go there and be hip!" Well today I draw a line in the sand and make a stand.  

Here is the beginning of my food manifesto!
1.Good food is universal. If something does not taste good, it does not taste good.

 And...Hmm...Well... That got off to a good start and then lost steam after my first demand.  Well, Ted Kaczynski I am not.Gross.  Typical greasy, low quality Mexican food.  If it's all you can afford Buon Appetite.again, if it sounds too good to be true, (all you can eat sushi) then it's probably too good to be true (AYCE sushi).

so some of you are probably saying, "....he just ate at another AYCE sushi place and was so disappointed, fool you once shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me".  we've been living in chandler for 3.5 yrs and we've never even heard of this place.

lesson learned:  never eat at a sushi place that doesn't come with high recommendations from people you have eaten with and trust their palates.

there's a semi-rational reason that other places charge $8-$13 a roll.  if they charge you that much and the sushi is sucky, then you would be the one making a scene at the cash register.

what's the deal w/japanese food being inherently expensive?  they sell us great cars and really do it to us on the food.  show me a japanese restaurant where you can get out the door for less than $15/head and i'll show you kyoto bowl (see review)

for half the price, you can get twice as much food at an authentic chinese restaurant and have a ton of leftovers.  but i guess you can't get chinese cooks to cook it in front of you while catching shrimp in their hats.

go figure

i was amazed that when we went there on a friday night, the place was standing room only (but we were the only people of asian persuasian)    .  i get the impression that the staff is trying to save money (more tips for the 2 waitresses?) because they seemed to be falling all over each other like keystone cops, wizzing past our tables and avoiding eye contact whenever we needed an extra pair of chopstix, napkins or water refills.

am i being the the overly cautious 1st time parent or what?  the waitress brings out the scalding hot soup and passes it right over the head of our 1 y/o daughter sitting in her high chair and plops it down within arms reach of her.  we quickly move it to the adult who ordered it (brilliant).

we were sitting with my friend's 20 or so family members and requested a separate check to ease the confusion.  she stuttered and stammered and said that she was not allowed to do that and that we would have to be on the same check (i guess we had to sit at a separate table to get a separate tab?)  i could see how 18 on 1 tab and 2 on another would be confusing.

my wife ordered the tempura soba noodle soup and said that it was so salty that her tongue is now preserved for life.  i ordered the chicken katsu which was decent, but the sauce was almost like biscuits and gravy style sauce.

if you're on a budget and just wanna stuff your face with low-grade sushi and walk away full, then this is the place.  if you want quality, great tasting sushi, then you'll have to pay the piper.

you have been forewarnedI guess I'm just spoiled. This is like the fast food of eye doctors. If you go to fast food you shouldn't expect sit down service. So it goes here. The staff are standing around  and my appointment was an hour ago. We have been sitting and sitting. Meanwhile the kids movie that was playing in the VCR/TV combo just finished and I've been listening to the snowy white noise for 10 mins. My well-behaved 11 year old son has been patiently waiting with his sunglasses on. Don't come here if you are expecting prompt and personable service.This place is FAR away! We came here to pick our own produce. The place was swarming with weeds! They said that it was because of the recent rains, but come on!

We did get some great beets, and we walked around the large farm. It was quite dead while we were there (a Thursday in March), but we know there can be a lot going on here during festivals, etc. The animals were fun to look at, but I think some of them needed grooming. They were way too hot being outside!

All in all, we would not come back here again except to maybe try out the festivals (Peach Festival maybe).Ate here recently with a large group.  While we appreciated that they had the capacity to serve our group, the service could have been better.  My sandwich was incorrectly placed on someone else's plate, and the server just put it on a different plate, added the salad and gave it to me.  The other  person in our group had already touched it, so I wasn't thrilled that it was given to me at that point.  While the sandwich tasted fine, I had a hard time getting past that.  In the end, I placed cash in the presenter and waited for some time for my change, which never came.  Because we were in a hurry, I didn't bother waiting around.  Probably won't return.This store is right near our house, so I run in often.  It's pretty lacking in the features of a grocery store:

- service is terrible - the cashiers are super slow, confused and sometimes disheveled.  
- the self-checkout machines have an issue just about every time.  i use these everywhere i can, typically with great success....and the attendant is usually nowhere to be found.  When they finally arrive, they're confused and slow.  
- the selection is paltry - they have pretty obvious things but don't expect many brand choices, options, etc.
- the prices are a bit steep, compared to bigger, nicer stores, plus they don't seem to have a lot of sale items
- the produce is pretty terrible.  the guy who works in that department will cheerfully help you pick a pineapple, though.

In summary, if you don't live just down the street, avoid this place.Its a salad buffet....thats it! It's boring.  It's clean, good service, but its not exciting.If you go there during lunch time, the place is usually packed but the food is fresh and good. If you go for dinner, the place is empty and the food tastes like is prepared ahead of time.I went here for lunch and spent $9.30 for a regular soda and a hot chicken parmasean sandwich. The meal was served with a small bag of chips. I was underwhelmed by the presentation and taste of the sandwich. I'm used to the bread being toasted. So the only part of the sandwich that was heated was the chicken and sauce. I left this place hungry and disappointed by the taste of the sandwich as well. Maybe this place should just stick to the deli side of the business.Checked this place out today for lunch as a possible spot to watch NFL games. Took advantage of their lunch menu and got the sliders. I get my bill and $2.50 is added to my bill for a beverage.  I was drinking water. Apparently, you have to buy a drink to take advantage of the lunch specials. I was not informed of this and was pissed. On top of that the sliders were mediocre at best.  These specials that have these restrictions drive me crazy. A heads from the bartender about the beverage deal would have been nice. When I questioned the bill, the original bartender who took my drink order said, "she didn't tell you?" I'm not going back to this place.Went here last night for our first night in Scottsdale for our anniversary. We like to go to places that you can tell are not chains. This was definitely a special place. Very kitschy and a little dated but has personality. We found out our waiter was also part owner (father/son partnership). He was a delight. Loved his sense of humor. One of our favorite parts of this restaurant.  He recommended a few great meal options. We started with the calamari sauteed with tomato and garlic. The sauce was so tasty but very spicy. Our mouths were burning but we kept digging in soaking up our bread in the great fresh flavors. My husband got the spaghetti bolignese and I got the ravioli trio (lobster, butternut squash and cheese) with three different sauces. I though the butternut ravioli would have been best with the sage butter and the lobster with the cream. Although didnt taste a "lobster" and the sage butter had a slightly strange taste. Both meals were good. We have our favorite Italian we are comparing it to so it only got a three as the flavors were tasty but not something we'd crave to have again. We maybe given it 4 stars also if each dish wasn't $21. We felt it was a bit pricy.I mean, it's Taco Bell. Not much to say.
This building is very outdated, definitely needs an update. The food is alright, I haven't had any issues with the ordering. They aren't very busy though, so I think the workers could be nicer.Extremely avg to below.
People - we have so many Mexican food options that you should not consider this one. Just to say something positive - if this were in BF Wisconsin they'd love it.Bad:  Would not let us use the aerobics room to do our exercises, despite the fact that it was empty.  They cited liability reasons -- reason that were completely illogical to me.  Also, cleaning lady did not clean coffee machine or replace coffee, mugs, or condiments.  Restaurants were very pricey.

Good: Nice pools and slide. Nice live music.Bleh, cold egg sandwich for breakfast?  Whose idea was this, to make a COLD egg breakfast sandwich?

Anyway, seems like a bunch of kids run this place.  Was rather clean though, with decent parking, but man that breakfast is lame.Not impressed at all....Staff was not friendly or engaging.  If they had been, I might have been more inclined to pick something up...Had lots of bras on clearance though.I love me some Sweet Tomatoes. The fact that I can build my own salad of whatever the heck I want without having to deal with a menu choice is fantastic. And I love all the soup options, bread, pasta and ice cream as well.

The Sweet Tomatoes on Southern and McClintock though is terrible. It used to be a regular ST, but it closed and opened as the Field Kitchen experiment. I never went there when it was like that, but I heard it was bad.

The reopening of this location with the promise that they are "just like every other Sweet Tomatoes" out there is so untrue. First of all, the whole place reeks of rosemary from the chicken they grill at the end of the salad line. It's super overwhelming. Second, the options in the salad bar aren't marked (so you get to guess what you're dumping on your plate) and they don't have nearly as many options as other locations.

The layout is horrendous as well. To get to the soups, pastas and breads, you have to walk through the line that is inevitably standing at the ice cream machine. Which is in competition with the line at the soda machine - because there isn't enough room for everyone to get around. And put in more than one soda machine for crying out loud! Especially when the ice takes freaking forever to dispense.

I will continue to go to Sweet Tomatoes, but definitely not this one. I'll drive out of my way to go to one that I know is real and still good.Ahh, nothing beats the scent of body odor, cigarette smoke, and beer on a beautiful Sunday afternoon at Walmart. Hey, we can get these free smells at almost any Walmart. 

Once you have been to one Walmart you have been to them all. Cheap prices and everything you could ever want to purchase all in one place! Rock on! 

Having said that, this Walmart's layout is pretty bad. Everything is scattered around the store, and it is so hard to find what your looking for. I think they want you to wander around aimlessly with no sense of direction. Of coarse the only people who actually work at Walmart are the cashiers, so good luck finding someone to point you in the direction of the hand soap section. 

Sadly, there are other Walmart locations that are better. (Did I just say that?)I always find what I need but the customer service could be better. It is hard to find anyone to help out with questions. I recently purchased a new computer chair and was looking for someone to help out with getting the box to the front of the store. I had to go to the front of the store to ask for help.  I asked for a cart or a dolly to help me get it to the front of the store. The associate was more than helpful though and carried the box to the front and then out to my car. I just wish it would have been easier to find employees walking around the store ensuring that their customers were alright.The prices are good and they do a nice job cleaning but I'm pretty sure that they don't press anything, although I did see a clothes press when I was there.  Maybe it was decoration?  Plus side, they can have your items done the same day if you bring them in early enough.

I would go back but with the expectation that I will have to put my iron to use.I got a 3.99 meal coupon at work so decided to try Souper Salad.  Basic salad bar with some fruit and cold pasta salads, 4 soups, 1 pizza choice, 2 hot pastas, ground beef tacos, 3 dessert breads, and a soft serve machine.  Everything was pretty simple and bland tasting.  Maybe I'm just too spoiled by Sweet Tomatoes.  But who am I to complain! I only paid 3.99.

(I think this is a great place if you have several little ones to feed though. It's cheap, with a coupon, and they will like the "kid friendly" healthy food.)I frequent the bell and dysart locations and  this was the first time it was "eh". The Bigfoot chicken fried steak and eggs are always large and more than enough. The gravy this time seemed watery and the toast was half burnt and half bread. The other meal of a bacon and cheese stuffed burger looked awesome but we had to return because it was requested with no onion. The replacement was nothing more than a regular burger with bacon and cheese. The bear claws which are usually nice and hot was cold and was missing its butter, and some bites felt like I was chewing dough. It was busy on a Friday night and the place seemed understaffed. After wards when most of the dinner rush was over our waitress barely made any rounds to check up on us and did not get one single refill for our soda and tea. They were nice to remove my date's burger from the bill. Because of our frequent dine ins and our bear rewards card the bill came to 40 cents. If you go to this place and want good service you will have to wait that weekend morning for about 45 minutes when the star employees are working.This club was really creepy. 

Aside from the impressive two story set-up with pool tables and  loungey space upstairs, I was not impressed. Our group was really out-of-place. Our ladies weren't dressed sleazy or tacky enough with cheapy slutty clothing. And our guys weren't dressed generically enough (think black/white mall-wear). Drinks were much weaker than the previous establishment we went to (Fox and Hound).

Ahh, the things I will do for friends. Going to Mc Duffy's for a friend's birthday night out is one of those gestures. My McDuffy's good deed has me off the hook for another year I suppose. I was actually having more fun at Fox and Hound and wish we had stayed there.

An extra star for the doorman knowing one of the girls in the group, letting the guys in our group bypass the $10 cover. $10 too much in my opinion.Trader Joe's is a staple stop on our weekly grocery route. We love many things about this store and have become nearly dependent on many items. I have very little to say about TJ's that is negative but I feel that what there is that is negative must be written.

Just like there are many things we come to this location to purchase, there are items here we have learned to avoid. These items are mainly in the meat department and most notably the poultry. We have purchased chicken in many forms that have been dated as fresh only to get them home and find them stinky and not fit to eat. We have purchased whole chickens, breast strips among others and are frequently not fresh. Last year we bought our Thanksgiving turkey here only to have it be spoiled with 4 days of shelf life left. So ultimately we have stopped purchasing poultry here.

However, we have found one product in the meat department we love, the wild caught salmon. We like that it is not farm raised and have only had two occasions this product was not fresh. 

Every time an event like this happens the management at the store is apologetic and refunds our money which is great but is it a satisfactory solution? For a store that is in the business of selling food I find their inability to manage product freshness at about a two star level.

While there are many things we like about Trader Joe's I feel that any company is only as good as their worst attribute. We have stopped buying many of the meats here. Maybe it is just this location that has trouble keeping their meats fresh. 

This review really only applies to the meat department. If this department was on it's "A" game I would probably give a lot more stars!There is a wonderful selection of items available at this conveniently located store.  Much of the clutter has been removed making the entryway far more accesible.  Good changes.

Unfortunately, the item I stopped by for, while available, was not priced.  The display was prominent,  and the multi - packs of prepared canvases were present.  The products that did have a price associated with them were the drawing table and table top easel.  Lovely.  The canvas packs?  No discernable prices.

Looking for someone to help me was a frustrating experience.   No one seemed available except the cashier, and I was not prepared to wait in THAT line.

Having a great selection of products is nice.  If I cannot purchase them, you might as well close your doors.I am becoming less and less fond of Anthem Pediatrics, and their billing/records department.

My daughter was born on 12/31/12, I had not picked a pediatrician, and Dr. Vu was the pediatrician on call that night at St. Rose hospital. He was friendly, informative, and my husband liked him. I decided on him for our pediatrician.
I do agree that the doctors there are pretty illusive, and I have seen the nurse more than I have seen Dr. Vu himself.

But, on to my annoyance with their billing department. Today, 7/25/13, I get a bill from them for $350. For the dates 12/31 and 1/1.... yes, seven months ago, from when we were in the hospital.

They have been submitting this to my insurance, and every time they do, I get notice from my insurance. AND EVERY TIME, my insurance tells me that I owe them, the provider $0.00.

The insurance has also stated that appropriate codes need to be submitted.
Now, my insurance covered my birth, and my daughter's first two days of life.

I have written a letter that will be sent out tomorrow 7/26/13 telling Anthem Pediatrics that I will not be paying this bill until I get denial from my insurance company.  At this time, I feel that I have no other choice but to withdraw my daughter from the care of Anthem Pediatrics and Dr. Vu. I have asked for her records to be released.

I see here a parent that says that her and her husband don't have insurance, and pay $55 for an office visit. I find it funny that we are in the same boat, and we pay *******$100****** every time we step into that office!

8/31/2013
Still NO RESPONSE FROM ANTHEM PEDIATRICS.
Still don't have my daughter's records.

9/12/13
I get a phone call from a "Kerri", who works at the rainbow office. She says that my insurance, has given them denial over the phone. Sooo....she has denial, but I don't...? I will handle that with my insurance company.

Kerri says that they would send me a discounted bill, along with the woman from the insurance representative that she spoke with.

9/20/13
I receive the updated invoice from Anthem Pediatrics,
***but no name of the insurance rep. that Kerri spoke to, 
**or my daughter's records.

10/2/13
I finally have my daughter's records, after two months (asked on 7/26/13) ......Seriously.I love the food at this place but the service definitely sucks! We got here before a large group came in. We got seated, but the server took orders from the larger group first. Come on, we got here first. We waited for another 10 mins but still nobody came to us. We don't even have anything on our table. The other server didn't even care, he started to clean the other table. We got pissed because we are so hungry and we didn't even got serve at all. We finally left. Now, I don't know if I will come back at this place. But If I do, I want better service.I have been here a lot, and i have eaten pretty much every menu. 

well, food here is kinda like something that i used to cook when I was a college student. I mean, it's fun, but it doesn't taste that well. I think the quality of sushi here is the same as what you get at Vegas's all-you-can-eat sushi places. 

Service isn't professional, either. I guess they are students from college. One time this young chef was trying to get my gf's phone number while I was in the bathroom. WTF! This ain't a college dorm, dude.

So, this totally makes sense - this is a restaurant run by college students. Actually, this is why I keep going here. Atmosphere! Not for food. If I wanna eat beef tataki, I go to Blue Ribbon at the Cosmo. If I wanna eat oysters, I go to Joes at the Ceaser's palace. If I wanna eat sushi, I NEVER go to Ichiza simply because fish here sucks! 

However, if I wanna simply have fun and get wasted by not spending too much money, I go to Ichiza. Overall quality is pretty fuckin crappy, but for that reason i keep going.

Definitely not for rich businessmen and lawyers.

Btw, when it is jammed like on weekends, your server might be pissed if you stay too long. I saw the manager was asking a waitress to kick customers out as soon as they finish eating and drinking. I even saw the (kinda old dude) manager was kicking this drunk hobo wondering outside the restaurant. Not good. Kicking is a crime! What a kangfu restaurant it is!!I usually am happy about the work from us nails, but this time I'm pissed. There are specks in my black tips.. The lady tried covering it up with a Rhine stone so it couldn't be seen. I told her no. They hardly speak English. The place is dirty. The woman doing my nails was on the phone 75% of the time, then left me for 20 minutes to do a woman's eye brows. Getting my nails done hurt, and they aren't supposed to.. I mean, my nails aren't even the same length. Pissed. I am pissed.Blueberry Hill makes me laugh because of a conversation my friend once heard between a man and two...uh...ladies of the evening that were seated behind her at 2 AM at one of their fine dining establishments.

"Girl, your breath smells like goat MEAT!" said the man, to which one of the women retorted, "I'm gonna punch you in the NECK!"

That secondhand exchange is why Blueberry Hill gets 2 stars, otherwise it would be 1.  Dingy and with poor service, not even their limp, 'specialty' pancakes can make up for the horridness of the rest of their menu.  Take me to Denny's, please!everyone at pair-a-dice does fantasic work. ive gotten three piercings and two tattoos from jesse. the work was amazing. eveything healed up well and looks great. im always getting compliments.  however, at my last visit to see him to get mine at my friends septums pierced, things were slightly uncomfortable. while paying for my services, he smacked my ass and said some sexual comments. i dont think ill ever return, which saddens me becuase the artwork is top notch. but i DO NOT reccomend young ladies visit him alone. but other than that its a nice place. everyone else is incredibly professional and welcomingThe service is good with very high internet speeds. Cable TV is high quality also. The prices however are RIDICULOUS.....the price HIKES all the time make me want to lose my lunchOnly come here on Tuesdays! Two pieces (leg and thigh) for just 99 cents! Service is VERY slow even if they are not busy! If they are busy, then you better bring a book along with you or a full battery on your phone to pass the time! 

IF they dont mess up your order then it usually is worth the wait. But you would think the wait would be quick since you can see all of the chicken that is cooked right in front of you! 

So in conclusion, Church's Chicken (kitty corner to these guys) is slightly better servicewise. Don't get me wrong. I like both these chicken places but sometimes, good service goes a long way.First, I never do this unless it is absolutely necessary and it would be irresponsible not to. DO NOT ACCEPT THEIR MAGAZINE PROMOTION. The cashier made it sound like I wouldn't pay anything until I respond to a mailing I would be receiving. This makes sense since the magazine company needs to acquire a payment method...correct? NOPE.  Ulta slides your credit card and gives it directly to the magazine companies, and if you don't respond then they automatically charge you assuming no new is good news.  Luckily the customer service rep at the magazine company took care of me and refunded me... at least that's what he said and we will see.Robertos was on my food list for my October trip.  I tried it and well, meh.

First, let me say I like the set up of the serve yourself salsa bar.  I like that they have three kinds of salsa and that lovely melange of spicy carrots and onions .  That was the highlight.  The food left me disappointed.  I ordered:

1. 3 Rolled Chicken Tacos- they were the skinniest, hardest, blandest things I tried to eat.  I had them add guac to go on top.  I stopped after eating one and a half.  They were sad.  And that "guac"?  Someone ought to be arrested selling that as guac.  It was like eating sour cream with green food coloring.  
2.  Steak Tacos - I have never had steak tacos so bland.  I doused them with the tomatillo sauce giving it much needed help.

The only thing that tasted fresh and was hot?

3.  Cheese Quesadilla - imagine that.  A simple quesadilla was the only thing I finished and enjoyed.

If I could make a meal from cheese quesadillas and the salsa bar, I'll be back.Not a great variety of food. A majority of the people that dine here are the elderly. The menu outside is just sad. Resorting to listing sauces/gravy/rice as food items to take up space should be a sign. The main ethnic food here is Mexican followed by Chinese. I just stuck with the Chinese food, which isn't great at all. The deep-fried pork pot stickers are the closest thing to authentic. Beware, prime rib is an additional cost! The hot meats available were baked ham and roast beef. The roast beef wasn't too shabby and the ham was sort of acceptable. Desserts are the generic cakes. Lots of sugar-free options. i decided to try the rainbow sherbet ice cream. The lady scooped me 3 scoops of it and by the time I was back at the table, a layer of liquid has already emerged at the bottom of the bowl. Melted ice cream is gross, but tasted ok. 

Service was slow. I had to get beverage refills constantly myself. Good thing the machine was steps away from the table. Restrooms are located outside of the buffet behind where the cocktails are served inside the buffet (hope that makes some sense).This used to be my go to for all things chinese food but unfortunately this place has really fallen apart.  I went here a few months ago and waited 1 1/2 hours for my food to come out (which it never did).  After 2 hours i got up, told the server who said "sorry you just came at bad time" and I left in absolute disgust.

Service: There is none.   All the servers aren't kind at all anymore and I don't feel like a guest.  They treat people like second class citizens instead of welcoming them into their restaurant and ensuring quality experience.

Food: Took forever and wasn't able to try it since it never came out.

*No more discount after 10pm :(

Overall: I won't be coming back.  Chinatown is lined up with chinese restaurants and i found my new go to which will be in my next review so stay tuned!The place is under construction so VERY limited seating.  Was very cold inside.  Very dark lighting as most fixtures were missing.  holes in ceiling and walls torn apart.  Some guy at the bar in camouflage seated us and took waitress almost 10 minutes to greet us.  There was only one other couple in the place.  Food wasn't terrible but lacked flavor.  Decent prices but the Greek music was competing with the country radio station that was blaring in the bar area.  Was just really weird!!!!!Grade: C-

Good food except you have to order it at the "food counter" and bring it to yourself. Very lame concept.This will do, but only because it is one of the three Korean restaurants in all of Madison. 

The tofu soup that I ordered was...lacking, to say the least. For $10, I expected a decent assortment of seafood and other ingredients in my soup, but I guess I set my expectations too high. I've had my fair share of tofu soups on both coasts, and the New Seoul tofu soup didn't even come close to the most basic of tofu soups I've had. The flavor of the soup itself was pretty good. Not what I'm used to, but still acceptable. My major gripe was with the lack of anything other than tofu in my soup. 

The banchan was below average as well. We had three different side dishes: the fried sweet potato, kimchi, and some sort of pickled radish. Nothing really stood out, and nothing seemed to have required a significant amount of thought or preparation. For a family-owned restaurant, it seemed odd that they didn't try to serve something more authentic or more 'homemade' to really get that home-cooked feel. 

I think the only thing worth ordering at New Seoul would be the bibimbap, whether you get it in a regular or stone bowl. The portions are large and it comes served with a side of miso soup. There is definitely enough food for two meals - unless you are my friend. He inhaled the bibimbap like there was no tomorrow.American TV is now out of business. Is it wrong to dance on their grave? A couple years ago they sold me a glider chair which was preposterously fragile. They wouldn't return it and I was an unsatisfied customer. I never returned. Apparently I wasn't the only one.Disappointed. My friends had the deep dish pizza and said it was not as thick and delicious as the one they had at Uno's in Chicago. The salad they ordered was mediocre, nothing special. I had the 5 grain thin pizza with eggplant spinach and tomato, which was okay. The most memorable part of the meal was observing our waiter who kept a dead-pan expression and lumbered slowly back and forth from the dining room to the kitchen. He only provided silverware for the salad eaters, not for those with pizza who might like to eat ingredients that fell off the pizza onto the plate. Shouldn't have to wait and request eating utensils. We all agreed we would not return.Not too busy on a Saturday late-morning for breakfast and football. Breakfast portions are inexpensive and large. My farmer's omelet had a sufficient amount of toppings, but was just ok. Friends had the bacon and said it was cooked very well. 

The bloody mary was ok. Free jello shots when the Badgers score a touch down! Plenty of space for large parties. An ok place for a cheap breakfast, but don't expect it to be quick. The service was slow and shotty at best.Just returning from seeing "wait, wait, don't tell me" live radio show. The show was fantastic and once in our seats, the view was great (even in the nosebleeds) and acoustics were fantastic. 

But getting into the theater was more like wait, wait and then wait some more.  I was horrified at how completely unprepared they appeared to be to handle a sell out crowd. We initially waited in a line for will call that didn't move for 5-10 minutes at all. Then eventually started snail pacing along. Getting into the theater itself was a confusing cluster-mess of snaking lines leading every which way.  Once in the theater there was no one directing anyone anywhere. It was a mess. I was so unimpressed with the entrance, it is a good thing the actual show made up for the first impression. Not a venue I'm likely to return to anytime soon.Under-par for even a hotel bar. 1.7 stars

Cost to worth it rating: 1 (martinis for $12 and not a bartender talent level or atmosphere to support it)

Highlights:
- Convenient: if you're staying in the hotel
- Outdoor seating: patio area with misters if you want to be outdoors or have someone who wants to smoke
- Indoor seating: long bar and some tables and couches
- Vodkas: have level as well as Ciroc, Effen, and some flavored options
- White cosmo: ok, not too sweet

Lowlights:
- Service: didn't get paid attention to for a while and long lag between getting drinks that we ordered
- Snacks: sub-par wings and even chips and salsa left a lot to be desired--bland
- Shot prices: $10 each for mixed shot
- Hours: last call at midnight on a Saturday night

Won't be back unless I'm needing a drink and too lazy to leave the hotel.As you know,  i'm spoiled by living in the Bay Area and Tokyo.
I've had amazing food and its not always expensive, usually not.
I just expect quality and care in any dish.

I was craving Thai food and went to Thai Rama  on a recommendation based on dinner my sister had there 3 years ago.
I always order Thai Beef Salad at a new Thai spot...sort of a litmus test.
It wasn't my favorite. 

Loads of onions, no tomato and no cucumber and no mint.
The spice level was nice, good flavor.
The beef was way over cooked and far from the medium rare juicy I expect.

I'm not sure I will be backMontevida was a decent place to live for the year we were there. It became more inconvenient to get in and out as the light rail construction ramped up. The office staff had a "Can I help you?" type of attitude as soon as the lease was signed as oppose to the "How may I help?" they treat you with when trying to lure you in. The maintenance was okay. They usually had a quick fix approach as oppose to fully solving the problem. The apartment layout was nice and unique, spacious closets, nice bathroom. 

My BIGGEST complaint was how they advised me to have the carpet professionally cleaned when we moved out, so that they would not include this as deduction from our security deposit refund.  After turning it a signed receipt from the cleaning company (as requested), they have failed to remove this as deduction. After multiple visits and six months later, they have failed to refund this.We had a horrible experience several weeks ago.  I ordered 14-ounce Rib Eye dinner.... what I got what looked just like my dinner companion's steak in the 8-oz sirloin/(shrimp) dinner. A 14-oz Rib Eye is obviously a good-size steak. They tried to say it just shrunk.  The second Rib Eye was not much better perhaps 10-11-oz. But the worst part was that the second steak was so grizzly that it was mostly inedible. I actually took pictures of it just in case Outback HQ was interested. No reply from email to their customer service. What a disgrace all the way around. 

I have eaten at Outback Steakhouses all over the US on business for many, many years.... Lately, they have gone progressively "down hill" in quality and service.  This particular place was empty on a Saturday night... always a good sign to stay away.

While the manager did remove the charge from our bill, the dinner was a bad experience. I can only guess that Outback provides the quality of meat from their corporate level.  We ended up buying nice steaks from a local market the next day and cooking them ourselves at home.

If we wish to have road-kill we can certainly find lots of cheap horrible cuts of steak in the local discount stores.

Outback should be ashamed.

Be warned....This place has been here for EVERRRR It's behind the Big O Tires in the same parking lot as a bunch of car shops. This was the original "Raider" bar of N. PHX. for over 10 years I guess its under new ownership now and the new owner ousted the Raider Club. Ouch this place used to be packed!! I haven't been here in awhile, well since I had a kegerator and with these bad times I found myself here again last night for a bit while the Fiesta Bowl was on. You would think with sports on that people would be here but the parking lot was pretty empty. It was about 8-ish and the bar was quite bare with only a handful of patrons sitting at the bar possibly just for the barbie bartender behind the counter in a tight corset. It was just my brother and I but we didnt get greeted upon entering or feel welcome so much. They only had Bud, Bud Light and Amber Bock on tap and what looked like a decent selection of bottled beer. The staff wasn't overly friendly or attentive to us with my brother practically having to beg to buy another round.

The atmosphere was just pretty blah all around. The projection screen looks to be the same old one and is in dyer need of being replaced. The flat screens above the bar are nice but thats about it. One more good note looks like they put in a smoking patio that seems new and some fresh paint outside to green and white. Used to be Silver & Black I guess this place really wants to set itself apart from those crazy Raider fans. 

I didnt make it upstairs  to have a look around (they used to have pool tables) but most of the furniture looked to be the same nothing special or new. This used to be such a great place full of energy and happy people. We left feeling neglected and spent the rest of our money on scratcher tickets at the liquor store where they like us. I don't want to believe this bar is THAT bad so I plan on returning on a busier night, to give it another go and hopefully update with more stars??I've been here and had great service. But honestly , we're still in a bad economy.  The service was bad. They have these tokens by the door and I saw the guy behind the counter give it to someone. So I asked , "what's that for?". He ignored me. I asked again clearly and a bit louder , ignored me again. There are a lot of people who need jobs right now and the people getting hired are rude. I tweeted them that next time I'll just use iTunes. and I will. Your new albums are priced just as much , if not higher , than what I'd be paying for a download on iTunes ,  amazon mp3 , or other big brand stores. And yes this is a real review. I was there today , a beatles poster and a copy of a 3d only version of "Avatar" were purchased. A copy of sherlock holmes was purchased , but then exchanged unopened for avatar.Chuck E Cheese is our typical Friday outing.  We had an activity in south Phoenix so on our way home we stopped at the closest one.  This was our first time at the one.  The good thing is they had different machines then the other ones we go to.  But the one thing my daughter loves about Chuck E Cheese is "Chuck E Cheese". At this one I almost had to become Chuck E myself, we almost had to force them to bring Chuck E out. We got there at 5pm, we were about to leave and they finally brought him out.  So we she did get to see him but almost by force.Went on Saturday for lunch and the dining area was not to busy. Their was on server who managed all the tables. Since she was the only server the drink order took about 5 minuets after we arrived. My rating is based off of food quality. I ordered the Large New England Clam Chowder for 4.95, not badly priced, however I have had better canned chowder. very salty and WAY to much butter. Also the temperature for the soup was warm not hot, which probably means it was microwaved/ re-heated. We also ordered cheese sticks and calamari. They did look good when they cam out however, both dishes were under cooked and had to be sent back. Who wants soft calamari and cheese sticks? After the food was brought back to our table, the items still were not crsipy, whatever. the flavor of the breading on the calamari and cheese sticks was so bland and the marinara sauce was sub-par. Unfortunately i would not go back the Chowder house, rather go to Red Lobster!We were in downtown Mesa and decide to try this place based on Yelp reviews. We were not impressed. The place is sparsely decorated, concrete floors with picnic furniture and zero charm. The food was less than impressive, their coffee was a fast-food -watered-down-medium-to-light-blend and their cookies were average. There was nothing about this place that I would come back for. However, to their credit, the lady behind the counter was bubbly and sweet.I was excited about a close New Mexican style Mexican restaurant close to home. 

Sadly the food was less than average. How disappointing. 

The kitchen clearly does not understand how to make an enchilada. The chicken was poached and in large chunks and very dry. The dish had less than 1/2 a teaspoon of green sauce. 

Try shredding the chicken and soaking it in broth to make it tender. 

The service was ok. And the atmosphere was good. Too bad the food was mediocre. 

I would be hard pressed to return. Reviews all say great things, but clearly there is room for vast improvement.I usually get on here for positive reviews but this is not one of those.  I was quoted over a thousand dollars of repairs on a car that  I baby every month.  I was concerned but got a little work done and then had over $600 left of repairs to do when I left.  While driving away, I noticed that my car drove worse when I left.  A few days later they called and asked me when I was coming in to get my brakes done since they were on their last leg, according to Thompsons.

I held off and got a second opinion.   I brought it to Sunland Auto on Val Vista and Broadway.  Bob was a huge help and also showed me that my brakes had 50-60% pad left still and were fine.  I felt very deceived by Thompsons.  Not only that, but ther work that needed to get done was only going to cost me a quarter of what Thompsons quoted me.   Over all, I saved more than $400 dollars by using Sunland on Broadway and Val Vista and my car drives amazingly.   I am in great hands with Bob, Chuck, and their team.Lutheran thrift was supposed to pick up a couch from me yesterday. Never called & never showed up. It was so much fun moving that heavy couch outside yesterday morning that they never picked up. Yep. FUN. Pffft.I was craving donuts, and decided to stop in for a couple. The woman helping me seemed miserable. I ordered one chocolate frosted, and one vanilla frosted. They were both put in a bag on their side without any paper which caused most of the icing to come off onto the bag. The donuts are delicious, but they lack customer service.Orange Table? I almost gave you three stars because of that superb BLT, but I can't say honestly that everything was A-okay. My kids loved their grilled cheese - it looked a little intimidating what with that thick and oh-so nicely toasted bread, but really - the kiddies devoured them and felt satisfied.

The service, however, is not so great. Yeah. We waited a long time for you guys to get your act together and think about how to put the tables together for us. And it was crowded - so for awhile I gave you a break on that. But then it wasn't crowded and the tables didn't get moved and we didn't get seated and you all were standing around the counter pretty much not doing anything - not even slinging any attitude. This kind of service seems consistent with the other reviews I've read, so I gather maybe you're holding yourself to a different standard and that's fine. But to be honest now - I've experienced hipper and ruder waitstaff and you'll just have to dig a little deeper if that's the niche you're going for, 'k?I danced my ass off one night here!  Had a blast, but thank god I didn't have to pay for the drinks!  Somehow we got passed the cover at the door too.  The decor is really posh/random.  I don't remember much, but I know it didn't suck BUT I'm pretty sure that's because the people I was with were awesome... not the place.The ice cream here is delicious, but the service is horrendous. There always seems to be 10+ people working here, yet they often seemed annoyed to have patrons. 

This place is adorable, and has deep roots in old Az. Come on, Sugar Bowl, step it up a little.When I heard about Cowboy Ciao I was excited to try it. The food sounds so interesting and flavorful. 
We wanted to try as many dishes as possible, and they were such extremes. We started with the Calamari as we do every place we go. It was not great; the calamari itself was okay, nothing amazing, just okay. The sauce it came with was not good and the combination of the sauce and the calamari was downright gross.
Then we tried the Mushroom dish, and it was really good. So flavorful and really rich. I wish I had bread so we could eat the sauce. Highly recommended.
The third dish was the Tiger Shrimp with grits (I think) The shrimp were good, but they used Pace Picante Sauce with the grits and it was disgusting! I wish I was kidding about the Pace, but honestly if I went into the kitchen I bet I would find a jar...
The fourth dish we tried was the Spare Ribs, and these were really good, I would recommend these as well.
The dessert, Peanut Butter and Chocolate Brownie, was not impressive and could have lived without.
The roller coaster that was our meal was not what I would have expected for the price we paid and I probably won't go back. This is why I gave it 2 stars.
Sorry guys, but maybe you should re-look at some of your dishes...and the prices as well. Is it because it is Scottsdale that they can charge whatever ridiculous price you want?I agree with many of the other reviews.  The NO CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED is a bit ridiculous in this day.  It was WAY overpriced.  The menu selections were really limited, I mean it IS a Pancake House, but there was nothing spectacular about it.  I had the spinach and mushroom crepe.  The crepe part was OK, but the filling tasted like previously frozen cooked-spinach mixed with cream of mushroom soup.  They  gave me a little extra bowl of ICE COLD mushroom soup (which they called sauce) on the plate along side of 3 crepes.  Bland, Bland, Bland......
The waitress was OK, but the hostess was pretty "in your face" about the CASH only policy and rudely pointed me to the ATM behind me.   I was able to pull together the cash, without using the ATM, so really no big deal. Would I visit again? No.  Sad, because I thought it would be fun for my kids.Let's start with the positive, which begins about an hour after we sat in the bar area - the Big Ass Burger is big and delicious.  Now to the rest:

We ordered the Green Chile Pork appetizer after asking our waiter to help us decide between that and the guacamole and queso.  We take our time ordering dinner because we have an appetizer coming - except that we don't.  When it becomes clear it isn't arriving we start eyeing the kitchen for signs of our dinner.  

Our meal shows up much later than our leisurely ordering would have dictated and we advise our waiter not to bring the Green Chile Pork. He responds "You didn't get that?"  I was thinking, "you helped us order it but you didn't bring it, you didn't arrange for it to be brought, and you certainly didn't clear it from our table prior to serving our entrees and still you seem surprised."  But because I am on a sarcasm control regimen I just said, "No, we didn't."

Two of us ordered fish tacos which were very tasty but 4 of the six tacos across the two plates served were extremely undercooked.  We are not afraid of fish a bit under temperature but this was well below that.  

On the plus side the manager stopped by to apologize.  On the minus side he was unaware that both orders were off.  Plus - he recovered quickly and graciously said he was buying our drinks.  Minus - he comped less than half the drinks.  We were a party of 4 and none of us ordered another drink after his offer so our drinks were fully accounted for on our bill at the time and we were not trying to take advantage. Perhaps he comped just the drinks of the two who ordered the tacos but the meal was interrupted for all as we waited for the re-fire.

On to dessert.  Plus - the good and hot coffee came quickly and the chocolate infused pecan pie was delicious.  Minus - the pecan pie was very small and we were again craning our necks toward the kitchen looking for clues to its arrival as it was served well after the coffee.

Had the tacos been served correctly the first time the taste and quality of the food would have tipped this over to a 3 star review.  The food was really very good but difficult to enjoy when the overall meal was so poorly managed.  We are divided about a return visit.This place is not that great. Shogun express has way better chicken teriyaki rice bowls and beyond.
The chicken is what really bothered me here. It was really tough and extremely chewy. And that was the white meat. They're bowls are around 5 bucks which I like, but they're not even filled to the top. 
All in all I came here because Shogun was closed and there aren't any other rice bowl places in Scottsdale that I know of. Eh.I don't think this place lives up to the hype. To start,  the waitress brought us water and when we asked for lemon, she brought it on a napkin as if it were an odd request. For our meal, I ordered the Green Chili Open-Face Burger with a side salad with jalapeño ranch. I typically order ground beef well done, and this was no exception. Unfortunately, the burger I received was cooked to medium. I didn't notice at first because we were seated on the dark patio, and the string lights above us were burnt out, so we couldn't see our food. It was evening, and another waiter went around to light the candles on the tables, but I guess he forgot ours. Our waitress was unattentive, and my husband had to ask the food runner for water. When the waitress did finally acknowledge us, she apologized for not getting us more water, and then told me that my burger was probably undercooked because the stove doesn't work well. Good to know. Anyway, I'm just not sure I want to return. I came here a few years back, and the waiter forgot to put in my order until all the other people in my party were served. Unfortunately, the service here needs improvement, and though I like the food (for the most part), the service is bad enough for me to spend my money elsewhere.News Flash!  Pepins is a far cry from traditional Spanish cuisine and somehow, someone thought that they would classify it as "Basque Cuisine" also.  I guess it sounds good to throw that in.  Me thinks not!  The cuisine has nothing to do with Basque cuisine.  The Spanish cuisine is very much Americanized.  Since most people on this planet have not traveled to Pais Basco (Basque Country, located in the most northern, central region of Spain and partly in France) the owners of Pepins must think that the consumer will take their word for it.  Pepins food is not "terrible", but it's not Spanish, and it's definitely not Basque!  The service was atrocious when we went.  The Paella, was hardly a paella.  The garlic shrimp was pretty good though.  And what's up with the Salsa dancing in a "Spanish" restaurant.  Weird.

i'm giving it an extra star because I'm nice guy.  If I told actually thought, Yelp would have to come up with a separate rating scale.Well I can honestly see why this place is all over Groupon these days.  Upon arrival there was 2 people inside at 7pm on a Thursday yes 2 people.  That actually started to scare me but whatever my Groupon was going to expire so I had to use it.  So I grabbed a window seat and was greated by a server who was very nice and asked if I was using the Groupon which I stated yes and he quickly brought out the pitcher of Sangria.  The Sangria was very different then others I've had before as it had peppermint schnapps in it odd but it worked and was tasty.  I then ordered the Cordero Asado which is lamb and sun dried tomato's in olive oil.  It was just ok not bad but not great either.  I also ordered a paella de pescado y marisco which was very bland and the seafood tasted previously frozen and essentially flavorless.  I was pretty disappointed as the regular price on this dish was $32 I can't imagine paying that for what I got.  So on to the last entree which was a dry aged steak and shrimp.  The steak had been frozen and also was flavorless and the shrimp were as well.  During the meal I was just looking around inside and just kept thinking what if Gordon Ramsey could come here on Kitchen Nightmares and fix this place.  Maybe the owner will try that to revitalize the place instead of getting people in the door with Groupon.  

Cliff Note:
Don't buy the Groupon you will regret it.  Just go to Tapas Papa Frita instead :)I really hate to give bad reviews on ANYTHING...but, Ra deserves it. I mean, I went there once. It was dim, too loud, and waaaay too crowded for my tastes. They had some interesting sushi items up at the bar (the sushi bar was pretty decent), but the chef delightfully FORGETS to tell you what a sushi is if you ask (I ended up ordering a salmon roe roll...I almost threw up). Plus, the waiters and waitresses could be better and a little more attentive.

All in all, if you want some all right food in a pinch, then Ra is okay. Otherwise...I wouldn't dare venture in there again to order food.I wasn't expecting much at Chances but I was pleasantly surprised. 

It's sort of geriatric but the real old ones leave by 9. Even if they don't leave, who cares? i enjoy the low key atmosphere without having to worry about kiddies taking over the dance floors!

Chances now has two wood dance floors so it could become one of the better dance venues for the the few people that still know how to partner dance. The layout is very conducive to a social dance bar scene.

I went there two times. One time "Soul Power" was playing to a crowd of ages 40-70. People were dancing and seemed to enjoy the funky music. The band wasn't playing their best (lack of keyboardist?) but that said was probably better than most other bands that play there.

The other time a rather lame duo band sang over tracks. Their music wasn't inspiring and it wasn't very good dance music (to me it all sounded like rumba and East Coast Swing) but people were dancing -- and they weren't all old -- some were middle aged. 

The beer selection is pitiful. Maybe the worst I ever experienced! If Chances wants to attract a younger crowd they really have to do better. A bottle of Fat Tire really shouldn't be asking for too much. I had a $7 martini and it was a good value and well made. I would have given them a 3 star rating if it wasn't for the lack of beer choices. 

Parking isn't bad if you don't compete with the hip hoppers up the street.

Chances could become a nice place for adults to dance if a few more energetic bands are hired and they play until 1 am. I'm not sure what the odds are of that happening, but there is a chance. .

I will definitely give Chances a few more visits, and hopefully I'll have a better rating.The location is fantastic. With the back drop of Camelback mountain and McCormick ranch just around the corner, it is one of the nicest locations in terms of ambiance and people watching, and that's why they get that extra star. Staff us also friendly and helpful but for the life of me I can't get myself to spend south in a cup of coffee. Yes it's pretty good,bug the l and pop shops just around the corner are just as good without the necessary bank loan required. Just my 2 cents.Village Tavern isn't terrible, but it was oh-so-forgetable! 

The first time I went here I got the French Onion soup and although it was more cheese than I'd normally like, it was pretty good. The main dish I got, the Shrimp Risotto, was far from impressive. I've had better in a frozen microwave meal. 

The second time I went, which was last weekend, I got the Marinated Flank Steak with a side of potatoes Au gratin. The steak was cut very thick for flank steak and was pretty chewy. The potatoes in the Au gratin weren't cooked all the way through and were just lacking any flavor. The vegetables on the side aren't worth mentioning. 

The service both times I went was fine. Nothing too exciting, nothing to entice me to come back. As for the restaurant itself,  it's a nice looking place, but the food just doesn't live up to it. Maybe myself and those I've gone with have been ordering the wrong menu items, but I continue to not be wowed.I am from Wisconsin.  Every steakhouse in Northern Wisconsin looks, feels, and acts just like this one.  So I apologize if my review is tainted.  In summary, great meat, with little else.

The service was average, the food (in this case, the sides): average, the atmosphere...ugh.

I'll just wait to experience this...at half the price...next time I am visiting Wisconsin.I really loved the Treasure Trove located right next door to this store but when we stepped into the Antique Center, I was kind digging the red hall entryway. It was different but after that the rest of the place resembled some kind of strange museum like another Yelper mentioned. 

I saw James Brown here, his dancing toy likeness that is. If you are into the sort of thing, they have plenty of tools to buy here. When we wandered into the back we ran into this creepy mannequin re-enactment of the last supper featuring man sized mannequins under an eerie florescent light. A little unsettling and I swear I could feel their eyes following me as I passed by. I noticed a lot of tribal items here in this store. 

That aside, as we went throughout the store everything had this dusty, attic type feel to it. Lots of taxidermic animals, some missing vital parts and some were very dusty. I kept finding weird mannequins throughout the store, I guess they were there to showcase the merchandise? There were no merchants there but we had a fellow come talk to us and the woman at the front was pretty friendly. We didn't leave with anything that day. I recommend Merchant Square instead.RA is OK. I like Happy hour mainly for the cheap food and Saki/beer. The sushi on the other hand is just meh! It's good but its not what I consider real sushi or quality sushi. It's Arizona Sushi! Coming from LA and San Diego, this would be pathetic sushi! But some it is OK and I can tolerate it at HH due to the prices. I would not go here during regular hours and regular prices.I'm gonna have to go against the grain a bit here - I wanted SO badly to love this place! I had only heard good things, and the theme - although a bit over the top - is fun.

I ordered some Thai Teriyaki something something local special that they had written on a little blackboard in the front. It sounded amazing.

What I unwrapped was a sauce-filled mess with 6 flakes of weird lettuce and white tomato slices. Oh and a metric fuckton of pepper. The bun ripped apart at the seam, presumably because of the enormous amount of sauce that was on the sandwich. And I'm a SAUCE girl, people. If it pours or you can dip it then I want a lot of it. But this was over the top for even me. I threw over half my sandwich away. 

The staff was fine but unremarkable, no real complaint there. 

The inside is kind of grimy feeling but I get that it's part of the theme. If the sandwich was amazing it'd definitely be forgivable. 

Normally I'd give it a second chance, but with SO many different sub places around, I probably won't risk it again here.This wasn't the worst stay I have ever had in a hotel.  The stay went quite nice, but the room was simply unkept.  I only stayed for one night on business.  The grounds looked really nice - meaning the building, landscaping and decorations were nice.  The room, however, was not.

I walked in to a standard room with beer bottles all over the desk - some full, some empty.  The floor was not vacuumed.  It was clearly gross.  There were small stains on one of the bed comforters.  The iron worked, but the dial to select steam or dry broke as soon as I touched it.  The water that came from the tub faucet was slightly more than a trickle.  All soap products were left with the wrappers off as if they had been used previously.  The beds... they were turned down perfectly with fresh clean sheets.  

Some would say that I should have demanded a different room.  But after a 5 hour flight, and the worst jet lag to boot, I decided to make the best of it.  I can't complain about my sleep or the stay.  It went very well.  I had cold cereal for free in a small room in the small lobby with no problems.  The continental breakfast provided is very basic.  It worked for me.

Overall, this place seems like it is in a questionable area of Tempe.  The location has it's pros and cons - good location in the big scheme of the Phoenix Valley, but bad location as neighborhoods go.  I would not go walking around at night.  It looks good from the outside, but my room was a mess.

I guess if I wanted to be harsh I could give it one star.  But my stay actually went quite smooth.  However, I definitely would not stay there again or recommend that anyone else stay there until they get a better staff to clean the rooms properly.If you are needing to get your perscriptions filled quickly and professionally, you might want to pick another location.

They are very busy, but slow, and relatively indifferent to their customers.

They made it far more of a hassle than it should have been, as I waited 45 minutes after the 35 minutes they initially said it would take to fill my order.First time today. Prime rib was tough and over cooked. Best part of the meal was the bread. Over price for the quality of food they are serving. Atmosphere is ok. Like how the servers tell you the history of the building. Service was good.  I will not be coming back because of the food.First, I'm not a sandwich person (must still be shell-shocked from all those brown bags in high school).  The guy at super sign in the same shopping mall suggested I go there to grab a quick lunch. 

Waited in line too long to order. I an attempt to practice patience I decided to Zen and go with the flow. With order finally placed I waited and waited. The line grew steadily longer and still there was only one cashier and one prep person, or so it appeared.  I checked my email and Facebook and still no sandwich. Hmmm.  So much for grabbing a fast lunch. 

Get back to the office which is only 5 minutes away and dug in. Uck. The turkey was bland and the bread soggy. Not very appealing.  The ice tea was delightful though. :)

Maybe it's what I ordered or my basic instinct to not eat sandwiches but it's a thumbs down from me. Must say that the person taking orders was friendly and did his best. I wish he had help during busy lunch times.Ehhh.....it was ok. Quesadilla was ok......Carne Asada burrito my daughter had was down right aweful. Queso dip was good. I doubt I'll be back. GREAT service tho, very attentive and polite waitress.If the Diavola pizza wasn't good, I would have only left 1 star. I arrived with my dinner guest for a Friday night dinner at 8:15p.  It took the server 5-10 minutes to acknowledge us, and she was unprofessional and awkward. Instead of a hello, or welcome, I was greeted with "do you want to order, or can I get you drinks"? When we ordered our pizza, and she continued to suggest that we order a salad because the pizza would take awhile, I should have known I'd be in for a long night. By the time our order was placed, it was 8:25.  Our appetizer (aglio olio-standard, not awesome) came in a timely fashion. After eating the bread, drinking my drink, and thinking to myself "huh, its been a while"...I glanced at the time. It was 9:10.  I proceeded to watch a man at another table raise his hand for service, and hold it up for nearly 3m. It was 9:30 by the time my pizza came. An hour to bring out a pizza is outrageous. You only have one opportunity to make a first impression Classic Italian, and you lost me as a customer.No regard for customer service, but hey, they had what I needed--old-school PC-TV converter. They seem to live by the motto, if we stock it, they will come. An overwhelming store to try to navigate, and no product help from employees (who are all male, it seems, and attired like Mormon missionaries who don't know what an iron is). If you have any patience, go to the Internet. If not, go to Fry's (for as long as they survive?).I guess since im not a native from Arizona I dont see the big whoop in Cerreta Candy. 
They have some chocolates, they some caramels, they have some nuts. 

We did the tour through the factory and it was nothing special. The first 20 people in line got to actually learn about the candy. The rest of us got to walk by it and if we attempted to stop and look were told "OK! Let's move on people" nice! 

I would say the best tasting was the caramel.I paid $27 for 8 fish and chips, cole slaw and hush puppies.  I was very disappointed.  Fish was square patty,  cole slaw taste terriable, KFC's taste much better.  4 tiny tiny hush puppies are $1.50.  I had better fish and chips at Ivar's in Seattle, WA and Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  It didn't worth it.The casino has improved quite a bit since the renovations.  

I booked a room here for Final Four weekend because I was curious how the Spike stacked up against other downtown casinos.  The room was OK, I think you can do as well for the price at many other places downtown.  The room was small and my sink wouldn't drain, and the wi-fi was about worthless...but what to you want for less than $40/night?

I have to be honest - I didn't spend a lot of time in the casino itself because I got a fairly bad vibe from the clientele.  

If I am staying downtown, I would rather stay at a casino on Fremont itself rather than run the gauntlet over to Ogden....that's just me, though.I guy named Stephen from NY reviewed this place perfectly. Look at his review.

 I felt like it was a dining room at a fancy retirement home in the basement of a janky casino. The salad was great and everything else excluding the entree was nice, but the entree was very underwhelming. I was glad we bought a coupon for 25% off our bill from Tix 4 Tonight because I would have felt ripped off without it.Have you ever stayed at a hotel in Central America during the 80s?  Well, if you haven't, come over to the Cortez and travel back in time.  

Sure, it is $35 a night, but that is if you can sleep with all the sounds coming around and below you.

Took forever and a half to check-in.  I slept with my clothes on.  The only reason they didn't get 1 star from me is because they are dirt(y) cheap, good location for downtown activities, and free parking.

But not cheap enough to attract me back.  I rather pay a few bucks extra and live the good life in Vegas.

The hotel is perfect for hooker banging and/or drug deals.been a fan favorite of the Nugget for years but this trip convinced me to spend my money elsewhere next time we hit Vegas. this place has pulled the purse strings so tight that I am sure if they could figure out a way to charge you for the elevator and they would and probably a front door charge as wedll, they push the no resort fee because they are downtown but believe me they make up for it everywhere else, valet staff were happy and friendly other than that good luck, grouchy almost bitchy front desk people with rotten attitude, maybe they forgot the rule about the customer is there paycheck, do not take the upgrades to jr suites pretty much all you get is a hallway and if your in the rush tower stay off the fremont side unless you want to hear really bad rock and roll bouncing off your rooom walls untill 2 am and trash cans being hit hard by the garbage truck at 6 am in the alley next door and its Saturday WOW! after this being my hotel of choice since the 80's got to find another one. and in agreement with the guy below me in this review good luck getting a chair at the pool since they are saving every cahir in site and you never see anyone sit down my advice is if someone says they are saving seats take it anyway and let security get involved maybe they will be better than the rest of their staff this place rolled downhill in a hurryFerraro's was wholeheartedly disappointing, and there wasn't much that came as a positive from my visit.  The atmosphere was stuffy, as was our waiter, who felt it was more important to correct our pronunciation than to remember what we ordered.  The food was not bad, but was not up to par with the price tag.  I had the osso buco, which was okay, but it no where close to the best I've had in Vegas; the farro that accompanied it was bland and didn't pair as well as one would hope.  The appetizers and deserts were good, but didn't stand out from any other italian restaurant I've been to in the past few years.  It almost felt like they weren't even trying to impress us when we visited.

My relatively high expectations were no where close to met, and I don't foresee myself returning anytime soon.First off, I should comment that my husband made a reservation for the wrong restaurant and at 7 pm on a Friday night, we got right in.

Other than that, my experience was less than gratifying.

The calamari fritti was good, sauce was pretty good.

I was pretty upset to find that the menu on the website is not even a representation of the menu provided in the restaurant. The website says copyright 2012, but Ferraro's does NOT serve Eggplant Parmigiana as stated on their website, nor is their Chicken Parmigiana $20. It was $24.  Also, I've NEVER been to an ITALIAN restaurant that serves broccoli, carrots and POTATOES (potatoes!? seriously?!) with ANYTHING in marinara sauce. Especially since the menu both on the website and IN THE RESTAURANT says "served with pasta."

NOT IMPRESSED. Still searching for a REAL ITALIAN restaurant outside of NY.First (and last) time here! Nice to be known at your local restaurant but to be in line and have individuals known to the staff pulled and seated ahead is not appropriate. Service was fast and friendly however food was cold where next to plate. Quantity was good. Servers question on how was the food was rhetorical and had he not made it as a statement and as a question he would have had the same feedback.This place has great service but nothing much else.  The rooms here are dingy and outdated.  I guess that's why it's so cheap.

There is a mandatory $15 resort fee which allows you internet access through an ethernet cable (who uses these still?!), gym access, and phone calls.  It is nowhere worth $15.

The bathrooms are gross.  The towels are cheap and stiff.  I recommend your own toiletries if you do decide to stay here.

The bed wasn't that bad but the sheets are pretty old and I was freezing cold.  With the heater, I thought I was going to suffocate and each time it turned on, it scared the daylights out of me.

I would only stay here again if I was desperate.  Yes I enjoyed the staff, but the amenities are just not worth it.

My last piece of advice if you should decide to stay here, is avoid the buffet at all costs.  You will waste your money and come out sick or hungry or both.We're at the LVCC this weekend for my daughter's volleyball championship games. It's coinciding with a basketball tournament, so plenty of people.

The first complaint? $65 for a spectator pass for the weekend for my family (husband, myself and son). Which would be fine if they weren't also charging $10/day for parking and if they had more concessions open. Only a coffee cart, beverage cart and Capriottis is open. Ridiculous. 

Charging for parking is considerably shady since we all have to drag in coolers for the girls so they have snacks and water for the tournament. I don't think we'll be participants in this tournament next year.Okay, this was stop number 2 on our Happy hour hop and I was more than disappointed with this location. My first firefly experience was at the downtown location and it was amazing. This time we walked in and I was not sure if the happy hour was contained to one area so I asked the hostess if we needed to sit at the bar for happy hour and she said nope.. You have about 10 minutes left of happy hour so we will get you seated quickly so we can get you a round or two during happy hour. That right there made me happy, they had already started to show that small glimmer of hope that the downtown location shines radiantly with. After being seated that little light i was just talking about must have burnt out because it was horrid. We sat for about 13 minutes... Yes I counted, and when the server came I asked just to make sure, " Our first round is on happy hour right? We have been sitting here for quite some time" she responded with, " Nope, It's over."  
I nicely said to her, " We were sat roughly 15 minutes ago and happy hour ended 5 minutes ago and there is nothing you can do? Again I received, "Nope It's Over, can i get something for you? " So i then said, " Nope, I'm done thank you" . 

Needless to say we walked out of firefly without eating any of the awesome sliders or the bacon wrapped dates. It's a shame but I could not stand for that on that particular day!!

Sorry Firefly on paradise, I will continue to hit the downtown location and hope nothing like this happens there.I went to Harrah's for a few days on the weekend following Thanksgiving, a relatively slow time.  For $55 I cannot complain, but I can see why it was so cheap.  The room had almost no light, even with the shades drawn and the lights on.  The toilet seat had a few drops of dried urine on it when we arrived.  There seemed to be a trace of lipstick or nail polish on one of the towels.  On my last morning, housekeeping must have knocked on the door or attempted to get in 3 times within an hour. Talk about giving the bum's rush...

There are ads for the Rita Rudner comedy act EVERYWHERE.  They bombard you with them all over town.  She instantly became a huge inside joke for us and I am sure for many others as well.

The casino is kind of lame, although the dealers are very friendly and helpful.  Everywhere you look you'll see "real 'mericans." You know who I'm talking about.  The overweight, often geriatric, blue collar types from the flyover states.  Nothing against good honest folk, that was just my impression of the clientele that you would rub shoulders with here.  Overall, I have to say this place kinda sucks, but then again, it's Vegas, you don't come here for R&R and you're doing something wrong if you're spending enough time in your room that it's a major issue for you.  

Bottom line: if you're going to Vegas to have some fun with your buddies, this place does the job for its price.  If you're trying to be a baller and impress the ladies, look elsewhere.The room was modern and it started off being clean nice bed and everything else but from there it went to hell.  I chose stay at Circus Circus because I have my two small children and my mother with me We were in town for a wedding.  The kids enjoyed the adventure dome.  But we had major issues with housekeeping I asked them to come around 1 o'clock because I knew I was good to be in the room most of the morning they never came.  I called the front desk to complain about this at around 830 9 o'clock that evening and actually said sent someone from housekeeping in an attempt at 10 o'clock at night try to clean my room.  Needless to say my children were  bed as it was not a good experience.  I went to check out at around 430 in the morning I flew out at a different time from  the rest of my family I needed to print boarding passes for them  and attempted to use my free coupon for the business center.  They notified me that they were unable to help me with the coupon until everything opens at 7 AM I was under the impression it was a place was open 24 hours a day and that i would get good customer service don't go there if that's what you think.  I was told that there was nothing they could do to help me but there is no way I could print my boarding passes without having to pay exorbitant fees even though they were going to provide me with free service after 7 AM and top of it when I complained about the housekeeping debacle they told me I should have remembered to put my do not disturb sign on my door. I've decided to try to use the self-service Internet kiosk and print my boarding tickets from there and pay for the kiosk is down so I was left with no way to leave my mother and children their boarding passes. In the end I would never go back there again I may take my children there to ride rides but to be honest there are many other cool things in Las Vegas to see then a rundown stinky hotel.I love Hugo Boss clothing, I mean their stuff tends to just fit me right. and well they make perfect clothing for work, nice dinner occasions, and of course...hitting up the club in style without looking like every other Asian wearing Banana Republic. 

  Anyway after my great luck at Hugo Boss last Vegas trip, I decided to stop in again for another shirt prior to going out. So since when is a 5'9 210 lb guy size XXL?!? I mean L or XL maybe...but XXL?  Maybe the Vegas Hugo Boss only carries the European sizes or something because all the Nordstrom Hugo Boss stuff I've tried on I fit Large and on a very rare occasion XL.

  What's worse is when I first walked in there were four people working all standing by the counter, they took one glance at me and continued talking...no greeting whatever. And I had full intention of picking up a $160-200 shirt in the next 5-10 minutes (quick sale right?).  After about 5 minutes of looking and talking with my girlfriend, a lady finally approached us and offered to help. Let's just say the next 10 minutes we were there she was overly aggressive with the sale as opposed to what actually fit me and would look good on me. Lady I know I'm not a male model, but clothing should still fit me right if I'm going to spend that much money on it.

  Anyway my last experience at Hugo Boss in Vegas has left a sour taste in my mouth. I will now come back with extreme caution.

~GThere is no point.  We once rode on it for fun.  That was about it.  And we haven't rode on it since.  Yeah.  Hopefully the locals are using it...'cause I don't know who else would be.  Yeah.Don't care for this place. Went once, never to return.
Service is blah-My friends and I just got back from vacation here.  We went through Casablanca Express and got a good deal . . . Or so we thought.
This place is horrible and I will never stay here again.
There was a cockroach crawling on the wall in our room as soon as we came in.
When we went down stairs for compensation, the manager acted like we were inconveniencing her.  I believe her name was Dorothy.  We made our reservation for an EK bed in a smoking room.
We got 2 full size mattress in a cockroach room.
The manager, after coming back 3 times, finally upgraded us to the Signature suites and refunded our resort fees after giving us hella attitude. NOT ENOUGH!
The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because NICHOL was amazing with helping us out and I LOVED the Batman slot game.  Othwerwise, I give this place 1 star!
DO NOT STAY HERE.  This place is seriously overpriced (rooms, drinks, buffet, etc.), cockroach filled and their customer service is a joke.
My friends and I will never stay here again.Older casino on the strip.  If you are going to the strip, you should hit the big flashier casino to get the full Vegas experience.  But if you are going for a smaller laid back feel, you might as well hit one of the local Station casinos or The Orleans.  Cleaner and more up to date.  This casino definitely looks like old school 'has been'.  It needs some serious updating.This hotel is horrible u get what you pay for. The reason why I stayed here is because of a festival I came with a group of friends. This hotel is old , the restrooms ohhhh lord they are very small. Also if you want to take a cab it takes forever. This hotel is sad. If ur on a budget this hotel is cheap but expect the worst.Anyone who knows me knows that I am a MAKEUP / PRODUCT junkie!!  I can spend hours in Sephora just playing with make up.  Normally when I go to Sephora, I am greeted and immediately asked if I need help.  Well this time, I was not greeted by anyone....heck I was the one speaking to them.  I noticed that there was an employee who looked like she was PRAYING that I wouldn't ask her anything.  As a matter of fact there were at least 3 of them.  The only one who made me feel welcomed, was a young man / short with nice eyebrows.  He was cool.  Dear Sephora Vegas - work on CUSTOMER SERVICE.  We are on vacation and have money to spend.  Dont you need that??   Your staff that worked on Fri Jan 13th was the worst!Skanky hotel jammed in the meat and potatoes of the strip.  The Bellagio, Paris, Ceasars, etc flank this run-down Reno-style casino.  

But this is where I began my Vegas runs, posing as an older member of the human race.  You can grab $2 blackjack.  And I believe my friends and I played 8 hrs of straight $1 craps when I just turned legal age...to smoke.I signed up for Yelp just so that I could let people know more about the Casino Royale...

Customer Service is not something that the Casino Royale Hotel should be known for.

We arrived early Friday morning, and were not able to check in early, despite being told that we would be able to if a room was available.  After our second attempt at getting into a room, they took our number and told us that if one was available before the official time, they would call us.

We received no call, and checked in at 1pm.  After being up for over 30 hours, we went to bed, waking up only to venture out for dinner.

The next morning we were awakened at 11am by a phone call from housekeeping, informing us that housekeeping would be leaving at 11:30, and if we wanted our rooms clean, they would have to be cleaned within the next 15 minutes.

When it came time to check out, we asked for an extra hour late check-out via a personal phone, due to the hotel phone having broken.  We were then informed that Casino Royale "doesn't do late check-outs".

Overall, you get what you pay for.  Casino Royale is first and foremost a cheap casino, with the hotel an afterthought.It's Applebee's what can you expect. Sadly I think I have been spoiled by the one in Bismarck ND. Took my family to this one for there first visit to an Applebee's to see what I often talk about after my trips to ND. Sadly this one didn't cut it. Service was ok but not exceptional, booth was tidy but not clean. I could handle all that if food was up to standard but sadly tonight it missed the mark in a big way. If your going to cook frozen steak defrost it first, using the grill to finish the defrost process while cooking ruins steak! Two steak meals both ordered medium rare, 4 individual steaks and not one of them cooked medium rare when was well done the other jelly red in the centre and burnt on the outside.  Wish I had read the reviews first,On my visit to coyote ugly last month with my fiancé. We stopped by this bar at the new York new York and where surprised to it does not live up to the movie/fame. They have a little bar upfront that sells drinks all night and then the bar inside.

We got inside for free, drinks where expensive but not much more than you come to expect in vegas. However 2 dollar drafts were advertised and we were charged 7 dollars. There were barely any places to sit, this bar had 4 or 5 bar stools if that. Even with no place to sit this bar is small. I would imagine with a larger crowd it could be quite uncomfortable to be in.

None of the girls that worked there where dancing that much. They got up on stage for a few seconds and did a very poor job riling up the crowd. Door staff was rude, and the girls are the only ones who get free shots guys don't get to participate in any of the drinking games or shots and get treated like crap by the staff and girls for no reason at all. I suppose if you went with a bunch of girls for a girls night out you might have fun, even then you would have to ignore all the cons about this place.

The only good thing about this place is the bar outside. You can get a large novelty cup full of alcohol and get it refilled for a decent price. If I could I would give the bar outside 5 stars I would have. This place is a dive, stay away Dick's Last Resort in the Excalibur is MUCH better!I haven't been here for a while as I found it unremarkable on my last visit.  Soup, salad and other items outside of the main meal were forgettable, entree items from the rodizio were reasonably good, sometimes a little off (i.e. dry turkey), service was very hit or miss, with wait staff either moderately attentive or hard to get a hold off.  Decor and sensibility of restaurant was dated and uninteresting.

I have not been to other options in town (i.e. Texas de Brazil, Samba or Brasil) other than Rumjungle's rodizio, which was a little better on the food, but I did not like the club atmosphere (and I hold nothing against them on the club atmosphere, as this is delivered as advertised but not my taste for dining at least).

Would recommend trying other options.I took my wife here for Valentine's Day/Anniversary. The restaurant was nice and the ambiance was good as well. However, we were not that impressed with the steaks. I've had much better for way less. The only high point of the meal was the lobster mac and cheese. The rest was just OK. We ordered a bake potato and they brought it out plain with no sides (sour cream, chives, bacon bits, cheese). At $8, it should come with all the fixings or at least ask if we would like it. We also ordered Lobster tails which were served with no butter. Even Red Lobster knows to serve lobster with butter. We asked for the server to bring us butter and after about 5 minutes, it arrived. Of all the high end steak houses we've been to, this was probably the least memorable. When you're paying the high premium to eat at these steak houses, it should be above average. Del Frisco was just plain mediocre.TERRIBLE SERVICE but good food. Pretty pricy for curry. If you wanna see the most unfriendly servers, this is the place to go. I will never go back there, tho.The waiters could be more courteous and not have an expression that made me feel like I've entered a funeral home.
Buffet items were bland and blah. Rotis were delicious. Nice ambience. 
My gripe with this place just like most Indian places is the lack of spice and flavor in they food, for some reason the dishes lack the character of their Indian counterparts. In India the same dish will be extremely flavorful. My first mistake I guess comparing with the taste back home. But what's the point in calling yourself fine Indian cuisine if you can't be authentic and recreate the exact flavors??
Also, my mom without knowing the "rules of the land" asked for pickles, the staff were extremely helpful and got her a cup full of it and later slipped me an extra $1.50, when asked why he goes oh, if it's not on the menu then you pay. OK!!! why can't you tell her that first, instead of slipping one in, not that I had a problem paying for it, he is right, but the lack of customer service or ethics just irked me.
Buffet is reasonably priced with enough items, improve customer service, remember it's the customer who makes or breaks your business. Improve flavor don't forget the roots of the dish. I know it is dumbed down to cater to local tastes but hey if I want to eat bland food I have lot of cheaper and healthier options.After viewing those unbelievably talented Chefs on The Iron Chef shows, I had a craving for the best French food while staying at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas.  I walked around for half an hour, and was totally frustrated (and hungry at 10PM after a long flight) that I could not find a real French restaurant by walking around the Paris casino lobby.  Finally, the concierge walked me to the Eiffel Tower, "that's where you find real French food."  Oui!  An older middle-aged lady, very well-dressed and hmmm.... well-proportioned ...  took me to the elevator behind her.  In a few seconds through layers of steel super structures, I arrived at the restaurant.  

Scene 1:  First Impression.  Elevator opens to the kitchen with displays of dishes, stainless steel wares, and busboys. If my synapses were not all firing tonight, I would have thought I'd entered the restaurant through the kitchen from the alley.  1 out of 5 stars.   

Scene 2:  Chit Chat.  The greeter took me to the Hostess kiosk where I had to wait for the boy/girl chit chatting before they would address me.  1/5.

Scene 3:  They asked for my reservation name.  The restaurant was half full (empty?) so I said I did not have one.  She said "Let me find a table for you."  Within minutes, they found a table for me -- on the inside wall where the view was to another table.  Wait, what's wrong with any of the tables overlooking the Bellagio water fountain dancing thing?  They were all sitting empty.... vacant... unoccupied..  "Well, Sir, we are trying to shut down that portion of the restaurant this time of the night, but let me check."  As if he was a Secret Service agent, he touched his ear and talk into his wrist and then asked me to return to the lobby while they set up my new table!  Now we talking.  3 out of 5. 

Scene 4:  The Tea.  "Shall we start you with some wine perhaps?"  "No, thank you.  I will have green tea please."  "Am sorry, we have no green tea.  But we have black and peach tea.  Very nice."  Am easy to please, so I agreed to the peach tea.  What came out?  Ice tea!  Am easy to please, so I kept the ice tea, unsweetened out of a very nice bottle.  "Can I also get a cup of hot tea, please."  "Am sorry Sir, we don't have hot tea."  Really? The French don't drink tea?  How do you all get sober after being drunk from all that wine?  What am I going to wash down my fine dining with?  I can't really ask for a Coke Zero.  If the French don't drink hot tea, am certain they won't drink Coke Zero.  She gave an uncomfortable smile as I gave her an awkward frown on the tea thing.  "Perhaps you would like coffee instead."  I told her I'm mormon.  That stopped further suggestions.  I was thinking of Dave (mormon friend) when I said that.  I was satisfied that my response immediately wiped away her smile.  1/5.

Scene 5:  The Appetizer.  The fun begins here.  Food tastes great at a great restaurant.  Food would probably taste heavenly if you are hungry, at the "finest French restaurant in Vegas," in the  Paris hotel perched high in the Eiffel tower.  I escargot.  "But I want you to know, it only comes with 5 escargots."  What on my forehead said I wanted a pound of escargots sautéed and served on a hot dog bun?  I smiled and politely said that was a great portion.  A few minutes later... "Am sorry Sir.  The chef said we are out of escargot for tonight."  But it's a French restaurant!  It's like McD is out of french fries.  Fine.  What else ya got?  After some prodding to try cold smoked salmon, I settled on "giant scallops on a bed of ox tail."  After a weekend of pho at home, I am up to my eye browse with ox tails, but the scallops was appealing because it was light.  I want to be French tonight.  Light portions.  Great presentation.  Explosive tastes.  The scallop (one) wasn't giant. but it was good.  The oxtail was horrendous, however.  You know the levels of saltiness.  At the bottom it is bland, then a hint of salt, then "to taste", then salty, then really salty, then bitter.  Mine was bitter.  2 out of 5.  

Scene 6:  The Bread.  Before the appetizer came out, the bread man came along.  It was a nice silver tray with different breads laid out in rows to categorize the different breads.  He took 2 spoons and created a make-shift tong to handle the bread. French-like.  I chose the sesame seed bread.  Then he said "you get to choose two."  Oh my gosh!  For a $100 meal I get to choose 2.  What if I wanted 3?  1 star.  

Scene 7:  Duck.  Perfectly cooked.  Red.  Moist.  Skin wasn't crunchy as I preferred.  They served the duck on a bed of what tasted like salty and smooshy fruit cake.  Did not complement well at all.  I had to cut the muscle and skin from the breast.  The reduction encircling the duck was again salty. 2/5.

Scene 8:  Desert.  The banana souffle was the highlight.  I had to order it first so the chef can start it right away.  Fluffy, light, airy.  Exactly how it should be.  5/5.

Not worth it.  View was nice, though.The staff was very friendly and helpful, offering to show my dinner guest the way to the men's room.  The view is breathtaking and wherever you are in the restaurant you can get a glimpse of the awesome fountain show at Bellagio.

The food is pretty mediocre all the way.  Pricey, my dish was $44 for black cod baked in a bag.  My dinner guest had short ribs, pretty small portions for $52.  For these prices, they can do much better with the quality of food in terms of presentation and the taste.  But then again, you are paying for location and view.

I thought it would be super touristy but it wasn't at all that bad.  Probably be more like 2 1/2 stars as opposed to 2.  Would probably not go back there again but was worth the experience for the view.Good size portion but service here has never been great. They don't come around and check how your doing or if you need refills so pace yourself on your drinks. Food has always been good and plentiful and it's not a bad place if you can get past the service.Bad gym for a date. Gym uses auto ropes so no need for someone to belay at the bottom. To belay you have to take their class and then pay for them to "test" your skills briefly. Tried to get assistance for 20+ minutes wanting to belay a friend and go through the hoops. Waste of time with 3 different employees. i have my belay card from another gym on me too. Whole point was to get friend experience with process before she goes rock climbing outside for her first time. Not very big. I would never come here or recommend to adult friend. I would recommend to friend with a kid, as the auto ropes are good for them. 

Would give 1 star, but 2 stars because its good for kids.Wasn't very I'm presses with the level of service in the store, nor the organization of employees.

Woman asks how she can help us. I tell here need to know where the calendar boards are, she says okay no problem someone will help you.. Just walk to the, and meet them in the middle of the store on the left. Huh? Should an employee meet me? Why did you ask if you could help me if your pondering me off on another employee? Why can't you just tell me where the damn boards are!! Ugh 

Sadly I should have just gone to walmart to get it. It probably would have been cheaper. Especially since my roommate just bought one there and it was 10 bucks and I just paid 12.There's only one problem with Mimi's, and it's the food!

The design and concept are great, but the food itself is some of the worst in Summerlin.  It's hard to mess up breakfast foods, but they managed to serve lumps of overcooked eggs and undercooked bacon.  Their croissants are doused in butter, and not even in a good way.

Le disgusting.  (I doubt my French is very good, but it's still better than Mimi's)Washed my gf car while waiting for her at the dentist, besides the fact that it rained right after the only good thing about this place was the discounted gas, the car wash was mediocre at best, I would not recomend it to anyone, better of doing it at a gas station for 7 dollars ur self, paid 24.99, and tipped 5 dollars, and got my car back with dirt all over the ground in the car, and the glasses cleaned half ass, rims with dirt, I get a 10 times better wash at half the price in cali! dont wate your money! go somewhere else or get the cheapest wash...I have gone here on and off for a couple years now, but will not be going back. It is very dirty. Spilled polish everywhere and general uncleanliness. The tech doing my partners pedicure stopped in the middle to trim her own cuticles with the same tools. That's not sanitary! And to top it all off, when the lady waxed my eyebrows, she burned my face with the wax, leaving behind a small sore and ultimately scab under my eyebrow. Pick a different place.Always crowded. I prefer going to other Walmarts.Average food with sub-par service. Ordered Italian dressing on my salad, got blue cheese. Ok. Ordered chicken, got shredded beef. Whatever.  Ordered the guacamole, it was simple and fresh, but all in all, nothing to bring me back.Very sketchy hotel. The rooms felt like a motel. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because it was extremely cheap and in a pretty convenient location. But I would not come here again.Service was a little scarce, seems to be only one server for our half of the restaurant. Biscuits and gravy are bland, bacon is good though. This is my first time here, so I'm sure they should have other menu items that should be good to constitute a 4 out of 5 star rating.Well what can I say other than I was disappointed. 

Came here for lunch with the Fiance and won't be returning. It wasn't that the food was bad, it just wasn't good. I'd rather spend my money elsewhere. 

I had the chicken fried steak and eggs with hashbrowns. The eggs were, well eggs. Cooked the way I liked it, but just eggs. The hashbrowns were cooked really good too, but had zero flavor. The steak was nicely breaded but there was too much egginess from the batter. There was no flavor development in the gravy. Just salt (but wasn't too salty). At least put some pepper in the gravy!

The fiance had the French Dip. The whole thing looked like they bought all their supplies at the nearest grocery store. The bread was simple and there was only roast beef on the sandwich. The meat looked like it was pre-packaged and the au jus tasted like it came out of a box. On top of the poor food quality, our waitress spilled the au jus on her way out with it so the bread on the bottom was soaked and fell apart while you ate it. The waitress was very nice still, but bad mistake. 

The only thing I guess worth complimenting were the sweet potato fries. They were cooked nicely and they added powdered sugar on top. I hadn't seen that done before and the sweetness of the potato paired well with the sweetness of the sugar. 

But all in all, no plans to return.Since the start of the football season this bar claimed to tailor to NY Giant's fans. We went there 2 weeks ago and had a decent time. The bar wasn't really busy and we were able to get a seat at the bar. We went back today and found out the owners don't want to cater to the Giant's fans and they are non-denominational - say's Melissa (bartender). They took the banner down that said "home of the NY Giant's". Many patrons, including us, said we will not be going back as Melissa said she can not guarantee the game/sound will be be on. Pretty rotten to change things up mid season. Thought we found a new place, but we'll have to keep looking.

On a good note, they have $1 sliders and $.50 cent wings during the game. The sliders are tasty!With the new modern steak houses popping up all over, older steak houses like Durants become a flash back in time. Most of the clientele was well over 60, all the sides were bland and heavy. Honestly felt like eating at a retirement home. Steaks were over priced and just not worth it. Our waiter along with another near by were completely obnoxious, pushing deserts like they were trying to make a used car quota. Skip this place and grab a steak at another American Bistro. Most offer at least one great steak at a reasonable price and of similar quality.Just finished lunch here. Wasn't impressed $20 street enchiladas. And $13 street tacos. We ordered the guacamole it was more of an avocado salad. Won't be running back anytime soon.I visited a couple times about 25 years ago, when my future wife was infatuated with one of the bartenders. TeePee seemed reasonably satisfying back then and I cant decide if tastes have changed that much or the food has objectively fallen off a cliff. 

It may be a little of both. 

Table service was friendly but inattentive, if that makes sense.  Decor is Flintstones meets Happy Days on the Oregon Trail. Or something.  Which would be fun....if the food was edible.  Prices run a buck or two higher than many Mexican chains; again, reasonable only if the food was better. Or even as good, as BajaFresh, Taco Bell or Chipotle. 

In this industry, there's a thin line between venerable charm and past- its-prime trap, and if you insist on lousy ingredients and dont bother to ask customers how they want their heuvos cooked, then even if your front hostess is a doll, you're on the wrong side of that line.It is what it is - a dated hotel, in the middle of the strip with nothing around.

The draw is the big old saucer sitting at the top. Yup!
I was here for the Stair Climb that takes place inside one of the struts and supports the American Lung Association.

I booked on line and it was extremely cheap and affordable. What was a bummer, was that the "deal" price that American Lung Assoc got, was more than the on line price. Boo.

I did not choose to upgrade my room to have a re-ferbed room and to have a view. There is a whole saucer up there to enjoy the view from, duh. And i was really only coming in to do the race and head back home. So i did not upgrade. My room was directly in front of the elevators. ugh. There was a limited power plugs, furnishings were dated, but i'm assuming once the full refurb gets done this will be updated.

We were in a handicapped accessible room, which is fine, but there was no place in the bathroom to put your stuff. Barely room to stick your tooth brush. And the towels were across the room. I pity the handicapped person attempting to dry off after their shower or bath.

Elevators were pretty speedy. Shops were ok. Restaurant on site had a great menu, we enjoyed some wonderful appetizers. 

I'm not a gambler, but the casino seemed small and meh. The smoke smell wasn't too terrible, but certainly noticeable since i was there to do a race for American Lung Association.

Note: there is a starbucks on site and they do a pretty good job!

All in all - it's the stratosphere...  take it for what it is. You get what you get!I came here on a Saturday night in Vegas. When I came in through the front door there were about 11 seats in the waiting area which were all full of customers waiting already. I put my name on the waiting list and was told it would be a 25 minute wait and that I could wait at the Bar. When I went to the bar all the seats were taken as well so I had no choice but to wait outside the restaurant. Luckily, it wasn't very busy that night and I only had to wait for 15 minutes for a party of 2. BEWARE usually it's about a 2 hour wait. 

I ordered the Nam Kao Tod which is a crispy rice that's quite sour tasting. In my opinion it was a little too sour for a rice dish. 

Next I had the coconut chicken soup (Tom Kah Kai) and it tasted like coconut milk mixed with chile oil. It was sweet so it seemed like a dessert but it had chicken and mushrooms which also made the dish savory. This mixture was a bit too odd for me and I would definitely not order this dish again. 

The Drunken Noodle with Soft Shell Crab was also pretty disappointing considering the price. It was 18.95 with a small plate of noodles with a sprinkle of soft shell crab legs. Out of all the dishes I ordered I only liked the Musaman curry which was OK. 

If you came here on a busy night and had to wait longer than 30 minutes I would recommend not coming here considering the price. If you do decide to wait it out DON'T order the Nam Kao Tod, Tom Kah Kai, and Drunken Noodle with Soft Shell Crab.

Overall the service was good, the items I ordered were pretty bad with the exception of the Musamam curry, and I would probably not come here again.We have eaten at this place before and really loved the food.   This time (Jan 26) we were so disappointed! The service was sooo bad we didn't couldn't enjoy the food.  Just wanted to get out.  We had to wait after being seated for a long time, practically ignored and the food was just dumped at the table .  Poor, poor. The food was tasty, have to say, but we probably won't go back.  There are just too many  other excellent places that want your business.Cold as hell and overly sweet would sum up my brunch experience today.   I wouldn't say I had a stellar first time at Brocach.  It was literally the coldest restaurant I've been in-we had a group of 18 people and every single person was unimpressed with the temperature of the restaurant.  If you have a warehouse of a restaurant, you really should be prepared to ensure your customers are not wearing their coats while eating.  Additionally, by the time food gets to your table, its cold too.  No one seemed to complain because I'm guessing at that point, we'd burned so many calories shivering that we were desperate to eat.  

I ordered the carrot and ginger soup-thank goodness they forgot to charge me for it because it was so sweet that I seemed to be able to taste the sugar granules.  I'm not interested in food that a restaurant has to make so sweet that you can't taste any other flavors.  My quiche was huge...quantity over quality.  The crust was soggy and really just not very good.  The salad had a dressing that seemed to be sprinkled with sugar dressing.  

The servers were nice and the restaurant itself is beautiful but that was about it.Meh.  Pretty forgettable subs.  Jimmy John's and Milio's are better options for delivery.I used to like you Palms.  But I think we have to break up. 
It wasn't very nice of you to charge my card for a deposit on a non smoking room and then shove me in a dingy, smoking optional room in the old tower when I arrive.  I used to sell mortgages so I know all about the bait and switch.  I also know that for what you charge I can get a better experience elsewhere.  And the Ghost Bar kinds sucks these days.  But you know what?  I was still going to check it out until you tried to charge me a $30 cover at 3 am.  Come on.  That's just silly.  I wish you well, Palms, but I think we're better off just being friends.  No more overnights.Well- 2 years later and a name change did not improve my review of the  LVH.  WiFi still 13.00! Mc Donald's WiFi is free!!! Hotel smells old and musty. Buffet was cold and tasteless. The only good things were the Noodle Bar and the monorail stop. Last time staying at LVH!The hotel itself is alright. You have restaurants, the casino, nice rooms... Standard Vegas. I am taking off three stars for their inability to filter white trash from the pool area. It's like every hillbilly and their mother and grandmother decided the LVH pool was the prime get together spot to be vulgar and simply classless....play music that attracts attractive people. Don't play music that attracts an obese hoe down party. Come on DJ!Everything was way overpriced and overrated!

I ordered two orders of Uni Sushi and it costed me $40! Not to mention they weren't too fresh neither. Also tried their Hamachi Kama and it was under cooked, nasty! The special white fish sashimi was probably the best, but too much oil and sauce.

Waiter service was good, nice and quick so two stars go here.

The way they manage takeout order was kind of strange; I can't order from front desk even they had like 3 people doing nothing (just chatting with each others). I had to go over to the bar area and ordered from the bar tender - odd.

Anyway, not coming back.Food is pretty good, but the service is horrible. My waiter could not remember our order. After the meal was finished, he finally brought out my wife's steak. They also consistently forgot to bring drinks. Great name and good food, but they fell short today.Stayed during the week June 18th through June 22nd. Starting with the good. Stayed on the 23rd floor and had a strip view, it had easy access to aria and Bellagio and the casino wasn't good or bad. The pool area looked nice but was way packed mid week so I couldn't even imagine trying to be down there on the weekend. Price wasn't bad on paper but the Internet cord they provide didn't work, the shower had a ton of mildew, the hallway on our floor was always wet. Really wet. The aroma gives you a headache, I would rather just smell the smoke. My wife and I both cut our feet on the tac strip in the room. I called downstairs to let them know about the issues and told them ahed of time I'm not looking for anything free just giving the info, and they were rude. My family and I will be going back to the MGM as soon as the construction is done.My last meal in Vegas was such a disappointment. I stopped by The Palm after lots of walking and was starving. I looked over the menu and ordered the business lunch special (3 course lunch for like $20). The soup of the day was a chowder that was fairly decent but the fresh fish of the day however was drained in sauce that was overpowered by lemon juice. I could only handle a few bites and moved on to my vegetable side which was way over cooked and soggy. I prayed the dessert would be better and it definitely was thank goodness.  The service was nice but was incredibly slow. We had a flight to catch and I had to ask for my ticket three times, boo.Very disappointed, this was my red meat day! My steak was incorrectly cooked 3 times, all the proper apologies were extended and I was not charged, but how can a steakhouse not be able to make a medium rare steak? There are lots of options in Vegas, and now after many years eating at the Palm, I will explore those options.The MGM is decent...I used to stay at Mandalay (my favorite hotel) every time I went to Vegas and wanted to see what MGM was all about...well, it's different...i reserved a non smoking room, and guess what, they put me in a smoking room the first night...called housekeeping and they brought a 1950's air purifier, has a switch that says "smoking to non smoking..." was funny until it kept cutting in and out...looked at where the air filter was and you could see blue sparks!...so i got my room change the next day to a clean smelling room...it was alright, no vents in the bathroom...steamy showers were the norm...view was good though, nothing else that spectacular...pool is alright, but if you guys want a good pool, you have to check out Mandalay Bay's!...no i don't work for them, just a satisfied customer.My friends and I stayed here for reading week feb 16-18 we were a group that ranged in age from 19-25. We got fairly decent rates for our short trip and that is why we stayed here.

Check in/ Check out: We checked in at about 1PM there was a huge line and it moved slowly. We were told we were too early and our rooms were not ready. I have been to Vegas many times and checked in before the designated 3PM time and had to problems. We booked two rooms and were advised to call a number on a card after 3 and to leave our bags with the bellmen which we did. After returning to the hotel after a nice lunch our rooms were still not ready. It was about 4PM by this time, by 4:10 we were able to check into 1/2 of our rooms. The other people didn't get their room until about 5PM. When we complained they didn't offer us anything so we asked for a late check out for that room for no charge and were given it. Check out was a lot easier as we prepaid everything and did not have to deal with any staff members.

Location: MGM Grand is very close to the airport and our cab fare was under $15. It is near the end of the strip, close to Luxor across from NYNY but it's a quick walk to the action part of the strip.

Food: There were a lot of options as are as places to eat, drink etc. There is a great food court located near the Casino that had a great selection like an amazing pizza place and every ones favorite McDonald's. There is also a Starbucks as well. We eat at the buffet on our last day, it had a great selection of food and was fairly cheap $12 I think.

This hotel is huge and has everything you could possibly need but I would not stay here again, there was nothing over the top that would make me want to return.Nice hotel. Terribly slow service at check-in.  Waited 90 minutes!  Uncomfortable bedsWhen we went to check in, it turned out I had made a mistake with the reservation-- I had put my boyfriend's first name, but my last name. Seems like a minor mistake, but the guy checking us in flipped out and even CUSSED AT US. Wow. Nice hospitality... the F word really makes checking in so much easier. The manager ended up coming over and fixing the situation, but check in took forever. Anyways, we stayed in one of the basic rooms. It was tiny but cute looking on first glance. The carpet had a few minor stains that I didn't notice until later. I was grossed out by a brown stain on one of the "under-blankets" (not the bedspread, but the blanket under it). Flatscreen TV was crooked. Bathroom was good size and clean, but there was no fan, so if you like taking long steamy showers, you might have a problem. Housekeeping was constantly on us about cleaning our room. They kept calling our room or knocking on our door, even when we had the privacy sign up. Every morning, the maids would try speaking to my boyfriend in Spanish. Good things about the room included the safe, the full size hair dryer, the iron + ironing board, and the lit magnification mirror in the bathroom (good for applying your show girl makeup before hitting the nightlife).  The casino is attractive, happening,  and the dealers are friendly. I won some good money at the black jack tables & roulette was pretty cool too. However, all together, I would not return to this hotel... it just isn't worth the price.Check-in is very slow. They never heard of express check-out for some reason, so it is slow too. Time costs too much to waste it in lines like this.

Internet didn't work, because of screw up of the front-desk person who checked us in.

As many people mentioned mandatory $20 resort fee sucks.

Breakfast buffet is very good, although it costs $25.

Location is great, rooms are clean and neat. However I would not call it 4 star hotel.

I didn't compare with the other Vegas hotels/casinos, all this is probably common, but it doesn't mean that it has to be like that.I stayed at the imperial palace for my 21st because my broke ass couldn't afford a "better" place. You really do get what you pay for here...the parking lot was RIDICULOUSLY hard to navigate through (i followed all the signs and still managed to go around in circles), and if you didn't get lost in the parking lot, you'd probably get lost trying to find the elevator or your room. 

oh, and someone on our floor vomited early in the night so we couldn't get to our room without a noseful of someone elses yak. needless to say, the smell didn't get any better the next afternoon when it was warmer.

the teahouse [the 24 hour restaurant upstairs] serves okay food for reasonable prices, but make sure you have everything before your server leaves because it'll be another hour until you see him to flag him down. i think that's a trend with all 24 hour restaurants though...especially denny's, but i digress.

the room itself was very spacious, and not as ghetto as i was imagining it to be. 

The location and price are unbeatable...and if you're a cheap college student, the vomit smell and dated furniture are forgivable.do not let them place you in the capri! ITS WAY THE HELL IN THE BACK. we tried so many routes to try to get there and in the end we still went all the way in the back up an escalator down an escalator through a sketchy walkway and somewhere else it was RIDICULOUS. our room/bthrm looked like the person who "prepared it" had lazily wiped a dry wash cloth over everything and had forgotten how to clean anything. It was a big room - with two beds though.

Otherwise, middle of the strip, easy access to everything, MONORAIL!!!!, so cheap we barely believed it, and easy access to cabs. Cool stuff going on next door outside - next to Margaritaville WOO. Inexpensive "tall" drinks at the Fat Tuesdays. Good place to lay your head down when you come stumbling back. And their bar/club/whatever, rockhouse was fun! They also have a great restaurant inside and their room service has big portions. The rewards program is cool - sign up for it if you haven't (it covers caesars, paris, harrahs, IP, and another one). 

Things I liked about the room: Spacious, Has a separate "vanity" from the bathroom that girls can lay out their makeup and hair stuff on, has a rail for hangers and things to put your suitcases on, has an iron + ironing board, has a hairdryer and a shower and running water, two beds so you can stack people in (although there were only two of us), adjoined rooms if you're traveling in a group, center of the strip

Biggest complaints: capri is FAR, no fridge, no microwave, no safe, no free wifi (but probably no free wifi anywhere on the strip), pedestrians are douchebags getting out of IP so you lose money in the cab just waiting for him/her to grow a pair.Obviously, you get what you pay for so I can't really complain.

I just can't get over how dirty the place was and the crowd of people at this fine establishment. The bed sheets had stains that they didn't even bother trying to hide. Majority of the people staying here were over 50 and had soulless eyes, which just made it sad walking through the lobby/casino.

Elevators were crazy slow and most of the ice machines did not work.

But the place is in the middle of the strip, so that's always a good thing.By far the worst hotel on the strip.  The rooms are old, dingy and don't have a fresh smell to them.  I have stayed in Motel 6's that were better.  Trying to find the parking garage was an adventure.  Once you find it, which is off the service road underneath the monorail in the back, it's not too bad, but the trick is to find it!  

There is construction on this road, and if you happen to get a room that is near this area, be aware that construction starts at 5:30am.  We requested a room change for our second night to a quieter room.  The bed was ok, the tv was from then 1990s, the carpet was dirty, but they do have a little balcony that you can get some fresh air.

The one saving grace to this hotel is the location.  Close to the Flamingo, Mirage, Harrahs, Caesars, and the others that are in that area.  Still, as with everything in Vegas it's still a good walk to get to the other places. 

Because we didn't have to pay for the stay at this hotel I can't comment on the price, but I would look elsewhere as I would not pay $20 for this place. This should be the next hotel to be torn down in Vegas.Very loud hookah bar more than a lounge. You can't really carry on a conversation because the music is very loud. Service is terrible, the drink server was hard to get a hold of cause she walks away as soon as she sets your drink down and the music is so loud she can't hear if you're trying to call her back. Hookah service was really bad, had to ask 3 times for a hookah and once we finally got one, the server never came back to adjust the coals.Our room stinks, the sink clogs, the elevators are trashed, but the view is amazing. When we got here there is construction....they should of told us this before coming. We drove around for half and hour.and then walked ten minutes to get to the hotel. I think they put us in a pet friendly room.I recently had the opportunity to visit Vegas and wanted to stay on the strip. This hotel fit the bill in that regard. However, even in an upgraded suite I was not pleased.
This hotel needs some serious updating. Both of our TV's were big tube TV's, the sofa and chair looked like they had been ridden hard and put away wet. They were faded and sunk in in spots. 
This hotel does not offer WI-FI at all, free or otherwise. They do have 'wired' interet that is free. I found this to be a pain. There is a black box attached to the TV that i supposed to have an ethernet cable attached to hook up your computer. Neither of my TV's had the ethernet cord necessary for internet hook up. When Icalled down to the desk, the woman had me pulling both TV's off the shelf to see if there was a cord behind. I told her there was not a cord behind either TV, and she sounded like she didn't believe me. 
Finally she agreed to send someone to check it out. A man came and saw that there was no cord available and hooked one up that he had brought with him.

I found out that any hotel on the strip will loan a wheelchair to someone in need, whether you are a guest of their hotel or not. The Luxor charged a $15 per day fee even as a guest ofthe hotel.

Less than friendly staff!

Also the atmosphere was not as Vegas-y as I would have liked. 

I do not recommend staying at this place.We stayed for two nights.

The GOOD:
Staff was generally helpful and pleasant, including the front desk, security, pool staff, and casino employees. Rooms can be found for fairly cheap.

The casino is rather sparsely populated, and the poker dealers speak constantly about how bored they are and how desperate they are for people to sit down and play. On the upside, this lead to them promoting games with splash pools (the house throws in $25-75 when the flop is a straight, flush, or straight flush). They offer free craps, roulette, and blackjack lessons, and the relaxed and empty game room means that beginners, as well as those simply looking to gamble without much pressure, will find this great place to play.

The BAD:
The building is old, and it shows. The river ride that used to exist is now gone, and no complimentary experiences come with your stay. The "resort fee" is tacked on only as you finish booking with the hotel, so the cost is really about 15 dollars more per night than advertised. As a result, customers are given "FREE!" internet, available only through a single wired connection in the room. The connection speed is decent enough for streaming videos, at least.

The elevators are finicky, with buttons that don't seem to respond and card readers that require more precision with swiping than NASA does with docking at the ISS. The ride is also a bit unnerving for those who have trouble with motion sickness, as they move at strange rates, traveling at a sideways angle (to scale the pyramid's walls).

The rooms are not terribly clean. The towels had stains on them, and there were plastic ties on the floor, as well as a bottle cap by the night stand. The nice thing is that the cleaning staff clearly doesn't want to do its job, so if you leave your stuff strewn all over your room and place a privacy sign on the door, you can be sure that your stuff will remain totally undisturbed by any hotel staff.

The rooms also lack basic amenities, such as coffee makers, and some of what is provided is old and in need of replacement. The hair dryers, for instance, immediately emit a burning smell.

The Luxor has very little to offer. It is a dying hotel that is at the "lesser" end of The Strip. However, for cheap rates on rooms and (relatively speaking) on the buffets, the Luxor's lack-luster offering may be just what you are looking for if you want a quiet, unintimidating home base for your stay in Vegas. It is connected to the Excalibur, which has more offerings for children (carnival games and such). Its location at the end of The Strip makes it easy to access and out of the way of all of the intense city traffic that begins just past the hotel.

That said, these benefits come at the price of being located far away from the excitement of the rest of The Strip, so you'll need to plan on a long walk if you intend to get to see any of the other hotels, and it's about  miles if you plan on going down towards the busier end of The Strip.

Also, the beam is very overrated and unimpressive. Most spotlights are more to look at than the Luxor's beam.I stayed here last weekend with a few friends. It was for a bachelor party, we got a suite and the adjoining room in the East tower. 
-NO WIFI! None. Unless you're in the main lobby, there is zero WiFi in The Luxor. 
-Suite bedroom AC was busted making it literally too hot to sleep in. The staff changed our room which was kind of them. 
-All furniture felt it was one heavy sneeze away from breaking. 
-TV's were old and showed static-y channels. 
-Several beaten up things around the hotel: broken elevator buttons, cracked glassware, rickety elevators, stains on walls, broken door locks, etc. 
-Located on the South end of the strip. If you feels like leaving that area, it's a pain. 
-Seriously rude valet service. 

I have stayed at worse places, but barely. The Luxor is no longer the pinnacle it used to be, and refuses to advance like many other hotel / casinos around it. For the price you're paying, go for the Mid-North (near Treasure Island) part of the strip; same rates,  closer to popular areas, and in better shape. The only reason this didn't get a 1 star is because the main staff were very helpful and courteous.Came to Vegas for a friend's birthday and was stuck in a handicap accessable room (not what we previously booked). Hotel staff wasn't friendly and always seemed distracted. Was kept up until after midnight on 10/20 due to laud music from the hotel pool. We were on the 31st floor, so I can't imagine what the lower floors were experiencing. I called down to the front desk, and their only solution was ear plugs which I already had. Called again, then they blamed the noise on the Four Seasons. No apologies, just a suck it up sort of attitude. Upon checkout, spoke with the manager and encountered the same sort of demeanor. I thought this was supposed to be a nice hotel, but my experience was anything but.So damn bland. The chips were nothing spectacular although i'll admit to the speed at which they were served. The atmosphere was loud and very fitting for the hard rock hotel but everything left me with buyers remorse. Drinks were $12 and for that price - yes, i expect mediocrity. The margaritas were weak. Weaker than weak. What a bummer - because you need to get a buzz going to at least tolerate the tacos which were too soggy to stomach (if they were able to make it into the mouth before falling apart into a pathetic pile of questionable ingredients). Flavors were unspectacular and as my father said "like an expensive version of chilis." Save yourselves the frustration of an costly letdown.I thought Thomas Keller had a good reputation, but it looks like he has resorted to trading on his name like so many of his contemporaries.

Not a very good place, the type that serves mediocre food and survives on their name, undeserved reputation from when maybe they used to be good, and the expectation that their clientele are ignorant and either don't realize or are too proud to admit they were suckered in to getting ripped off at a place like this.

The seafood platter starter was pretty good. Nothing to complain about although not nearly as epic in presentation as, say, Mastro's which really makes it feel like a night out.

For my courses I decided to judge them on a couple of bistro classics, the onion soup and croque madame (a croque monsieur with a poached egg on top). I can make better onion soup than Bouchon--straight up. If Thomas Keller would accept the challenge I would go on Food Network for a cook-off and bury his ass. The soup tasted a bit burnt and too strong overall, my first impression was that someone dumped a double-dose of instant bouillon into the pot by accident. And not enough cheese, which is a major pet peeve. At a nice place, why cut costs by withholding the last ounce or two of cheese that would put the soup ever the top?

Croque madame was served cold, almost completely. Once I started eating I found a little warm spot in the center, but it had definitely been sitting for a while, so I suppose that's why the food took so long to arrive; I should have sent it back but didn't feel like waiting another hour. It was pretty good, definitely would have been better served hot but even so nothing remarkable. The bread was a bit thick and the ham wasn't anything special. The fries were unremarkable, and not consistently cooked which is kind of an unusual problem. A lot of them were a bit undercooked, the rest were fine, but visually they all looked like they came from the same batch. Not as good as McDonald's.

The lemon tart dessert was probably the highlight of the meal, but even so, I occasionally caught a slight stale taste.

Don't bother, go to Chinatown or anywhere else they still feel like they have to work for it.Our second night in Vegas was a much anticipated reservation at Bouchon. We arrived at scheduled reservation and were seated immediately.

The service was not what we'd expected of a fine dining establishment associated with Chef Thomas Keller.

The waiter was appropriate in greeting us and defining menu, he was appropriate in taking our order. Problem, we never saw him again.

The meal was delivered by restaurant staff. We had to communicate thru restaurant staff for the Wine Master service(sommelier title  unknown ), he was appropriate with paring and serving wine, still no waiter.

There was a gentlemen across the dining room, we made eye contact, he approached the table, he knew we were unhappy. I asked what happened to the waiter, he pointed across the dining room indicating he was busy with another table. We were speechless with this response.

There was no reason to debate at this time. We asked for the check, he indicated he could help us with that. Still no waiter....

The lack of training we observed from our experience at Bouchon was not acceptable.

Upon exiting the restaurant we were approached by a female employee"she wanted to make it right". A little to late, the core staff is weak at this establishment.

I will be sending a note to the corporate office of Chef Keller informing him of this situation.

What a disappointment.I'd heard good things about this restaurant but it was really disappointing. The food was fine but it wasn't what it should be for the price. Soup and entrees were okay-- at these prices, they really should be more than okay.to quote a fellow yelp reviewer, "the service was satisfactory just like their food."

bread was cold and butter was not whipped.  dont even remember if it was salted.  

seared foie gras appetizer was decadent, oily, and delicious.  but it was comparable to seared foie gras ive had elsewhere at cheaper places.

the paupiette of black bass had a very nice thin shell but the fish was definitely overcooked.  

chocolate shell dessert was standard.  really expected more from such a high end and high price place.

also didnt like how they didnt have prices on the menu which basically forced us to do prix fixe. 

ive def had better french food at this price point.Ordered a turkey sub on wheat bread with extra tomatoes. Didn't get what I ordered, they skimped on the tomatoes and gave me regular white bread. Called to complain and the manager was like "Oh Well". Wrote to the company and they could care less too. Won't ever be back!Drunk food at 3am as it's the only place open at this hour - awesome taste! Though, poor service, the five, yes, five tables seated after us were served first. Perhaps they had to go out and pick the vegetables for the veggie burgers?

regular dinner take out - great service, but I can definitively say the second worst Pad Thai I've ever had. (worst was in Clayton GA if you are wondering)

Nothing Lucky about 24-7, except the hours of operation. 
ahem, the strip mall across the street also has a 24 hour place, sadly didn't realize until we were leaving.While I was staying at the HRH Tower, I won a meal voucher at Mr. Lucky's 24-7.

We weren't really planning on using it, but on the last day, we decided to check out their breakfast menu since it seemed like the most convenient option at the time - we had very little time left before we needed to leave for SoCal. 

Since I was attempting to cut my calories and focus on consuming more protein-heavy meals, I ordered the  "Gambler's Special," which included a bowl of salad, an 8oz sirloin steak, three jumbo shrimp, and garlic mashed potatoes for $7.77. For the size of the steak I got and the jumbo shrimp, $7.77 is definitely a steal.

Did it taste good? Was it quality food? I don't know. It was definitely a little on the oily side, but I did appreciate that the shrimp was not overcooked. As far as the steak is concerned, It seemed like your regular USDA Select cut of meat, and was a little on the tough side.

Overall.. my expectations were very low, and appropriately so.On a girlfriends birthday we were asked to join her here.  

So we did.  We had a table and were moved to another (no biggie)  We had 4 bottles not a small deal in Vegas Bottle service and as the night went on we got more.  The Bottle service waitresses were awesome (why do I always feel I say that) cuz they usually are.  The moving wasn't a big deal but all of a sudden our bouncers changed as well and these guys were NOT fun or cute or pretty much anything besides annoying.  They kept asking us to move or get off this or get off that while the rest of the place was going nuts. 

My next quip is I needed a bathroom so I asked the largest guy in the room (that would be the bouncer) (right outside my gate to keep the heathens out) where the bathrooms are.  I haven't done anything wrong so I should get a decent answer.  He grudgingly tells me "it's over there" and points to my right, I say "I have to walk all the way over to the other side of the club to go pee?!" "yes" "ok" and I go and go and go through the crazy nightclub crowd I get close to the barrier and finally I see a bouncer a GIRLYES! so i ask her "I need to pee, where is the bathroom?!" "oh you have to be a VIP to use these bathrooms"  I said "I am a VIP my booth is over there he told me to go over here"   she says "nope you have to be a VIP in my section to use this bathroom"  The whole time not looking in my eyes at all.

Are you fricking kidding me?!  VIP bouncers are the worst they think they are in charge and there is no communication they know nothing.  They don't seam to be paying attention because they can't find the bathroom and cannot accommodate a girl who's group just bought 4 bottles (more to come) no we are not 20 but we still look great and we can pay our own way.  I guess it is time to change your name and redo it so you can get a better rating.

BTW it took me 1 hour to pee after paying for 4 bottles of booze no thanks to your bouncers!Good beer, so-so food. My friends love coming here whenever we go to Vegas. The main reason is because everyone prints out a coupon on their website for free beer with an order of any entree. The food here never impresses me. I've been here two times too many. The service is pretty good, but is overshadowed by the bland food.This buffet isn't cheap. They have an "every day brunch" gimmick that drives the price of a breakfast buffet, with beverage and tip, over $20.

The food isn't at all impressive. I liked their hash browned and O'Brien potato variations. I also enjoyed the bread pudding, but that was about it. Other than the potatoes and bread pudding, there is nothing of very good quality at this buffet. So, it seems to be all about eating massive quantities of mediocrity.

For my taste, most of the food lacked flavor. There were some items that were downright wrong. An example of this was the chilaquiles, which were terrible and tasted of vinegar. Much of the food showed evidence of long holding times. A lot of the food was lukewarm or dry, and the eggs were watery.

The service wasn't particularly attentive, either. Perhaps there is no motivation to provide good service since diners pay in advance and are encouraged to tip then.

Because I was at a conference at the Monte Carlo, I ended up going to this buffet twice on a recent trip to Las Vegas. I won't be back: the restaurants in the hotel's food court are better options.When we went to the Spice Market Buffet, it was still the Aladdin a few years ago.  I did a lot of research and reading tons of reviews because the hubby and I were only going to be in Vegas for 4 days - each meal was not to be wasted at a so-so establishment.

The most famous thing in Vegas aside from the casinos and the shows is of course the buffets.  Every corner you turn on the strip, there is some huge neon sign advertising the cheap yet plentiful buffets.

On the higher-end side was the Spice Market Buffet - not much advertisement, it was just supposed to be a "hidden gem".  The price we paid was somewhere along expensive - $20+ for each person for dinner.  This was a fortune in Vegas when it came to buffet dining.  There must be some exotic and delicious food was the conclusion we came to.

The room was dimly lit.  There was plenty of walking room amongst the tables, probably to avoid head-on collisions amongst patrons.

The selection of food was paltry.  They were known to have "international fare" and yet at each of the distinguished stations, they had only a few items.

Now, not only was the number of selections limited, the food they did have was sub-par.  Hot food was warm, cold food was slightly colder than warm.

We were definitely extremely disappointed with our experience here.Came to the Spice Market Buffet for dinner using our buffet of buffets pass. Sadly it was not very good. There is a large variety of food types, but unfortunately most aren't worth trying. The Mexican station was the best, but even that wasn't great it was just far better than everything else! 

On a positive note the line moved very fast and we waited for less than 10 minutes.

If you have the buffet of buffet pass save yourself the stomach space and go to the Paris buffet instead.So crowded...so hot! I knew we were in for it when we both caught ourselves pushing people off us so we can dance. It's sexy and hot. Tao Beach had more room but you're hot with all the hot people of Vegas. I'm glad we didn't have to wait in line long...eat at the Bistro and get the stamp.  
I think it would be cooler if it had 50000 more feet to share but, then that would mean they would let 1 million more people in.I am giving this 2 stars because of the nightclub.  I probably would have given 3 or maybe even 4 for dinner. 

Dinner: Obviously expensive.  We had reservations and still waited 20 minutes.  Maybe this is normal in Vegas but I thought it was crazy when they make you make the reservation, give your credit card number, and then call the day of to confirm. Hello, we are going to come.  My husband and I had the duck and really liked it.  They lure you in by saying you get a wristband for the club if you eat there, but don't tell you that you must purchase a $40-$50 entree to get that band. Service was mediocre.  In all, the food was satisfying. But go for the expensive food, not to get into the night club. 

Nightclub: awful.  If 500 people left, it may have been fun.  You couldn't move, and not in a good way.  It was uncomfortable and not enjoyable at all.  The bartenders were rude.  It took minimum 20 minutes to get a drink.  The drinks were minimum $14. We left after 30 minutes (maximum).  Veryyyy disappointing.I don't see how this place is only $$$ with $88 entrees on the menu, but then I don't think the $$$ range should be $30-60.  Considering that side dishes are extra, unless you are very careful it is going to be easy to blow through the ceiling of $60/person.
  
It is a decent atmosphere, the waiter was good if not a little arrogant, but overall did a decent job.

Although they don't show it on the menu link in Yelp, they had sushi the night we were there.  I had a sushi roll with crab, lobster and jalapeno and it was good.  However, I think $25 for a sushi roll is a bit over the top.  

I do give high marks for the Miso soup. It was probably the best I have had.

One of my dining partners reported that the lobster in their dish was pretty chewy.

The food quality is good, but not blow me away, so I feel value-wise this is a 2 star.So this place is hosted in one of my favorite casinos in Las Vegas, but I didnt have the best meal here. I hate to say that. I came here many years ago and had the endive pecan salad and lamb. It was great and I loved it! I kept thinking for years that I needed to go back and get the same thing. Well I was in Las vegas visiting some friends and surprized my GF.. And we all decided to eat at the Red White and Blue. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with Mash Potatoes. I was HUGELY disappointed! It was cold and felt like it was under a heat lamp for hours! Plus the mash potatoes were hard and tasted like a mix and water mixed together. It pretty much looked like mass production being served. The staff was really friendly so I dont fault them there, but i was really disappointed with the food. I am sorry to say, but Ill give them 2 stars to just say it was edible but not the best and if you are going to vegas for a good time. I would skip this place. Next door is a china place and another great cafe.. Go to those instead! ok i hope im not banned from the THE HOTEL :)A couple days ago, I came here for an early lunch with Donald. We had a coupon for $6.99 lunch that was good for up to four people. They open at 11am Mon-Sat and it was only 11:15am when we got inside. When we started going down the salad bar, I couldn't help but notice that everything looked like it was just uncovered from the night before. A lot of the salad was limp and majority of the toppings were almost empty. Considering they just opened 15 minutes before, it shouldn't have looked like that at all. In fact, one would think we would be getting the best of everything because it should all be newly stocked. That just wasn't the case here...

We looked at the menu online beforehand to make sure they had soups that we would like. The main reason why I wanted to go was for the Cream of Broccoli and Sweet Tomato Onion, so after eating some salad I went to load up on soup. I saw French Onion, chili, Cream of Broccoli, Turkey Noodle, Dill Potato, and Split pea. What was missing? The Sweet Tomato Onion!! Apparently they just don't follow their menu that's posted online because the Tomato Onion and Chicken Noodle were missing, but they had Dill Potato and French Onion, which weren't even on their online menu.

The only thing I really liked about my experience here the other day was that it was easy to find booth seating right next to the soup/pasta section because it was very early on a weekday, but that's not enough of a bonus to add another star.Meh is right

I had high expectations.  It smelled delicious from the outside.

I love thin crust pizza.  I love fresh ingredients.  I love brick oven pizza.  I should have LOVED this place.

Unfortunately, I thought it was the epitomy of bland.  

I got a small pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms.
The toppings were not evenly spread across the pizza.  In fact, half of the pizza had no pepperoni and a few pieces of sausage on them?! (I hate sausage on pizza, blech)

The sauce was sooo bland to me.  

The cheese almost had the consistency of low-fat cheese when it melts... like... rubbery.

Yep.  I won't come back.Great selection. Nice atmosphere. Loved the ice cream sandwiches you can have them make. Also the omelets you can have them make. Besides that every thing is average. Exotic names. But quality was just so so. I tried everything, tHe only thing that was ok was the fried chicken breaded in a maple pancake dough or something. That was definitely different. It was free with our hotel. But if you have to pay it is way too much. It is like 86 for too people that is crazy. I think they price it high to keep people who are not from the hotel out.Went during the Christmas Holiday to New Year's time period so Sunday Brunch was about $40 a person. Was it worth it? No. Maybe because I'm not a breakfast food person and most of the food were breakfast items. The line went pretty quickly. We were in line, paid, and seated within an hour.

They had a bagel station, shrimp cocktail, sushi area, Asian inspired food, create your own omelette station, carving station, create your own eggs benedict station, Mexican inspired food, breakfast pizzas/pastas, cheese/breads, oatmeal, and salads.

I got to try their smoked salmon which was nothing special. Prime rib was pretty salty, but they cooked it medium so not as pink as I would have liked. Plenty of shrimp cocktails, but how could you mess that up? Eggs benedict was a fail. You have a choice of lobster, original, and other choices, but they ran didn't have lobster or canadian bacon so you only had the choice of pork loin. Why ask me what I want if that's all you have! I ate a bite and threw it away. They had a congee (Asian porridge) station as well which I thought was pretty cool, but it wasn't hot at all, it was like room temperature...

As for the desserts, I was expecting something spectacular! However, I was pretty disappointed. They have 2 sides of desserts and they were all basically repeats. They have a small selection of cakes, ice cream, and other stuff. The only thing that stuck out to be was the passionfruit tapioca, but I just scrapped off the passionfruit and ate that.

Service:
Our server was friendly to everyone else, but us. Took awhile to take the dishes away. Took awhile to refill our glasses and wouldn't even bother if we didn't ask. Most likely won't be dining at this buffet again...Come closer to dinner time. That's when they brought out the snow crab legs, oysters, and lamb chops!Was there for my bachelor party back in 2008, ok food, they were 45 minutes late in seating us.  They also pushed 2 round tables together which made people have to sit in a gap.  I had fun just because I got drunk but otherwise this place sucked. I hope that since then FIX got fixed.We have the sliders at the Fix every time we are in Vegas. Really enjoy the simplicity of it and usually very consistent. That being said, this place is way overpriced for the value and the wait staff leave a lot to be desired. We have actually had the same waiter twice now and both times he has been less than stellar. Considering the atmosphere and location this is not much of a problem, but with the plates as expensive as they are??? Menu also could stand more updating and larger selection.Came here expecting a fine dining experience but ended up being very underwhelmed.  We both ordered from the pre-theater menu; in addition, I ordered the wine pairing.  The wine pairing was a big mistake... I'm not a wine snob, but i actually had to request a different glass be brought out since one of the glasses of wine had a funky smell to it.  The quality of wine pairing was mediocre at best.

Overall the food was just ok.  I had salad for appetizer, filet for entree, and root beer float for dessert.  Everything was reasonable but nothing stood out.  Well, the cookies that came with the float were pretty good.  But that's not really what I came here for.

I think the biggest disappointment was that our server didn't seem very experienced.  He couldn't really describe the dishes that well and ended every description with "It's really good".

It just didn't live up to my expectations having dined at Bellagio before (Aqua) and having a fantastic meal.I don't get the draw?  The show was slow.  Not quite as entertaining as I would have expected after hearing all the hype.  Seemed like there were die hard fans there?  They seemed to know what was coming next and ready to laugh,... I don't get the draw.  I suppose I should have had a bunch of drinks prior?  But then, as slow as the show was,... I would have probably been sleeping at some point.  Ticket price was crazy for that poor of a show.  I wouldn't go again or recommend.I should preface my review by saying that my breakfast here came after waking up still drunk from the night before.  Rather than pile on the gluttony at the very nice buffet, I wanted something simple and easy, so I picked the Terrace Pointe Cafe.  The service there was nice, friendly and congenial and they were good at everything but serving the food.

I had the eggs benedict.  The dish was unremarkable.  The sauce was fine, the poached eggs were just alright, the muffin was burnt.  The potatoes seemed like they were designed by a chef trying hard to deliver something nice, but again they were unremarkable.  I would rank the good ol' Grand Slam breakfast on a par with what I got at the Terrace Pointe and if you're in the Wynn Hotel, that ain't good enough.Over priced, over wrought, over hyped, and under performing.  The food is OK but nothing to brag about.  Everything on the menu outperforms the meat.  

There are a great number of places that I would go first to fulfill my protein desires.

For an equal, if not better, view of the fountains go to Picasso!This place has an awesome steak and ahi tuna! But sad to say THEY GAVE MY PARTY  a HORRIBLE service! my experince with prime was 7 years ago and i couldnt shake off the horrible memory.. We were celebrating for my friend who was leaving for the navy, i give the ambiance a 4 star and the food a 4 star. everything was pricey but worth every bite. The thing i did not like most was the service! Just because our party was young and we did not order bottle service the waiter decided to ignore us! After we left the restaurant we approaced the person in charge and told them how horrible the service was. all he said was " what can i do to make it right" , like all he cared about was giving us comps thinking we were these snooty little rich kids who just wanted to complain. All we said was NOTHING we just wanted to inform you, because our intentions was not to get anything for free we just wanted to inform the person in charge of the horrible waiter... Would I dine again at PRIME? perhaps i really did enjoy their food and Prime Patio is to die for giving you an awesome view of the fountains as you sip on your coffee..Overall, the Cafe at Monte Carlo is an underwhelming establishment. I came by for an intended quick breakfast only to find the service slow despite the restaurant a little under half full.

I had a full carafe of coffee, decently priced at just $3, though the coffee was mediocre at best. For my main entree, I chose the Southwest skillet. The presentation was great, which made the actual taste of the food disappointing. The bacon was way too crispy and burnt and the potatoes were very near inedible.First of all, $16-$19 for tacos I have to assemble myself?  The kitchen only slaps stuff on a plate and the rest is up to you.  The tuna tasted fishy and the pork was flavorless.  The only thing that saves this place from getting one star rating is the corn tortillas.  Also, only 4 beers on tap?  The best is that they offer valet parking.  You could give them your car and watch them drive it 5 feet to park it in one of the spots in front of the door.  Or, you could suck it up and walk another 10 feet and park it yourself.  

I really want to like this place, but just don't get all the high ratings.  Maybe anything tastes good when it is 115 degrees out.I won't bitch about the drink prices because its a damn club and well, thats the price. Mind you I am from NYC and don't even blink at $16-$20 drinks at the gramercy hotel or gansevoor...which i guess explains why my ass is broke...hmm...anyway, I digress. 

So as I said, I won't bitch about the drinks but $40cover????? WTF. I should've applied my rule: if a club charges an exuberant cover or ANY cover, its gonna suck. 

We got there at around 5am, it was so bad that 4 of my 6 friends left as soon as we all walked in. But I was really hammered and ended up staying till 8am. Why? No idea but in the span of those 3 hours I've never seen so many coked out, E dropping people ever. EVER.

I remember some woman (read: not a young attractive girl) handing out mini-snickers bars and hershey's kisses. 

So think about this:
I've just paid $40 to get into this dark ass place, I can't hear my friends bitching and telling me they are leaving, now in my drunken hands are two pieces of chocolate handed to me by a 60yr old woman in a club. WTF???? And no I did not eat the chocolates. I didn't throw them away either as when I woke up at the hotel i had melted chocolate in my pockets and all over some dolla dolla bills. 

I'm a hip hop head but appreciate house and some trance so I was feeling the music. Its the crowd that put me off. Just not my kinda crowdCall before you go for dinner to see if they actually serving "dinner". I arrived for dinner to be told that it was only a buffet. The wait staff was unsure 'when' or 'if' it will ever return to a regular menu for dinner. The buffet table was too short for the number of people seated in the restaurant. The line was almost out the front door to get food. As for the food- mediocre. Food seems to lose its quality when plopped into a gallon pan. The nan bread was dry and some of it was burnt. Hopefully the food would be much better served as a dinner.So, it was 7:22 a.m. on the first Saturday of 2008 when we walked into Matt's Big Breakfast.  The place was maybe half full when we were taken to a table for two with a seat on the side.  A friendly waiter came by for drink orders; I went with apple juice but was later informed they were out.  The whole order went a little something like this, 2 coffees, 1 milk, 1 waffle, 1 cakes, and 1 special of ham eggs green chili and cheese scramble.  I hear the coffee was drinkable.  The waffle and pancakes had somewhat of a buckwheat taste but not sure if that is what they actually were.  I am a huge fan of Belgium waffles and found myself terribly disappointed.  I see a Belgium waffle as having a slight crisp of an edge and a soft center.  This waffle was very soft with no crisp and almost like a moist sponge.  The special was not the best and the pancakes seemed pretty heavy.  The home fries seemed like they were cooked in bacon grease and maybe sat there too long.  I did like the small quaint feel of the restaurant.  All of the staff was very friendly and worked together.  People of all styles came for breakfast, there were regulars, people in a hurry for the airport, couples, families, singles, people of all kinds.  They all were all asked, "How is the food?"  They all seemed to enjoy.  At the places prime they could probably seat 24 people, give or take.  I will probably not be one of them, but I am glad I was one once.And to think I loved this place as a tourist. Whenever I'd visit Phoenix I'd eat at Encanto. Now that I live here, you can't pay me to go. The food is average at best -- especially considering the prices -- and the duck pond is nothing short of disgusting. 

Besides, if you have kids (like I do) you're almost required to take them to feed the ducks which means you're walking through what the ducks (ahem) leave behind. Multiply that times 100 and imagine what the restaurant's floor is covered in. I'm just saying.My husband and I stopped in here to grab a quick bite just to hold us over until our Cirque show was finished.  Hubs got a piece of pepperoni pizza and I got a fruit salad.  The fruit salad was good, very fresh with yummy pineapple, strawberries, blueberries, etc.  My hubby's pizza was a greasy mess!  It looked so nasty, I can't believe he ate it.  He did use several napkins to blot the grease, but that didn't seem to help.  The crust was also burned to a crisp so he almost chipped a tooth on that!  All in all, if you don't really care what you're eating, go for it.  If you want a solid piece of pizza, look elsewhere.I have been around the buffet block a few times so I know what is good and not so good. My sweetheart of a friend Sue decided to treat me to this buffet so we could get our fill of crab legs!

The hot crab legs were a tasty treat and once I got the hang of cracking I was on my way to butter crab soup heaven!

The downside of this buffet is the selection really, they have a star like crab legs and the rest of the food options are just mediocre.

I had two rounds of salad because the selection of items was limited and I rarely get repeats at a buffet. A lot of the food was just not visually appealing, a lot of it looked dry as if it had been sitting for a very long time. 

My friends got a serving of prime rib, it was overcooked, tough and dry unfortunately.

The desert bar was good, I did get my fill of Gelato and cupcakes :) I forgot to snag some cotton candy to take home as I had thought about previously. However they were not making it and you know out of sight out of mind. They have the cotton candy machine there however they are not really making it unless someone request it. They have plastic bags so I don't understand why they don't make a few bags for people to pick up. 

Word of advice, if you don't plan on getting your fill of crab legs on your visit then go to a different buffet as there is simply not enough of a selection to be able to get your fill or moneys worth. 

Anyhow the crab legs and dessert made my night, everything in between is just a plain and simple blur. It was a real treat and I enjoyed the experience with my friends.

That don't impress me much...Food was very disappointing and not good. Definitely will not come back here. Would suggest trying somewhere else. For 31$ a person...even my freakin 10 yr old, omg, really. Only thing i liked was crepe station and the desserts. A 140 bucks for family of four is ridiculous plus variety and selection sucked. Go to Rio...trust me...Just to be upfront here... American expensive over-hyped. It's not bad for tourists coming to Las Vegas I'm sure. But it's American touristic over-hyped foods. But you can expect the same across the Strip here.

My good Caucasian friend wanted to show off his favorite place. Thanks J. He had a few favorite items not found elsewhere. He loved the baked BBQ buns with sweet crust and almond fried shrimp ball especially.

It's located in Bellagio. So it was crowded with Asian tourists. The staffs spoke Cantonese. The service was great. One of the best service in USA... just a bit shy of those 4-star restaurants in Hong Kong.

I know exactly what to expect before I came here with my friend. So I can't really trash the foods here. So this was just my observation.

The foods were pricey. I didn't try the regular menu. It started from $14.95 and up. The appetizer was $7.95 and up. Side orders like preserved duck egg, starting at $3 each. My take? They are all 2-3 times the price of regular restaurants in Las Vegas. You can read my "tasty" reviews on other Las Vegas restaurants too.

So, here's the breakdown:
Service: 4 (they were all eager to help, from push cart servers to our server Denny; very efficient and friendly)
Pu-er tea with chrysanthemum: 3 (good, $2 each person)
Siu Mai: 2.5 (not the best cut of meat here... too chewy with fatty meat; or not minced with the right cut of meat)
BBQ bun: 3 (2 per plate; small size; it's BBQ pork pun, my friend had to order 2 plates to satisfy)
Shanghai Dumpling: 0.5 (3 little one on tiny aluminum shell; $6.95 for 3; minimal juice inside; I could tell it tasted like Shanghai dumpling).
Chicken feet: 3 (Well done, easy to suck off the bone; a bit too sweet... my friend commented that they didn't have to alter the "taste" because most Caucasians won't even look at it; server brought it to me from the kitchen and not on the cart).
Egg tart: 3.5 (crispy shell)
Price: 1 ($3.95, $3.95; $4.25; $4.95; $5.95...)

So diners, you've got an easy choice. Lifestyle of the rich and famous? or Chang's Dim Sum?I came here for a birthday party in June and I expected a lot more coming from this name. Maybe it's because we went with a large party of over 10 and we had to get the tasting menu so it wouldn't be confusing. EVERYTHING had foi gras, including the dumplings, soup, every course. The dessert might as well had it too. The ambiance is really really small with only a few tables and a bar seating area so you can watch the chefs prepare your meal I suppose. I definitely won't want to check out Joel Rubuchon The Mansion if this one was not up to par.I won't go back. Living 10 minutes away and having heard from one other person about how great it was, we tried it. The food was dry and overcooked the first time. We gave it a second shot, knowing that not every day can be a perfect day for them--it wasn't any better.

The wait staff left a lot to be desired too. We felt snubbed, and I'm not sure why the wait staff acted the way the did, but there was no excuse for it.  We made that clear when we left our tip and I even left them a note.  

Here's the deal:  I'm FROM the South. I've lived in Texas, Alabama, and Georgia. I know good BBQ when I taste it and this place was a not a place I want to remember. The restaurant looks nice and is furnished appropriately for a BBQ joint, but it goes no further than that.My friend really talked this place up so I was excited to try it, but we both walked out disappointed. I had the Chicken Italiano which is marinated chicken with provolone, spinach, and grilled onions.  This portion of the sandwhich was actually really good, but the bread was awful!  It seemed like it had been pulled out of a freezer. My friend was also disappointed in his cheesesteak, inside and out. The fries were quite tasty though :)  For $9 a sandwich, give me fresh bread!24 hour Korean bbq.  What could be better than that?  

oh... I dunno...one that actually cooks good food?  Maybe it was because they just didnt' care at midnight...but this whole idea of pseudo buffet was not really that good.  Hubby had kalbi...and for the price it was, well... you should of seen his face... The soondubu kind of wannabe was not very tasty... and honestly only the bibimbap was ok.  This is not saying much as we were ALL FAMISHED by this time. For the food to be less than ok at this time of night when we were really hungry says alot.  

Lack of attention to service, just overall odd. 
I hate to say it wasn't good, but this is just not worth it. 
Maybe they had an off night, but I wouldn't go back.  
Not when I've had better Korean food in Vegas.  And not when there are so many other awesome places to eat at... for better prices and taste!Food is good for the most part. Service not bad. Lots and lots of different beers.
Now let's get to the stupid part of this place. Grab a seat at the bar, order a little food and a beer. They ask that you pay first. They won't do this if you sit in a booth or at a table. But in a hardly-anyone-there-at-ten-on-a-Saturday-night:  hand over a credit card or pre-pay? Nobody. I mean nobody in Scottsdale that even resembles a classy place does this. I'm not talking about The Mint crazy bar scene where it is reasonable to ask for the plastic to start a drink tab. Not even Denny's asks for cash first before food delivery. Idiotic.
Also, lots of TVs but don't get too caught up in one thing because they like their soccer in there and they will change the channels without warning. The good sport you might be watching can easily turn into mostly bright green pixels with shirtless and  knee-grabbing Euros trying to score what would be about the third goal ever successfully made in the history of that sport.
Want a great sports bar, one mile away? Go to Zipps on Camelback. Down to earth, friendly, great food and easily 2/3 the price of the Out House.I don't know what I was expecting when I got a bus all the way down the strip to check out some rides.

Don't get me wrong, there's some awesome rollercoasters in here, well they look awesome. I didn't go on because I was over-run with children. That basically means that I reached my child quota for the day and there's only so much squealing I can take before I run for the hills screaming myself.

There are a range of games that you can play. From the usual throwing balls, hoops and other assorted items to win prizes. There are the lazer tag ones (which I thought was a great inclusion btw!) and there was a batman one, however I couldn't figure out what the game actually was.

The toilets were a wee bit hard to find. It was tucked off in some underground bunker kind of deal. They were clean at least, so one can't complain too much.

For an indoor theme park they didn't do too badly.

Might have to revisit when I'm actually feeling 100% with ear plugs to see if I can't try any of the rides. This might up my star value by one.

It's free to get in however you pay per ride or game. There are all day passes you can get or you can go one ride at a time.OK, I guess I should admit up front that I must be an aquarium snob. I just thought this was OK. I grew up a short drive away from the National Aquarium in Baltimore and am a huge fan of it as well as the Monterey Bay Aquarium and the Texas State Aquarium. This, in comparison, was not that great. However, given that it is in Vegas and is something other than a show, gambling or a restaurant, it fit the bill of a welcome activity that wasn't the "norm." The visit took about 30 minutes...would have liked the glass in the tanks to be a little cleaner, but enjoyed the ability to touch the sting rays. Wouldn't make a special trip just for this, but was good for a little break from the Vegas norm since I was in the Mandalay Bay Resort for a conference.Empty glasses came out (with the orange juice caraffe) COMPLETELY dirty. Food leftovers in them and LOTS of it. Very gross. Makes you wonder what the water glasses really looked like that came out pre-filled and just how sanitary everything is that comes out of the dishwasher!

Vegetarian eggs benedict was quite blah, toaster muffin was soggy from the get-go. The boys weren't crazy about their meals, they were just ok as well. Nothing special here.

I love strong flavors, personally. I season the heck out of my hash at home, but the potatoes really are over kill. I couldn't finish them.

Pretty disappointed. Only notable GOOD things were quick seating outside & decent prices.Such a disappointment...... I stopped in today for an early dinner while visiting Scottsdale. I have tried Fleming's before and had solid meals.

I ended up eating in the bar which almost requires a flashlight to see the menu. If the tv wasn't on, I would have needed my cell phone to see anything.

The service was fine. The bartender was attentive, nice.

I ordered several apps. They all were sub par. The first was barely lukewarm. The second one, pork belly, had potential. You could tell part of the plate was put together and was waiting for the pork belly. I didn't want to tell the bartender they were 0 for 2. The calamari showed up. It was warm but very overcooked in a puddle of some sweet sauce.

The meal did fill me up but if i had to do it over again, I would try a different place.

Plenty of parking outside..Is this the only museum in Las Vegas? !! Why are people giving high reviews when it's boring and pricey ?! 

I went to both the museum and Area 51. It was a lot of reading and text than artifacts and pictures. I got so bored. 

Expect to see A lot of rocks and tiny  metal pieces cased in a glass containers then a large amount if text to go with it. 

Only good thing was there was a few film clips. Not worth the money or the time .I was really excited to go check this place out because I've heard great things about it. The interior was very cute and loved the music, it was very Italian. However, I was a little disappointed with the food. I got the Cesar salad to start off with and thought it tasted funny, but was then told by our server it was because there's anchovies in the dressing. That would've been nice to know ahead of time  in case someone is allergic to fish, plus I wouldn't have ordered that salad then. I didn't enjoy my steak Gorgonzola either, which I think has the anchovies in thy sauce too, because that did not taste as good as it sounded in the menu. I won't be going back anytime soon.Went here before seeing O. It was on the other side of the hotel from the show. Ordered the roll call (taste of their 4 sushi rolls) and yellowtail sashimi. Both were fishy and poor. Had a few other items which were unremarkable. The table next to us didn't seem to enjoy their food either. Waiter was nice. I would never recommend this place.Service ok. Food meh. Drinks ok. The food here has never impressed me. The setting is good.We usually like PF Changs but something about the orange chicken - we got another order, explained to one of the partner's Peter that it was too tomato based vs orange glaze - still wasn't right the 2nd time but we just took it home and put it in the fridge.  they didn't charge us for it and were gratious - oh well, just an of night I suppose.It's the Phantom, if you've seen it, you've seen it. The theatre here is phenomenal, however the smoke from the casino was very much a part of the ambience. It didn't seem to affect the singers, so maybe I am being a big crybaby about it. The Phantom wasn't a great singer, and in contrast to the excellent vocal performances by Christine and Raoul he really stood out as mediocre. The chandelier was over the top Vegas style, but the big drop was weak, very weak. I say replace the mediocre Phantom, throw in a bigger sound or light effect for the chandelier drop and you'll have the best Phantom ever, but right now it's just "meh" with some shrugging shoulders.Not a fan of this place. The portions are large, but the food is not good. So bigger is not better here. Biscuits are tasty and service is pretty good. The only thing I've ever come for is breakfast, but I'd prefer a buffet to this place. Stay away from the salmon, it was so bad and smelly. Stick to breakfast if you do come.The Top of the World Restaurant .. dot dot dot...

Came with a huge party to celebrate a birthday on a Saturday night.  The restaurant was not very busy which makes sense for the current economy and the prices of this restaurant.  Besides their amazing view and outstanding service, this place was maybe on top of the world but certainly not on top of their food.  I can describe this experience as cafeteria food in the elegant setting.  The sixty something dollars I spent here would've been better spent going to the terrace upstairs and riding the rides.  

I ordered the Kurobuta Pork Chop which was, again, something I could probably get at  a hospital's cafeteria for less than $7 but instead I paid 6 times more that amount.  Which by the way, they charge minimum $50 per person since they include the "ride" to see the view.  The only thing that was good was the sweet mashed potatoes.  I actually enjoyed the pork chop's sauce with the sweet mashed potatoes more than with the dry flavorless pork chop.  The sauce had a sweet and spicy kick that didn't overwhelm the dish.

The service however, outstanding!  Top notch.  Our server has to be one of the best servers I've had.  I forgot his name but he had interesting eyebrows.  He knew the entire menu and did not leave our side the entire time.

Here's my recommendation if you're reading this.  Eat at the Stratosphere's food court (or somewhere else besides this restaurant) and take your date upstairs to enjoy the amazing view.  You will not regret this as much, TRUST ME.  Actually, there's a very cool bar on the second floor where you can enjoy the view too.  Do not eat here though.  I tried other plates from the rest of my party and nothing really had a great taste considering their prices.

1 Star for the food, 5 stars for the location and the service.I believe in 2nd chances! Ordered the Barbecued Chicken for take-out. It was so dry I fed it to my dogs and ate the 3 day old Albertson's Barbecued Chicken in my fridge. You know it tasted fresher and better! Corn Muffins were good though.I love a good country song but I do not love this bar and grill.  The prices are very high for the portions you get.  Everything I have tried has been bland and overcooked.  The restaurant makes the big mistake made by many similar chains.  It tries to do too much.  There are far too many items on this menu for the staff to be able to get them all right. The real Toby Keith's in OK have smaller menus and better quality.  This is the PBR tourist trap and has almost no character.    Many better choices in town.It is, what it is: a very commercial, country bar. Highlights were the fried bologna sandwich. Lowlights were: most everything else. In fairness: I had no business being here.On a saturday evening they had 2 people working at the bakery/pastry/gelato counter and I remember my last weekend in Vegas was the same too. They should get another register on that side and at least one more person, especially on a saturday. 

I bought a croissant and their Parisian Blend coffee. The croissant wasn't even as great as a grocery store croissant. I'd had a cheese danish last time and I remember it was amazing. To me it seemed more Euro-style (rich and heavy on the butter, great texture). The coffee was probably the worst I've ever had actually, sour and old. I threw it out and refilled from another of the dispensers and that one was actually palatable, although still shamefully weak and tasteless. 

A place like this - although touristy and 'fake Paris-y' - should at least deliver on their staple stuff like coffee and croissants. I'd only return if I have to.This place is a mixed bag in terms of style, quality, and consistency.  We used to go for happy hour when it first opened and the sushi was worth every penny.  A few trips back for regular dinners over the past few months has left me pretty disappointed.  The atmosphere, especially in Cave Creek, somewhat makes up for what the food lacks.  But the prices are far above what one would expect for the quality one gets.  A dinner this week resulted in a $24 seared ahi entree being sent back twice (first time cooked all the way through and the second time just touched the grill for about 2 seconds)... they never did end up getting that right, along with a list of many other things the waiter and young staff just couldn't deliver on.  Consistency is key and Ten doesn't have it.  Gamble and you may end up with a decent dinner.My last flight through PHX brought me to El Bravo, as usual; but this time I found the prices slightly lower and the quality much less than usual. The bean and cheese burrito, my usual standby, was much smaller and, sadly, made with canned beans. Huge no-no. Glad I'm not traveling for a while....First, the good - the Pan Roast is amazingly good, and the service is friendly and efficient.

Now the bad - the LONG wait, and the inability and unwillingness of the Palace Station to improve things.  I understand that this is a bar with limited seating, but several things can be done to make the customer experience better.  Do we (or our representatives) really need to stand in a line?  How about investing a few dollars in those electronic devices that buzz when its your turn, or if you don't want to spend the money, how about just writing the name down on a piece of paper?  If I don't have to stand in line, where do you think I'm going to go? Thats right, I'm going to be gambling at those slot machines that surround the bar and likely make the Palace Station some money.  But no, according to a Palace Station staff member, the management likes the lines and has no interest in improving things.

And lastly, some tips:
1. Call ahead to see how long you will have to wait
2. Go during off-peak times, and remember 1 AM is not off-peak in Las Vegas
3. If you get sick and tired of standing in line, like we did, go to the Grand Cafe.
4. Watch out for those pesky representatives - one person in line in front of you could actually be holding a spot for a large group of people.Place is ok. This place has a combination of Thai, Malaysian, Filipino, and Chinese on the menu. The food is not that great if your Chinese/Filipino. I've had better authentic dishes elsewhere. 

The place was not kid friendly at all. We went here with our 20 month old and it felt like the servers wasn't aware we only had 30 or so minutes to eat and go. They were really laid back and took their time to attend and check there guess. Also, the eating area was very quiet, if your kid screams or fusses, everyone will literally turn their heads and the music will stop. 

Overall, I don't recommend this place for anyone taking their kids here. Place has a more dating atmosphere and are generally for people that aren't aware of good Asian food. I think would of rated this place a 3 star if the servers were a little more attentive.I have intentions of updating this review eventually.  This place was on my radar for 2 main reasons, its proximity to where I live and the reviews on Yelp.  As I have been trying to check out every dive and diner within walking distance, I found the time last night to try this place out.   The reviews on here were mixed,  I walked in with anticipation but little expectation.   I walk in and see one table for two to my left in a very open entry way...taken.  I go to the bar see only one open chair...taken.  I look in to a side room.  Tables taken.  Investigating further back I see a LAAARGE Table...now when I go out to a bar I am looking to socialize, if I had been with a friend I would have taken a seat and enjoyed myself, but as I was rolling solo, the idea of sitting alone on a LAAAARGE table was admittedly sad.  So I didn't even stop and walked straight out the back door, down the alley and into another local joint.  
Now if they had one more table for 2 in the front along the other wall I would have stayed. or if there had been a small group at the large table I would have asked to join in.  But sadly that wasn't the case.Macaroons are great, the one I had today was a little over filled but still great flavor! I was however extremely disappointed... I ordered the Greek Caesar with chicken - the chicken add was 2.95 for deli slices chicken. The atmosphere has a great feel but they need to turn the a/c on...We went here because we were staying at the Mirage and were too lazy to go anywhere else.  As far as the Las Vegas destination-buffets go, this is not a good one.  The food quality and presentation are significantly below the level of the competition.  That being said, the $25 cost for Sunday all-you-can eat and drink Champagne buffet is actually pretty cheap.   And after a few glasses of Champagne, the food really isn't that bad ... it's the "beer goggle" effect. only with food!i'm really not sure why this place got so many stars.  i've been to quite a few spas, and this one is way overpriced and the experience was mediocre.  i got the chai tea body mask treatment, which starts off with a grape seed body scrub.  you know, if i spend $210 on a treatment, don't get cheap with me on the products.  the lady had like 5 grains of sand on her hand, and was trying to exfoliate me.  i bet walking around in skinny jeans has more of an effect than this.  she tells me that it might get cold, but they can't heat the chai tea mask because it'll dry out.  so turn on the chair warmer!  i dunno if it was not an option, but i was uncomfortably cold the whole time.

after the scrub, she brushes on the chai tea mask, again with the stinginess.  lady, do you pocket the rest of the product and sell it on the street or something?  while she was working on my front, she folded up a towel and placed it under my head, but after being on my back for a while it started hurting my head and neck.  i'd like my $210 back, please!  she finished me off with a vanilla bean lotion, but i was so freezing cold at this point that i jumped right into the spa after the treatment was done.  brrrrrrrr!

a few minutes later my friends were done with their treatments, so we decided to check out the steam room.  it was so steamy in there that you couldn't see 2' in front of your face.  then this lady comes in and leaves the door slightly open.  she gets up to close it, but doesn't close it all the way again.  this time she's too lazy to get up and close it again, so after giving her the evil eye, i get up to close it.  she said: "oops, i'm sorry.  was it not closed?"  ya, right lady, like you didn't know :P  after about 15 minutes it got too hot, so we went to chill out in the arctic room, which i thought was the best part of the spa.  it looks like a cute little igloo inside, and even has "snow" (it's really foam) drifting down from the ceiling.  after sweating buckets in the sauna, we chilled out in the arctic room again.  i want one!The food was good. The service sucked! Our server 'Ceasar' was super nice when he first came to the table. However after our entrees were delivered, that was the last time we saw him. I have never, ever....ever been somewhere that let's a beer glass go completely empty. Let alone a glass of tea, which both happened. The busser actually filled my husband's tea, and another server came and offered us boxes. Then I was finally offered a 2nd beer after I was about 97% done with my meal.
It is a shame, because the menu was inventive. We would have tried other items, like we were going to order dessert, but due to the neglect we will not be returning.I used to love this studio.  It's very pretty, some of the instructors are good, and they do all seem to really care.  

What dropped this down to a 2 star review for me is the scheduling.  Yes, they offer tons of classes.  So how is it I can never seem to get to the class or instructor I want?  I'll rearrange my week (I schedule my time down to the hour), only to find the schedule changed after I figure everything out.  Also, some of the instructors are fantastic, but a couple of the best ones have left, leaving some who's classes I prefer to avoid.  If anyone knows where Dominique went, please let me know!!

What finally pushed me over the edge is the cancelling of the kettlebell and Zumba classes for 3 months.  Those are my favorite classes, especially with it being so hot out.  I really don't care to do hot pilates or yoga during the summer.  Now I've got this monthly fee for a membership that has no value to me.  I really wish I had just bought a 10 class pass or something like that.  

Also, depending on the time you go, the classes are SUPER crowded.  These guys run groupons like crazy, so you get lots of beginners packing it in.  If you're looking for individual attention or to avoid getting someone else's sweat on you, you're probably out of luck.  

Bottom line - do not sign up for the annual membership.  The studio, schedule, and instructors you see now will not be the same in 6 months or a year.  Go with a monthly or drop in rate, so if you become dissatisfied you can easily cut your losses.the fillet Mignon fajitas were not very good, the atmosphere is really cool though.It's hard to find a truly good Mexican food restaurant in Vegas, being Mexican and having tasted true Mexican food might set my standards a bit too high but I believe this is another example of a restaurant that just can't get Mexican food right. I've been here twice and the food ranged from extremely disappointing to mediocre. I tried the fajitas and the shrimp burrito the first visit there. The fajitas were nothing special and the shrimp burrito, which was very large, only had four shrimp in it. Four shrimp in what looked like a pound and a half sized burrito! I shouldn't have to start an expedition into the burrito to find the illusive shrimp. This just won't cut it, I was basically eating a bad salad wrapped in a tortilla trying to pass off as a burrito. 

My second visit I had learned my lesson and stayed away from the food. My friend, not heeding my words, decided to order some tacos. And of course the end result was...... bland tacos. The tacos at Del Taco are more flavorful.

Not all is bad at Agave though. Good atmosphere, friendly staff, and good drinks. They also have the largest selection of tequila I've seen and surprisingly good chips and salsa. At least they got something right. All this doesn't make the food taste better though so I can only recommend this as a place to get some drinks and eat some chips for the tequila enthusiast.Bad experience tonight for dinner. We ate there tonight and had bad service, salads and soups came out with main meals after a half hour wait for them. Looked as if some dishes were sitting in the heat lamp for awhile.  This is dinner time. Had to find a manager let alone the server never checked back to see how we were, but after the fact... then she said sorry.  The again is it service or is it Management and Kitchen issues. 
About 2 months ago we went to the one at Town Square just to have a salad and apps at the bar seating booths. Good service but it was funny, when the other person I was with presented a Landry's Manager card they were running everywhere and then the visits came. We never said nothing but of course he was embarrassed.
Here's the facts, it seems as though when these restaurants were once owned independently they had the best going on.  Great structure.  When Landry's takes over places, it is not the worst but it seems to go downhill in quality.  
After I told my friend about this he said his company cant retain managers and they treat everyone poorly.  Is that why some have closed as well?
People, do not waste your time or money at these places...move on!This show was entertaining, but maybe I was missing out because I'm not a big fan of the show.  I did learn later about some of the actors being out sick, so that could have contributed to it, but in general I think maybe this type of show just isn't my sort of thing.  I did get up and dance once, but wasn't really excited about doing it over and over again.  The story was kind of "eh" though some of the performers have terrific singing voices.

As a side note, the venue was kind of hard to find, and in fact two different groups of people within my party got the same bad directions from different Riviera employees!  They all sent us to the box office, where someone was stationed telling people that they were in the wrong place, and how to get to the show.  It wasn't a huge problem, just a little annoying.Great place if you're single and want to meet an unhappy housewife, or Kim Kardashian wantabee, in the bar. But, pick a different place for dinner.

I've actually been going there 10 years, and seen the place steadily decline. 

It's become a lot more of a corporate run, and the quality of the food reflects it. 

Skip the Sushi Bar, there are so many other better places in town for Sushi.

Their lunch menu for Hamburgers and Sandwiches are good. 

Salads are okay, if you don't mind bagged lettuce. Don't ask them to make anything special or different. Corporate doesn't allow that. 

Also, they do serve bread, only upon request, but the quality of the bread is such that you will want to take the loaf home, and use it for football practice.

If you have a favorite server here, don't get too attached. They have a very high turnover. Hostesses are snotty, because all the middle aged married men and all the single guys, who are desparate, hit on them, and give them "swollen egos".

Also, you will get exercise going there. Parking is always tough, and the front is reserved for "leased" exotic cars that belong to guys that are one paycheck away from bankrupcy, and need the cars to impress the Kardashian wantabees.Whyyyy.

Come on MGM. I know Excalibur is the cheapest hotel of your properties, but this is kind of embarrassing. When nearly all your food is tough and inedible, it's time to step it up. You know something's off when your staff (who are really nice +1 star) starts apologizing before you even say anything. I mean, I get that you're not aiming for Aria status, but when you're a Hometown Buffet at a Vegas price...

Sigh. I love Excalibur, but I do not love your buffet.Small lounge on the way tothe pool at the MGM Grand.
There is nothing grand about this place ......

The Pina Colada ..... exactly like a snow cone ! ! !
What a surprise.
Drinks have no flavor .... they are like shaved ice........
Drinks have a faint taste of pineapple and coconut.
Devoid of alcohol
32  hints that the drinks contain spirits.
Do they really ???

Kids coming back from the pool could drink here ........
there is no need to be 21 to get served ....... 
there is no alcohol ! ! !

People coming from the pool in need of that cool drink are happy to stop here on a 103 degree afternoon. 
They are already tanked from the pool and think this place is great.
Drinks at the pool are supurb .....
so you expect them to be good here as well .......   no they are not !

So try 32 again when you are sober ..... and see what you think ......
Buyer beware.
$ 9.00, $11.00 or even the bargain size at $12.00
For "shaved ice" ??????

Good service - hence two stars.

Come on MGM - you can do better than this ........
ripping off pool customers ............... man-o- man !!2.5...

Had the pork sandwich and chips and a beer and my friend had the caesar salad.

Food alone may have been 4 stars, but the service and the price brings the grade way down.  The chips with the sandwich are really bland, I left most of them.  Kind of disappointing when you're paying $15 for a sandwich lol.

Pork Sandwich - 5
Salad - 4
chips (with sandwich) - 1
Service - 2
Price - 1

The prices at MGM's restaurants seem out of control, even for the strip.  I live at an MGM property and i'd like to go more given that it's close, but even given that I can afford it I feel ripped off to a certain extent after every meal :(

If you want a good sandwich head to Earl Sandwich at Planet Hollywood and pay 1/3 the cost.I used to come here all the time when I was younger with my family.... The other Restaurant we first were going to go didn't open for another 30 mins so we decided to come here, This time only with my mom, boyfriend and son. Over the years the food went down hill. The best thing about our meal was the chips and beans and also the cheese crisp. But the meal portion not pleasing for ALL of us.... I ordered the season ground beef taco, and shredded beef tamale with rice and beans. Taco was dripping with a pool of grease got half way and couldn't finish, the tamale red sauce had an off taste. Rice and beans were okay.... But with the main course off setting,  I just didn't want to finish my meal. My boyfriend didn't even finish his meal either because the ground beef enchiladas was over seasoned and just way to salty. My mom was off and on with the food... But later she told me it made her sick and kept throwing up.... All in all, I/WE will never come back to THIS location.I tried this place yesterday since i was in the area and in the mood for Chinese. The girl behind the counter was very nice.. The Kung Pao chicken looked good but it was just meh when I tasted it, The hot and sour soup was ok but nothing special. This place is not bad but I doubt I will go here again and would not recommend it, Like someone else said i should have checked Yelp first before following impulse to try something new,I've tried to like this place, but just haven't really ever had a good meal here.

It's a bit grungy every time I go in, and the burritos are usually dry and flavorless.

It wasn't even good after 14 beers.So friends came in and stayed at the Monte Carlo, so the night they came in we thought we would keep it mellow and do something at the Monte Carlo. We ended up at the Pub....if you are looking for a large beer selection this is the place, but that's the only attraction I can see to the pub. When we arrived at the pub we gave the hostess our name and she said it would be five minutes. We sat down at the bar, maybe 10 feet from the hostess station. I watched 6 different sets of people come up to the hostess station and get seated before us. I then walked over one of the hostess (Angie) and she said " I know I Know but I can't do anything, she is in charge and pointed to ilma. ilma then tried to tell me that all 7 parties she sat after we arrived had reservations.  Then she tried to tell me that they needed to clean a table. FINALLY we were seated, I don't understand that they had to clean a table when we walked into the bar / restaurant is was only half full. I asked 3 of the parties who arrived after us but were seated before us if they had reservations....guess what? They did not.  Food was okay for the Strip, our waiter was pleasant. We happen to be ther for the duling pianos karaoke, if you think that sounds fun (could be) DON'T waste your time.  Talked my friend into doing a duet Karaoke so I went up with the request ($10.00 in had because they said that they were playing the songs in the order of who TIPPED them the most at the time. Yeah you read that right. So when I walk up to request the song, weird coincidence, they started playing that song. I told there Karaoke guy your not going to believe this, but this is what I was requesting and handed him the paper request. He said owe it's $20.00 if you want to sing Karaoke (no wonder only 3 people did Karaoke in the 2 hours we were there.), but he couldn't stop the song .....no one but the dueling pianos were playing, and that I would have to pick another song to sing. Who ever heard of charging for Karaoke (Unless it was a competition with an entrance fee). Then to top it off if I REALLY wanted to be entertained by talent music and vocals then THIS is NOT the place to be. There are way TOO many places in a service orientated industry in Las Vegas for me to ever enter this establishment again.The following pretty much sums up my experience at Zoe's:

Me: "Hi, I'd like the turkey pita please"

Zoe(or sum other dumb bitch): "So you'd like the feta with feta?, would you like something to drink, or maybe a side of feta?"

One word..... Sick! (and I actually like feta... well, used to)
I will not be back.

Oh, and some extremely old dood hit on me while I was waiting for my lunch. Now, while I don't exactly blame that on Miss Zoe, I am convinced that he wouldn't have been there if it weren't for all that feta.

How is there more than one of these shitholes in the valley?? Someone please explain. blech!
2 stars because my Sun Chips hadn't been tampered with... at least to my knowledge.My Greek salad was fine but nondescript.  I was especially disappointed in the children's menu.  Pb & j on white bread...really?  we feed our dogs better.  I was hoping for some more nutritious options.Incompetent service, insufficient seating for the volume of customers, and none of their soups are vegetarian.  They've even found a way to make tomato soup with chicken inside.  This place is several notches down from the quality and menu at Wildflower Bread Co.

Ordered a birthday cookie and they misspelled the words 'birthday' and '60th'.  Unbelievable!All the sensuality of a stop-motion Barbie doll parade done by 14 year olds whilst drinking mom's sherry in the basement....but should I tell you what I really think?
The dancers are incredibly fit and most are classically trained dancers. But the Za Za Zu is missing....with one exception. There is a number performed by a dancer writhing all over a red lip couch that is sexy, and kittenish at the same time....
The lip-synch is unneccessary...we all know they are not really singing so why pretend the canned music is anything but....
The male dance team was entertaining.
Then there is the customer service. 
We purchased 6 tickets through our hotel concierge and wanted the very best of seats. We were prepared to go another time and/or pay the top price for those seats. Our concierge was offered "VIP seating" which we took....it was then revealed that we could get a discount by going through her. What a bonus! We were offered both price categories but still chose the most expensive of the two. We were given a voucher that clearly stated "VIP seating". When my husband went to the box office to redeem and pay for the tickets, he asked where they were on a seating chart but the CSR got side tracked and got around to it.
We had dinner reservations so were planning on coming just before curtain with our group. So time was tight. But when shown to our table at the back and slightly to the side of centre, I was livid! I told the usher that this was not acceptable and was told to go to the box office, but the house lights were going down and the rest of the party just took their seats and didn't want to be disruptive to the rest of the audience. 
I figured I would go to the box office after and complain, but the box office was closed after the performance.
Now I am actively hunting down the box office management and hotel customer relations people to get an explanation.
My hotel concierge is unhappy with them and not inclined to do further recommendations for them. 
So, I perhaps would have been more receptive to the show, had my tickets been what I requested and the usher/house manager been less dismissive. I never make a scene, I never cause trouble, and I deal with things in private, in a respectful, restrained manner. I have been involved with theatre for over 30 years, and have never been so disappointed and discouraged.Good food, but not worth the price. Me and my husband paid $100 (tax and tip) for waffles, the duck omelet thing, and French toast. That's it! You're pretty much going to pay for the ambience, because the food was not up to par.I go to the gym for the cardio equipment. The belts on most of the treadmills are completely warped. I tried about 4 different treadmills today, and the warping was so bad on 3 of them I could feel the belt slipping as I walked. It feels strange, and is a possible safety issue as far as I am concerned. I haven't noticed anything else about the gym so far. It seems clean. Staff is friendly. It's just that I think they are doing a very poor job maintaining the equipment. Nearly every gym I've been to in Las Vegas has suffered through maintenance issues. I think this may be due to the recession and subsequent drop in membership. I'm at the point now where I'm just going to drop my membership and buy my own treadmill if this location doesn't get its act together.ugh...not very good.  had both breakfast and lunch on separate occasions.  sure the variety is OK and the selections unique (chocolate chip waffles!), but the quality seemed sad and lacking.  cost is SUPER CHEAP, so that is nice.  but unless I was staying here (which I was this time), I wouldn't make a special trip.  lines can be HUGE at times, which is yet another negative.  but if you like buffets, give this a go if you're in the area.  staff was excellent on both occasions, so that was nice.I haven't been to Gotham in a long time, and now I remember why. A lot of the reason is I just don't care much for the bagels. I prefer a chewy bagel, and every bagel I've ever had from Gotham is dry. I usually order a plain bagel, so maybe their other varieties fare better, but then again if your bagel dough / cooking method can't stand on its own it doesn't instill confidence that I'll enjoy the rest of the selection. I realize, though, that this is a matter of taste; the food has never been bad, but it's never wowed me either.

The immediate go-to argument is that I've never had a NY bagel, but I have. I lived out east for several years, and while I won't pretend to be a bagel expert I have had some darn good bagels. So again, it's fine - a lot of kids I know eat there weekly if not more often, so try it for yourself and see if it's your thing.

What drops the rating from three stars to two is the service. It's always painfully slow. It took somewhere between ten and fifteen minutes for me to get my untoasted bagel with cream cheese. The orders came out in the order they were placed, which is nicely democratic, I suppose, but while people's sandwiches etc were cooking in the back, why not quick slice my bagel and spread some cream cheese on it? It takes literally a minute, maybe two if you've got to grab a clean knife or something. I had the day off and thus the leisure of sitting around, but if I'd just stopped in to grab something quick (like, you know, an untoasted bagel with cream cheese) it'd have been really frustrating. On Farmer's Market Saturdays, I've waited nearly 45 minutes to get my food. 

Part of the wait could be remedied by hiring a couple more people to work the counter, or putting the people there to use. There were a couple guys back by the grill, one guy slicing & wrapping (and seeming like it was his first day on the job), and two people at the register. One was a friendly girl who just stood there, and the other was a somewhat salty, no-nonsense guy who is presumably the owner (I'm basing this on his chef's jacket). Maybe her actual job is to temper the owner's curt demeanor?

While the owner wasn't rude, exactly, he also seemed borderline annoyed that I was wasting his time by ordering food. Sorry for wanting to fork over my money to you, sir. Won't make that mistake again! One person pointed out that rudeness is what people might expect from a New York-themed place, but I've never once been treated that badly by anyone in New York. 

I will admit that sometimes his sass works in your favor - one of the people I was with wanted ice for the remainder of his coffee, and the seemingly-new guy grabbed a handful and was ready to toss it in when the owner stepped in and said, "What's going on here, what are you doing?" "He wanted ice for his coffee." "Throw that out. Use the scoop. Come on." Point: owner.

The last of my gripes comes with the price. $5 for a plain bagel, plain cream cheese, and medium coffee is kind of ridiculous, especially considering there are no special or expensive ingredients in my order and you get the coffee yourself. I guess I'll just sum things up with my overall feelings toward Gotham: meh.I can't speak for lunch or dinner, but I would not sugget you stop here for breakfast. I had the 5.99 steak and egg special. Th steak was two sliced stripes of steak, so you can hardly call it a steak. the potatoes were country potatoes and they were too hard. The best part of the meal were the eggs. The tables wasn't wipped down properly and my arm kept getting stuck on the sticky table.My boyfriend and I went to try this place after reading good reviews on Yelp...I was disappointed.  The oysters weren't very fresh, the waiter was stuffy, and my boyfriend's salmon and rice came in little itty portions served on an oversized plate. I also tried their "Sugar Daddy" cocktail and it tasted like Tylenol.  I don't dislike the place but I probably wouldn't go back.Scale of 1-10 (single visit):

I'll go back because it had a quirky-factor that I liked and b/c I need to try a burger to really gauge the food, but there were no drink specials (sorry, cheap "domestics" doesn't cut it) and my overpriced Frito Chili Pie wasn't good.  The chili was below average and it used shredded cheese.  Frito Chili Pies need nacho cheese.  That's Frito Chili Pie 101.  The service was also slow and uninformed, but she might have been new so maybe that'll come up too.  Luckily the deep fried, bacon wrapped hot dogs saved the Food score a bit.Well, now why is this large dog park just a large basin, surrounded by a fence - so when it rains, it turns into a lake?  How did that happen?  Just filling in the muddy holes isn't going to fix this or create a dog park the central city can be proud of

Let's look at the small dog park opposite it and notice that the land is sloped and as such, rainwater drains nicely and the park can be open the day after a rainstorm.

Not so, the larger dog park.  It will now be closed for weeks while we watch the "lakebed" dry up. Too bad this wasn't thought out more thoroughly by the planners.  There are so many other areas within Indian Steele Park that would have worked..

Happy to have a large dog park?  Yes, I am.   But it could have been planned more carefully.

Will it ever be fixed?

KonaCame here to kill some time one morning and made the mistake of ordering breakfast here.  $2 bloody marys...$3 mimosas...cheap breakfast specials.  It wasn't even worth the couple of bucks- the food was pretty cheap and tasteless and my bloody mary couldn't even pass for tomato juice.  

This place would be better for drinks and bar food but for games there is a $50 minimum.

The service was pretty good however but again...food not really anything special nor is it even worth the cheapness.We came here for for a pool party on Vegas on the Rocks weekend.  It was crazy busy.  You could barely move.  $20 cover to get in. They tables were very expensive to rent and had a very large minimum purchase which I know is to be expected).  If you did not rent a table, there was no seating.  They did not allow any outside drinks--even closed bottled water--you were searched and they were taken.  

Pros:
Open bar (free) during certain hours
Limited menu offered
Dunk a ChipNDale
Free snacks (popcorn, snow cones)
Great DJ

Cons:
Too crowded
No where to sit
No open tables
Very expensive
Small pool
Very small spaceClean.
I love this chain for their $1 coupons and gas rewards. 
Staff is rude at this location. Every time I ask a question they just stare at me like a deer in headlights.
So if I'm only going in and out and not needing to ask anything this is my store of choice. 
Oh Yeah .. 
The cashier had a hickey on her neck for goodness sake!**I'm posting this again, because I guess I posted the first one to the wrong light rail?**

I have taken a ride on the light rail a few times now and I have some stories!! The first time I rode the light rail I took it from Mill Ave to Phoenix to see the D-Backs and Cubs play. My friends had caught a tram in Mesa so I sat there and watched a few trams come and go before I got onto the one with my friends on it. That was easy enough...there was enough room for me and the ride was smooth and fun (though I can't say it was relaxing)...Any ways. After the game was quite an experience! The tram ride home was a little more crowed now that the game had let out. There were two die hard fans in our car from the two teams who started talking trash to each other...well one of them had a little too much to drink and one thing lead to another and they were soon yelling threats at each other. Right before the drunker one took a swing (in a very crowded car) an older man stood up and shut them both up before someone got hurt...the tension in the air was thick the whole way back to Tempe where the Cub fan got off and punched the window. The friends of the other guy had to hold him back...I mean come on!! 

Okay, then I had the pleasure of using the light rail to go to the Circus. Again I was headed to Phoenix but this time I got on at the Washington stop. It was again a fun ride, but I couldn't say that it was a relaxing ride...there was this bum who was asking people for money and I think it would be better with some music playing in the background...any ways the ride home wasn't as eventful as the baseball game crowd, but again, there was another bum asking for money...can people just ride in peace?

I like the light rail - I really do...it's always an interesting experience, but I just don't feel safe on it. I used to take the metro bus from Gilbert to Mesa every day for a while and I felt safer on that then I do on the light rail and the bums who ride the bus don't ask me for money either.Being that I was on a Light Rail pub crawl, I had to take advantage of the light rail...I walked down from Mill Avenue to the Light Rail and boarded the train to Priest & Washington. My friend has written about odd folks on the light rail, and this was no exception. On the way back from the bar I sat too far from where the train would stop. After it finally stopped, I began walking toward it and realizing it was further away than I expected, I started jogging (and drunk jogging is not impressive). Still, as I drew closer the chimes sounded and the door started to close before I made it - then an arm came through stopping the door and I was able to board. It was an older guy who appeared to be in the same condition I was in - or worse. A few young college students were behind me and starring at him in amazement as he started talking to me. He asked me if I was from here. Queen Creek I said. Oh, you are from here? Well, really from Ohio. He said but from Earth? He told me that he mostly recently came from Albuquerque and he was trying to get back on this train. He talked to me about time travel and how his relatives came from St. Louis on a wagon and it took 6 months. Isn't an airplane a form of time travel? You can make the same journey in 3 hours. How is that possible? I did keep up the conversation with him because he really into his tale and would agree to any BS I threw out there. I said telephones might be the next time travel machine and this light rail was a form of time travel also. He talked about Einstein and Relativity... As we reached the Mill exit he said he was trying to ride the train back to Albuquerque and maybe if he stayed on it he would find his way back....good luck with that - but thanks for holding the door for me!dinner is ususally good but last week my wife had a hair on the lemon garnish and the waiter just picked it off with his hands...gross.  WE insisted on another entree.  Nothing was credited or offered.I was just there this morning.  And again about two weeks ago.  I think the food is still pretty good and they changed their stupid pricing policy about not being able to buy BBQ at the deli and then sitting down and ordering some other dishes and eating some BBQ that we just bought.  But my gripe this morning is the crappy customer service.  I hate to generalize, but many Chinese restaurants have crappy attitudes about customers and feel that they are doing the customers a favor by taking our money and patronage.  I was there at 10 am the opening time to buy some BBQ.  I waited until 10:10 before they opened the doors, although the people saw me standing there.  And when I walked in, it took them another five minutes to grumpily ask me what I wanted.  Again, hate to generalize by many Chinese and Korean restaurants are like this.  Why is that?  Must be the heritage or something.The food is great but but not worth the incredibly slow service. The drive they takes forever.Why is it so hard to deep fry your frozen rolled tacos to a crispy finish so I can enjoy a crunchy experience the whole way through? Only the ends seem to ever be crispy at any Valley taco shop. The middle remains a soft mushy mess of frustration time and time again. After I eat your lousy rolled tacos, I can never go back because if you can't accomplish that feat, then the rest of your food will likely fall in line. The six rolled taco combo was also kinda cheap-ass. They only put guac on the things, no sour cream, lettuce or anything. Let's also throw in the fact that you must pay for the hot carrots and your lack of a salsa bar is ignorant in 2013. Oh, yeah, the cheese quesadilla was the only redeeming item I purchased. After four green beers, usually most Mexican food tastes good, but this meal was a glaring exception.Crescent moon is far, far below the usual standards of a Four Seasons hotel, and the expectations that anyone should have of dining at a Four Seasons resort, even at casual venue.

The food was on the same level as I would expect from any local Tex-Mex cafe, but at twice the price.   What a let down.I went there to watch a couple of bowl games.  Two big screen TV's long with a host of other TV's.  Problem was, the Big Screens are so old and so dark its like watching TV through a dirty screen.

Asked the bartender about switching one TV to another game that was on, and no one was watching the game that was on, and i got a dissertation on why She could not do that.  The place has a lot of potential, but the staff seemed very very unhappy, the waitresses looked like they had all just gotten out of bed and threw on clothes cause they had to go to work, no thought process at all.  

Food is ok, but pricey for what you get and where your are.  Really nothing special about this place, and the TV situation makes it a not go to ever again to watch a sporting event.I guess my pizza was better than Domino's or Pizza Hut, but I wouldn't likely eat here again, which is unfortunate because it's so close to my office.

My pizza was made with cheap ingredients and tasted like it. The breading wasn't anything to write home about either.

Not sure where all the 4- and 5-star reviews are coming from... Clearly they're either faked, customers don't know the difference between crap pizza and quality pizza, or they've downgraded their ingredients since then (2 weeks ago in reference to Joey B's 5-star review!). Poor Joey wouldn't know good pizza if it gave him a reach around!

If you want amazing New York-style pizza in Mesa, go to Venezia's (venezias.com) and if you want the best New York-style pizza in Arizona, go to Joe's (eatatjoesny.com) in Scottsdale.I've really tried to like the Gilbert House. Been there several times; unfortunately, I've always left underwhelmed. The coffee isn't very good. The dishes are unique, but lack taste. I ordered a spinach and goat cheese quiche last Sunday. The quiche was cool (expected it to be a bit warmer) and only had a hint of spinach. Not what I expected.  Prices are ok, but there are so many good independent restaurants in the area, that there is just no good excuse for bad foodFirst, I'll start by saying that Home Depot is one of my favorite stores of all time.  I can spend HOURS in one without even realizing it.  I've been to many and have loved them all - everyone is so friendly and helpful.  And I am a sucker for great customer service - especially when you're spending lots of money.  

That being said, I was not impressed here.  My visit happened early Tuesday morning and the store was not very crowded.  The first employee I ran into was VERY helpful. And that's where the customer service ended.  I hunted around for someone to help me with my flooring questions.  I knew exactly what I needed and just had a couple of questions on measurement calculations. The person who was supposed to be the "expert" in that department had absolutely no idea how to answer any of my questions and had to finally call someone on the phone to answer - a "pro", he was called.  I asked if the "pro" could be the one to help me instead as my special order was going to cost over $300.  I was denied the "pro's" assistance.  All my questions were answered with "probably" and "I think".  The most definite answer I could get was "I'm pretty sure".  The store rep finally placed the order for a piece of flooring that was too big for what I needed, which would of made my floor boards completely uneven.  Yikes!  I ended up cancelling the order and going to Floor & Decor instead.  

I'll be back to Home Depot for other things.  Just not that one.

The store was not crowded and there were no wait times at the registers, most likely because this location is so far southeast.  If you know exactly what you are looking for, do not need ANY assistance and are in a hurry, this would probably be a great location for you.The food is Burger King food. I don't have high expectations regarding quality. I do however expect that customer service will be at least up to par with other fat food joints. 

This morning, i pulled in to grab a quick sandwich before a long day of meetings. After the car in front of me got done ordering, i pulled up to the menu, and was greeted in the normal fashion. Provided my order and got a "thank you". No total. No instructions to pull forward. So I pulled forward. Then the wait started....3 minutes......5 minutes....*shuts off engine*.....7 minutes before the person in front of me was presented with their order.....then more waiting, as the car and the girl in the window carry on a conversation lasting approximately 2 minutes.

When I finally got to the window. The employee asks "What did you want on that again?". I was a little taken back and said "So, my order has not been put in yet?". She snapped at me in a very matter-of-fact tone "NO".  Had she seemed even remotely understanding i would have just placed my order at the window. Instead I placed my money back into my pocket and began to pull away. At which point I received a very sarcastic "Byeeeeee".

For the Owners/Manager/Operators: There is very little that distinguishes your food from the other fast-food joints. I don't go because it's better. I go because it's convenient to where I am at any given time. I will, however, give my business to locations that provide stellar customer service. If you aren't communicating the need for customer service to your employees, you are failing. If your employees are not providing at LEAST a minimum of proper customer service, then they are failing you, and your bottom line. 

I won't be going back to this location any longer for food, drinks, or the occasional shake anymore.I was actually disappointed in my recent experience at Barnes & Noble.  I recently went into this particular store in search of a certain book trilogy that has been hyped up in the media. Anyhow, I entered here and was not greeted as I am use to back in Iowa. I roamed around looking for what I was after for a bit of time, as the associate at the service counter appeared busy on the phone. Was it a business call or personal?!?  The associates I encountered seemed as if they were annoyed and didn't care for their jobs. The young man at the register also left a lot to be desired. It were as if he were a robot. 

I'll give the place another chance in the future, due to the proximity to home. However, I won't expect good customer service. A firm two stars simply because of location.I have stayed here many times and its always been very nice. The grounds and course are beautiful, the restaurant is marginal and pricey. I would recommend going elsewhere. 
I checked in on a Tuesday and staying until Saturday. I was told they make the room every 4 days and mine would not be made up during my stay. If I needed anything please call. This is ridiculous and the trash has built up, the bed needs changing, a burner on the stove doesn't work. With the cost to stay here you would think they would at least come in and tidy up maybe empty the trash. Other hotels for less money do it daily. I have noticed they must of let go a  lot of the maids, very few around anymore. Since this place was purchased by another company, I guess they think the guest are not of value anymore and they can treat us badly.
Their attitude is "here's your room, you tend to it, we'll clean it after you leave"
I hate it when new owners ruin a good thing!!!  
Hot tip of the day: Go somewhere else!Went there this past Wed. to meet my gal for lunch. She ordered the garlic shrimp which was undercooked and I ordered the Lamb souvlaki which gets smaller and smaller with every visit. No more tsatsiki sauce included either. Once our waiter dropped off the meals, he disappeared, no"how is your meal?" No"can I get you a refill?" Finally ask us when he dropped off the Bill. This ain't brain surgery folks.(owners)
Good service, good food, good value, and CONSISTENCY. Chain restaurants might not be your thing, but at least they are CONSISTENT,across the country. I blame the owners and managers, train your staff correctly. Maybe watching an episode of "Restaurant Impossible" would help out.OK, this place deserved 2.5 stars.

Sushi quality was very good:  4-5 stars.  Prices were obscene, though, even with that quality of fish.  Minus 1 star for that.

Service was lacking.  The place was nearly empty yet I had to wait a long time for everything.  Don't feed me piecemeal when there is NO ONE at the restaurant.  I sat at the sushi bar and had to wait for every pair of sushi to be served to me.  I'd like to pick what order I eat my fish.

Please know what fish you do have and don't have.  This is a sushi restaurant.  It's like a bell captain who has to stop and ask the blackjack dealer where the elevators are (...which happened at the Venetian, btw.  But I digress.)  Minus 2 stars. 

Yeah, overall, the experience was lacking.  Aka... sucked.How things have changed...

I can remember eating at Ricardo's back in the 80's & 90's, when the inside felt as authentic as the mariachi singers sounded; now, it's reverted somewhere between a Denny's and Chucky Cheeze.    

-No mariachi singers and the place doesn't even remotely feel authentically Mexican; it was almost like we stepped into a restaurant at a theme park...you know; those cheaply themed places where the quality of the food is determined by how loud the screaming child is next to you. 

Price:  I would never pay this much for crap American-Mexican food!

Overall Experience:  Yuck...
 
Conclusion:  Another original and locally established restaurant gone to crap over time.  A victim of poor planning and lack of investment.  You would think that a place like this should only be getting better with time, instead they've stripped it of it's authenticity.Uh, as I have over 400 check-ins, I guess I should review this place.

I USED to like the District.  However, because people in Las Vegas are unreasonably lazy, they are now putting a road through the center.  Because, you know, people cannot be bothered to walk more than 10 feet to get their Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.  

And, due to the new road, the 10-year-old trees had to meet an early death via chainsaw.  Thanks, you lazy a&*holes!  Now, in their place are palm trees.  How creative!

I hate everyone. Bleck.I visited the Canyon Ranch Spa for a Mixology Massage last weekend in Vegas.  I am an avid massage lover, and I usually go to the Four Seasons in Los Colinas and when in NY, the Mandarin Oriental.  The Four Seasons and Canyon Ranch have similar price points, so I expected similar quality.  It was not.  I was told to arrive 45 minutes prior to my appointment time as I was to custom mix my own body oil to be used during the massage (which sounded WAYYYY more fun then it actually was!!!)  I did arrive early, but by the time I got lost due to confusing directions from an unenthused locker attendant, waiting on my appointment attendant to finish her soda and magazine before shouting my name along with 4 other women as if we were lining up for polio shots, waiting for a sales person to finish selling Clarisonics and add ons before rushing through my and 2 other people's mixology ordeal (again NOT FUN AT ALL and the girl didn't even explain ANYTHING), then waiting in the conservatory for my massage therapist who the shopgirl had laughed "was probably looking for you for the last 10 minutes".  I felt rushed, stressed out, and I was late getting started for my massage.  Now, the massage itself was pretty good, but you know your massage wasn't great when the moment your therapist walks out of the room, you start to rub your own back on the parts he missed....

And even though we got started late due to no fault of mine, my massage ended very abruptly and promptly when it would have ended if I were actually getting started on time.  You would think the shop attendant or appointment attendant would have advised the therapist that there had been some mishaps and to make sure I get my full amount of time.  Don't make me be the fussy b*tch that says it.  Also, all these "attendants" accounted for nothing.  They all had lackluster personalities, no smile or warmth at all, and all these helpers and I still had no clue where to go or sit or wait.  At the Four Seasons, someone WALKS YOU FROM SPOT TO SPOT.  And that place isn't even that big!  Even though I am a regular, even if I am only getting an eyebrow wax...someone walks me from the reception desk to the eyebrow wax lady (hi Melissa! You r tha BEST!) and everyone is always friendly and calming and knows exactly how to run the show.

Anywho, will never be back.  The End.We are here in Las Vegas at the Tahitti Village resort for 5 days and and without room service. It is the first resort I have ever stayed at that says because we are not here for a full week, we can not get anyone to make our bed or bring clean towels daily. We love the resort but the lack of room service will keep me from coming back and I will be sure to tell friends to stay away. It's too bad because it's a nice place.They told me they would pick me up at 11:15am from the Wynn. I was outside since 11am. No car at 11:30. I called twice and they said allow 15-20 min for traffic. Now it's 11:45 and still no car. Terrible, don't useI've used Desert Cab a few times with mixed results. The general wait time is 20-25 minutes for a cab, but if you're lucky, a cab will come within 10 minutes.

One time I called for a cab around 2PM. Was told the standard wait time. 2:30 rolls around and I call DC. The dispatcher said there was situation in Summerlin and told me to wait 30 minutes. Okay.... I was on the east side of town - were ALL of their cabs over there in Summerlin?? I cancelled the cab and called another company.

Another time I called for a ride, the cabbie didn't know the directions and asked me to navigate. They don't have GPS? Maybe a lot of their cabbies are all just used to taking tourists to the Strip and the Airport, but not other places in town.Easy to miss from the street. Cannot enter if west bound on Charleston. Not enough parking and small spaces. When it was my turn in line the cashier took order from people behind me. The guy and his pregnant wife ordered ignoring that I was in line ahead of them.  Perhaps I should have made a scene, instead I went back to the end of the line. I waited while five other people who were behind me ordered before me.  I ordered Gyros plate to go. Was $10.15 (included tax). Soda was $2! Are you kidding me? Hello, you are not on the strip. Food was mediocre. Nowhere near as good as Shish Kabob Cafe. I realize one is Greek and other is Armenian, but items on menu are similar. For dine in, Yassou serves food on disposable plates. Cheesy. I would describe as overpriced fast food.  I was not impressed and will probably not go back.Hit and miss. Have been here many times and have had some good nights and some bad ones. Food is good, albeit greasy, and decent beer menu. Won't change the tvs from nba so if you prefer anything else, go down the road.With reviews like this I was expecting to never want to leave this place.  We went for breakfast and I won't go making this a destination for early morning fare ever again.  I'm not docking stars for limited B, just reviewing based on what we ate which was BREAKFAST BEYOND BLAND.

Decor is delightful and they do have outdoor strip seating, but you're better off sticking to the liquid and saving up for a buffet.  

Ham/egg/cheese on ciabatta was $13  
Irish breakfast (size and quality of Dennys) will run you $16I love this place because we come here every time we're in Vegas. We have so many good memories here and the entertainment is fantastic. The Irish dancing is so cool and the music is a lot of fun! 
BUT if you're hungry, this place is eh. We've had the irish soda bread, some sandwiches, the baked brie, irish nachos, and the pot pie... the pork chops (if they're still available) were great and memorable. Drinks are consistently good and of course the decor and ambiance is fun and lively. This is a must see for tourists coming to New York, New York.Not so very good, and definitely not better than any big chain fast food. The fries had no flavor, O rings were strangely sweet (cornmealy?), burger was just "meh". Won't go back unless I need some frozen slushy high fructose.Service at this location has been sub par every time I've been. I've also been a few times when their hours say they should be open only to find they've closed early. In short, food is good; service, not so much.Searching for a 'healthy' option for lunch led me to KK. Picked up a large Greek salad ($4.99) and an order of chicken boti ($7.99). 

Wait, before I chat about the food, let's discuss the place...it's pretty narsty. Seriously, there are wilting posters of gyros on the wall. Poster of gyros? Excellent. Gross poster from 1970? Not something you want to find in a food establishment. When looking around (it took 15 min to make the boti) you can see the place is really long and the kitchen is large for what they put out. I think it's time for a remodel peeps. It should also be noted that the guy at the counter was messing around with his foot and the bottom of his sock (yep, he was in socks n sandals) before taking my order. I couldn't bear watching to see if he was handling my food, so I sat in the corner. Ignorance is bliss, no? 

So I got my order and went home. The boti ended up consisting of 5 pieces of super awesome chicken and a truck load of rice. Damn that was good chicken! Tender, spicy, yum! But 5 pieces stinks for $8. It was like eating a rice salad with kabob on top. Lame. The large Greek was decent in size for the price, but the dressing lacked any sort of flavor. Kinda reminded me of Italian house dressing (gasp!). 

This all being said, I'll be back. Def for a gyro and yes, maybe even for 5 delish pieces of chicken over a rice salad. Hold the sock grime. Actually, put it on the side.Hmm well I really like Pho and was excited to have a place on strip. However broth was good and the topping are good to a standard Pho restaurant. However Pho needs to be hot! and this was just very warm. The service was as bad as it gets. The workers talking among themselves loudly, slow service! No drink refills! I had to chase down a person to get a check. I might only come back just for emergency strip Pho. But thats it. This place is ran like a dirty dive and it shows. Pretty sad this place is on the strip. Treasure Island!! This place could be great if you look at the people working there more closely.Booked two rooms and requested that they be adjoining rooms due to having a child and wanting that child to be next door.  Not a tough request, or so I thought, but upon arrival at 4pm, 1 room was ready, the other wasn't and was told to check back in an hour.  Weird we thought since check-in was at 3pm, but not a big deal because we had to get dinner anyways.  Got dinner and an hour later checked back in and surprise!  room was still not ready...so we went up to the room that was ready and waited a half hour and when we still didn't hear anyone working on the room next to us, we decided to then complain.  By then it was nearly 5 hours past check-in and we were furious.  Asked to speak with a supervisor and was told that it was our fault..yes..OUR FAULT for asking for adjoining rooms.  There are hundreds of adjoining rooms in the hotel and yet they saw it as a special request?  On top of that they made it seem like our fault?  This is Vegas people..where there are more outrageous requests than anyone can believe and they can't handle a simple request like that?!  Overall, if this hadn't happened, I would've probably given them 3 stars, because the casino was in good shape, the rooms were alright, bathroom was dated and felt a little grimy, but for $40/night, who can complain?  I would say that if you're looking for a more full Vegas experience, PH is not where you want to stay.  But if you're on a budget but want a great location off the strip, you could try this place..just don't ask for extra soap or anything out of the ordinary because they probably will "F" it up!Had to dock 3 stars for the following reasons:
---Took at least 1/2 hour for our order to be ready when we were told that this would be only 15 mins. max.  We did not order a lot, nor anything extravagant.
---The entree they were correcting (which they said was the reason why it took so long) was the wrong entree.  Couldn't take it back as it was a "to-go" order, so by the time we got the whole order home, it's a done deal.
---The noodles on the pad thai tasted old.
---They forgot the ice coffee I ordered, which was only included after I reminded them.

Reasons for the 2 stars:
--Staff was friendly.
--Pineapple fried rice was good and tasty.

I would probably try another Thai place before going back to this one.I'm a fan of Krispy Kreme and its sweet glazed goodness.  BUT I had to deduct stars because they gave me an incomplete order.  

My mom went in the other day ordering  a dozen varied donuts, but asked for the dozen to be split into two boxes (with six donuts each).  One box was for us, and the other was for a friend.  We ate one on the way because we couldn't resist the temptation.  When we got to our friend's house with the other untouched box, there were two donuts missing!  We couldn't even go and grab our box to switch it because we had already eaten one.  It was so embarrassing to bring a spacious box with four donuts (that should have been six!) to their house as a treat.  It made my mom and I look like we had eaten the two, and just gave them the rest.

Not cool, Krispy Kreme.  Maybe it was our fault for not double checking before we left, but we trusted them to place the 12 donuts we paid for into the boxes. :(I really was expecting a good dining experience after reading the Zagat review.  The decor and service were great.  Unfortunately the food was very mediocre.  The spare ribs tasted like they were heated up from the day before.  The duck salad was mostly lettuce with a few tiny bits of duck for 18.00. The prawns were tasteless and obviously frozen.  A side dish we ordered was disgusting and none could eat it.  The thing i can't understand was the concierge at the Wynn Tower Suites had recommended this restaurant.  I would never even consider going back.This is a fantastic pool for the kiddos...however not so much for the adults who have to play Where's Waldo with their offspring because its so dang crowded. The lifeguards are good but they border being the swim gestapo (you have to be within arms distance of your kid under 8 at all times...gimme a break) and they are always excited to use their whistle. You can't use your own individual floaties...you must use connected ones or another Coast Guard approved life jacket.

Overall it was a fun day....cheap to get in ($3 for adults, $2 for 3-17 year olds and 2 and under free) and you can bring your own lunch. However get there at 11am on the dot (maybe earlier) or you won't get a good spot to lounge and be prepared to wade in a warm, salt water pool keeping your kids unreasonably close to you. Unfortunately for me the monkeys had a blast so we will be back.I took my husband here for the first time today and WOW. The cupcakes are grossly sweet. I can see why the kids love them so much. As for calling them gorment NO WAY! and way over priced on everything they offer. 

However we did like their Red Velvet cup cake, with that said it comes with cream cheese icing and not the overly sweet buttercream icing.Buffalo burger was really dry. Beer was good & they accommodate a group of 8 but it was so boring. I didn't enjoy a dry $12 burger but Frank, our waiter, was nice. Also cheese is an extra dollar, so is peppers, etc...  Took forever to get the bill.We came here on Halloween, first time and due to seeing all of the TV's everywhere we really wanted to watch a football game. The hostess was kind enough, none of them are like super friendly or anything, but she did her job. The waitress on the other hand, cute outfit and all, was kind of out of it. She talked us into getting the bucket of beers, I thought the 2-4-1 deal was better, but too late.....Anyways, we ordered wings, hubby and I split a cobb salad and got the fries. Food was meh...The wings, while nice and meaty, HAD NO SAUCE.....We communicated this to our waitress, and instead of investigating this, she basically refused to do anything at all and told us, "just put tobasco, our sauce is basically ketchup anyways." So helpful, NO! We communicated our disappointment with a mediocre tip. Overall, we will go anywhere else but here next time we are hungry and wanting to watch a game.This place is pretty much an abortion. I've been here twice now, once for a quick coffee stop (mediocre coffee), once for lunch today. What's up with them basically whispering your name when your order is ready?

The highlight of my meal (which was actually made correctly, but I had to confirm that my order had chips...they were about to let me pay almost $9 for a veggie sandwich and not take a side) was watching a guy stroke out on a manger after basically everything in his order was wrong.

Word to the wise, you have to know the menu and pricing system better than the staff here.Let the record show that I would never, EVER elect to eat here, but I was staying in the Flamingo for work and Hamada doesn't serve breakfast. 

Weird jiggly oatmeal, and sliced bananas cost a whopping extra $2.  Gaggles of enormous people in shorts and fannypacks and crew cuts (men and women), all yelling at each other from across the way.  I struggled to find a reason to spare this population from quick and searing death had I been granted merciless deity privileges for the day. 

That was not whip cream atop my chocolate malt.  That was pale slime.Oh Vegas, why with so many restaurants, in a city that runs all night, do your late night options always disappoint me?  Why?

Even with a full menu, there's not much here I wanted to eat.  My ham sandwich was decent, but that's about it.  The fries were too greasy, the burgers too dry, and the water barely refilled.  Just disappointing all around.

Seriously, the actual Planet Hollywood (up the strip, not in the PH hotel/casino, strangely) would have been better.  Hell, I'm pretty sure Denny's would have been better.  

The only reason you get two stars is because the place was indeed clean, and the insane amount of TV's distracted me from just how horrible everything else was.

You're fired.

~EEE~So, Deb's review: 
http://www.yelp.com/biz/executive-las-vegas-las-vegas#hrid:b11nnmpMhdk25XoWh3ssiA

Is almost exactly what happened to us. Head out about 12:30 for 1 p.m. pickup (3:35 p.m. flight). Hubby calls at 1:10, they say "15 minute window, call back", then calls at 1:30, to which they put him on hold to "find his reservation", another 10 minutes goes by they can't "find the driver" or " find his reservation". Finally gave up and flagged a taxi...which rarely is a bargain going back to the airport in this town.

Did I mention that on the way from the airport we got a sponsored Time Share presentation? We decided to go for the amusement value/discounted show, but yeah, just a heads up this company does those presentations on the bus.

These shuttles are fine for going TO the hotel but you end up hosed on the way back.Honestly, this mall is dead. I remember years ago as a little girl coming to this mall with my grandma and it was full of people and popular stores, and even not so many years ago when all the teenagers tried to pick whether they wanted to hang out here or Superstition...now I'm pretty sure almost nobody hangs out here. I only go here occasionally because it's right across the street and while it does have a few good stores (bath and body works, best buy, sears, the children's place, Spencer's etc.) most of the stores are just cheap no name clothing or random nick nacks. Also Macy's has closed and Dillard's is one floor now and pretty much an outlet store. I also can't remember of Forever 21 just recently closed or has been gone, never cared for it anyways. But American Eagle did just close also.
The food court is basic. Subway, orange Julius, Panda Express, and two or three other places I forgot the name of. Hotdog on a stick just recently closed and whatever used to be next to it and Cinnabon is long gone along with the bagel place that's been a random Mexican dessert/snack/I don't know what place for a long time now.
This mall is fine if you are looking for a specific store that they actually have or just want to get some exercise out of the heat but to come here and browse around for a variety of things might be a little difficult unless you enjoy Asian decor, stripper clothes, cheap plastic jewelry and bongs...
Point being, it's dead like the rest of the surrounding area.Our server couldn't properly take our orders. I ordered prime rib medium-rare with mashed potatoes and gravy. I received medium prime rib with mashed potatoes and no gravy on my mashed potatoes. My mom ordered her prime rib medium-rare but received well-done prime rib. My prime rib was dry, over cooked and not tender at all, very mediocre. The only plus is that the lady who served our beverages was very nice and more attentive than our server.So I know I really shouldn't expect much of a Thanksgiving dinner from a hotel cafe, so I really didn't order the turkey... but even for regular cafe food - I was sadly disappointed.  

Located in Ballys hotel, the Sidewalk Cafe has a wide variety of foods ranging from breakfast to sandwiches and burgers to pasta and steak.  We ventured to the cafe on Thanksgiving evening and were pleased that we weren't waiting in a 2 hour line.  Despite the short wait time, the service felt as though the place was jam packed.  Most of the menu ranges in the $10-$15 range.  I ordered the prime rib sandwich which is like a french dip.  I was very disappointed when I received my food and my french fries were no longer warm and my sandwich was too large to even put into my mouth! The meat was pretty dry and I was hoping that it would be okay since they provided me with aus jus sauce - I was wrong.  The sandwich also seemed to lack flavor. I added salt to my meat, but it didn't seem to help.  Also, I'm a huge ranch lover - and was VERY disappointed that the ranch dressing just tasted... off... I even stropped dipping my cold fries in the ranch because the taste was so... off.

All in all, the others in my party seemed to think that the food was "decent" but with so many places to eat in Vegas, I'm not too sure I'd go here again by choice.--expensive for business lunch
--servers very attentive, prompt
--lacks nth-degree detail of a Japanese chef running things; rolls and standards are safe, but needs a ...san to show them how it's done
--iced green tea is refreshing and plentiful. i had like 10 glasses.

sushi chef left my salmon skin pieces from the kitchen sitting on the pass for 10 minutes. server asked if she could bring me anything else and i had to point at the plate on the pass, now surely cold. it was.

spicy tuna mix was the standard gloop but at least did not have mayo.

tempura batter was gloopy not flaky and crispy like it should be.
veggie pieces for tempura were too big and had cool centers.
presentation lacked proper Japanese detail; straight from fryer to the plate, bits oil and all, carrot bits thrown at the plate.
sauce was too thick for tempura and no white radish to be seen anywhereA group of four of us went last night for the first time. I had purchased a Groupon, and was excited to check out a new winery. The service when we arrived was dismal. It took a tour leader from another group to flag someone's attention. We had reservations yet they acted surprised to see us. Given all this, if the wine had been great, we could have forgiven the service...it was not great. I don't expect the wine to be of Napa or Sonoma quality, but at least make up for it with your service.

Disappointing, and I'll stick to other local wine bars moving forward. I honestly can't believe this place has an average of 4 stars...The chicken was good and fresh off the frier. The workers were friendly but had to mention that our waitress needs a little "waitressing etiquette".  I asked her if the okra gumbo is spicy and she replied that she doesn't know 'cause she doesn't eat the stuff!Back to my Vegas trip...

We came here after walking around on the strip and aside from the place being super dark I was kind of excited to see what they had to offer.  First we must have came in the back way because I couldn't find the hostess or a server walking about.  Finally tracked one down and after some finagling we got seated upstairs.  The upstairs was nice but we didn't get a good seat to view the strip so we got tucked away in a corner which probably lead us to being ignored for a good 30 mins before we even got our drinks let alone placed our order.  I should have taken the cue to leave then.  We placed our orders and the waiter disappeared for another hour and finally brought back our food.  Seemed he was preoccupied with the lovely ladies in the other part of the restaurant.  I don't blame him, but at least check back once in a while.  We ate and left, the place was decorated well but the food was pretty mediocre.  Disappointing.Good sandwiches but but not great and I have to say the product is relatively small for the price.  Stay away from the salads though - they were not that good...like ordering fish at a steakhouse I suppose. . 

Not sure what all the rave reviews are about - seriously.Probably my least favorite of the Fox restaurants. It's good if you want a quick, cheap lunch. The past few times I've gone, it has seemed too much like a chain restaurant.

The food is rather heavy and rich. And if you're vegetarian and are planning on getting the macaroni and cheese, think again. It contains chicken broth. So you basically have three options left.

The bread is good though.So I had time one evening and I went "half-off show tickets" booth next to Bally's to see what I can get to kill some time, most of the shows were either very expensive or not on that night, so I decided to see X-Burlesque. I paid $41, I am glad I did not pay more because this shows barely worth's $41. I was recommended to take the discount ticket to box office one hour before the show to validate it, which I did. Then instead of waiting in line for an hour, I went to eat dinner. Came back 10 minutes before the show and I was the last guy in line, so I got the last seat. There were I think 10-12 girls dancing in small groups, while one group is dancing other group was getting ready. Yes, they get topless at every dance scene. Dances were okay, just okay, some girls had timing issues, could not keep of with the rest of the group, which shows that they do not practice enough. Lighting was designed so we do not see too much of girls, which is why they all looked to have spotless bodies. Although it was hard to see from all the way back. It was an okay show, worth the half-price I paid, will not repeat.I have not lived here, so I have to start with that, which I guess means this isn't the best review, but whatevs.

I went to check out the apartment because they were in my price range. The smallest 2-bedroom ("The Sanctuary") was actually not the greatest floor plan even though I was looking forward to its unique layout. The patio was small and the dining room was actually just big enough for a small table and 4 chairs, but the rooms were fairly big.

The lady showing us around was nice enough, but a little short at times. Everything was iffy until it came down to two things; I loved the French doors but as soon as I found a huge American cockroach I was pretty much out.

Also, the "Soleil" were above garages, had a much better layout, and had no evidence of roaches. It is possible those units have them, too, however not necessarily because they are in a separate building. Regardless, I didn't take my chance and I don't think you should either.Nice decor, so-so food.  Probably the most bland pho I've had in the Valley.  Nothing particularly negative about it - except of course bland pho is fairly negative.  The menu selection is also fairly limited compared to every other Vietnamese place I visit (Da Vang comes to mind, but who can compare with them?).  I'm going to go try a  few other selections and am keeping my fingers crossed they warrant an upgrade to 3 stars.  But can't do it based on the pho alone.Didn't know how to use the yelp coupon offer. Chips were old and cold. "A" team is not working tonight. Ill give it another try some other time.Wow this place was gross. For a healthy restaurant, I expected much more. Their salads seemed like they were from pre-made packs that you get from the grocery store or something. My friends and I came here for lunch intending on a healthy meal, but I was so grossed out by my food I literally only took 2 bites and threw it away. 

And I even got the Chinese Chicken Salad which is so basic and common! I should've taken a pic of it but I didn't. My friend got the veggie salad and WOW that looked so shriveled up and dead! It was so disgusting to look at. The veggies were all wilted.... 

The only good thing about this place is 1) you get $5 off your purchase of $25 if you check in on yelp...but honestly I would not even spend $20 here so idk if that deal is worth it...2) their slushy drinks are on point! So goood! But doesn't make up for the horrible tasting food.Wow. Gross. I love a place that makes great baked goods. I love a place that makes okay baked goods. I don't love Payard. 
I was in a desperate need of some pastries, baked goods and was hunting for macarons... enter Payard.
Right out of the gate I saw macarons and got excited. Then I found out that they're all pre-made, prepackaged and sold in packages of assorted flavors. How lame is that?! Super lame. Nibble nibble bleh. Not impressed. 
I decided to order their s'more crepe. What a let down. It's pretty hard to mess up a crepe. There was plenty of chocolate which was good as I love chocolate. There was next to no graham cracker on this crepe save for a few crumbs sprinkled sparingly on top of the whipped cream. The whipped cream is not home made and tastes funky. The marshmallow drizzly bits were tasty but definitely lacking. This was really a chocolate crepe that bumped into another crepe and had some of that other crepe's ingredients on it; like when you order French fries and your friend orders onion rings and you find that one onion ring hidden in your fries... except not awesome like that. The crepe itself was a bit chewy. Really... this was not an enjoyable breakfast at all. 
My vacation companion disliked their espresso to the point of not finishing it, throwing it out and offering to pay for both our coffees if I would go find a Starbucks. Starbucks coffee is better than Payard's coffee... seriously?!
The thing that is even crazier about this is I saw an "express" version of Payard elsewhere in the hotel/casino. Really?! Payard is already like a fast food version of a bakery. Next thing you're going to tell me they have McDonald's Express... oh, wait. I guess a shorter wait for bland food is a good thing though.
If you're not used to quality baked goods, crepes, macarons, etc then this is probably going to be an okay spot for your sweet tooth to get a fix but if you love quality and tasty treats you're better off passing on Payard. 
Not a fan.Whoaaaaa It's a bar in the middle of a casino....WOW...Ya. Wow....Uhm I can bring an ipod and be my own dj. Ya I can bring my collection of....Kelis, and Pet Shop Boys, Flock of Seagulls, and Yanni. Then I'd get all the girls. Because I can buy them all drinks in the middle of a casino, and jam to my dope sounds....in the middle of a casino.....and maybe get bottle service....in the middle of a casino....I can get game in the middle of a casino...
Ya actually it's nice. For being a bar in the middle of a casino. One of my friend's used to bartend there....and ya. It's ok - I guess I can stop there for a drink....and pay 12-14 dollars instead of putting a 20 in a slot machine and waiting for a cocktail server....Took my mom here for a bite before shopping in the nearby stores.  Sat outside, which was pleasant.  Food was OK (I had a BBQ salad that had  no "green" lettuce, just iceberg) and my mom had a burger).  Lava flows we ordered were pretty good and very large.  Service was great until the end of dinner when our waiter was nowhere to be found.   Had to track someone down inside to pay.

Probably will not return.Small. Very small so if your looking to watch a game, may I suggest the Sports Book or Agasies? 

Piss poor Bloody Mary for $10 a double shot. No fresh cracked pepper or horseradish. It's all mix. 

So why come? Your partner wants a coffe or tea at The Coffee Bean and your already rolling in style. Grab a beer for the road to keep you going. But go.I only tried this service a few times, but in that short amount of time I realized quickly this was not for me. I heard about this from a coworker and was super excited to try this service. A random selection of fruits and vegetables and a low price of $15, and then an extra amount to go all organic (I think an extra $10 but its been awhile so I don't quite remember). We did one basket of non organic, and then two baskets of organic produce. We also tried a couple stuff packs and got some of the focaccia bread they offer.

The $15 deal seems like a better deal because you always end up with more produce than the organic basket, which is a shame. You are paying more, you should at least end up with the same amount of food. The two organic baskets I got were so very disappointing. Both times I ended up with pretty much the same produce of very green bananas (that sadly never turned yellow and had to be tossed), an abundance of apples, under ripe mangos, a small pineapple, broccoli, a small basket of tomatoes, a bag of romaine lettuce, some green bell peppers, and a sack of snap peas. And it seems like a good idea because you are eating whats given to you and you make the most out of what you get but that was never the case. Some of the stuff never got ripe, and some others molded within days. It is also nice to have variety which we seemed to not get.

The stuff packs were the best part of this program. I got an italian stuff pack and a mexican stuff pack and both were awesome. I wish I could just buy the stuff packs and not the rest of it. They are also a way better deal. $7.50 for each pack and you get a ton of produce in each one. The bread was ok. We only got to use one of the two provided loaves because it molded so fast. What a shame. 

I always look at the pictures here and think "how come my baskets never looked like that?" Sadly, I will not be returning to this service.I go to this theater a lot since it's close by but it is far from one of the nicer theaters in the Vegas valley. Although they'd recently remodeled and added a couple of giant screen, leather seat XD Cinemas, the regular auditoriums are very dated. Yes, they are stadium seating but the seats are old and very uncomfortable. Want to see a movie in one of the nice new auditoriums? Yep, that'll cost you some extra cash. 

The clientele at this theater is usually a bit "lower quality" than at other movie theaters in town. Expect loads of screaming babies in R-rated films and lots of talking obnoxious teenagers and folks being of the type where you wouldn't want to even LOOK at them cross-eyed answering their cell phones during the movie. I have never had a pleasant experience here. There's even a big ad that runs before the movie saying that if you text on your phone or talk during the movie that they'll kick you out. That's a big lie. I have had to get up several times during movies to go alert an employee and while they will come in the theater and stand around for a few minutes, I have NEVER ONCE seen them ask anybody leave -- even when the offenders were talking right in front of them. 

The absolute worst thing I have ever experienced was a few months ago when I went to see an animated movie. There was a (loud, talking) family behind me in the theater. During the movie, their baby started crying (of course) and they didn't take him out, they just sat in the movie while their kid wailed and wailed. Suddenly, I started to smell poop. It got stronger. Thankfully the movie was almost over. As soon as it ended, they walked out and I STILL smelled poop. I turned around to look and the mom had CHANGED HER BABY'S DIAPER DURING THE MOVIE and had LEFT THE POOP FILLED DIAPER STUFFED INTO THE ARMREST ON THE MOVIE SEAT. This will tell you the "quality" of the customers at this place. 

I try not to go to this theater unless I have to because management doesn't seem to care about the rude behavior of their audiences.The restaurant was clean and attractive and the service was excellent.  The food was average at best.
 
The beef brisket sandwich I had was poor.  The beef was shredded and it had no smokey taste and it was dry.  To make matters worse the bun was stale.

I tried the spare ribs.  There was no smoke ring to be seen.  They were, however, tender, meaty and they tasted very good.  In reading an article about the place posted on the wall, I discovered that they lightly smoke the ribs and finish them off in something like a pressure cooker.   

If you go, I would definitely suggest that you stick to the ribs; no pun intended.  But if you're a hardcore BBQ lover, you'll probably find them a little less than satisfying.Water is nasty!!!
Waitress very Unfriendly 
Slow service!
I would never go back!I went in this afternoon for a mani-pedi.  The shop was empty save for a woman at the nail drying table and one getting a set of acrylics.  The gentleman doing her nails took a couple minutes to acknowledge me standing there and once he did, he grunted to me to write my name on the clipboard.  He then yelled toward the back for someone to come out to help the new customer.  Having forgotten my own bottle of OPI nail polish, I selected one from the display on the wall and sat in the pedi chair as instructed.

My tech, "Jennifer," was friendly enough but hard to understand.  She listened to what I told her about my pedicure and did a nice job.  Partway through she told me she would do a spa pedi (including callus remover, a paraffin foot treatment, and hot stone massage) and mani for $40.  Perfect.  My feet ended up smooth and the polish looks great.  I can't say the same about my hands.  I asked her to file my nails straight across, not curved, but she didn't listen.  She left red polish smudges all over my fingertips and seemed put-out when I asked her to clean it up.  She smudged the thumb and instead of removing the polish and redoing it, she just used the clear topcoat to smooth it out.  I ended up coming home, taking the polish off my fingernails, and doing my nails myself.

I may go back for a pedi, but I'll stick to doing my manis myself.  Definitely not worth $40 combined.Add another "meh" to the list. We went on a Sunday morning, and despite the crowds loitering about, were able to sit immediately at the counter. The crowd was extremely see-and-be-seen, but then I guess it is next door to the (ugh) Vig in (ugh) Arcadia. The service was slow, the server pissy, the order wrong (without an apology), the coffee cup unrefilled. The food was okay, and while there were many tempting things on the menu, I can't say I'm dying to go back. I'll stick to the tried-and-true favorites (read: Harlow's).I have to jump off the Over Easy bandwagon unfortunately. I have eaten there a few times now and it just occurred to me today that I never (and I mean never) have good service. I can make a good breakfast myself if need be and save some scratch.  I go out to eat for fresh hot food and great service. Today my friend and I received neither. 

Upon arrival we sat immediately since we arrived before 8. We were "greeted" by a server In about 1 min and asked if we were ready to order.  I stated we were not but drinks would be great.  We got our coffee within a few mins (which tasted fine). After that no sign of our server for 10 mins or so.  The table next to us was also looking to order from our MIA waitress.  She finally came over and took our order in a fast and courteous manner. The food arrived in about 15 mins but there was a problem......my friend's biscuits n gravy were barely room temperature.  After attempting to flag down the waitress for a few mins she walked by holding up her finger to let me know to wait min.  I don't know if she was being rude but it came across that way. After telling her the problem there was no apology and she walked away with his plate returning about 10 mins later with a hot plate of food. The food itself was good, but not great in any way. Our coffee cups went empty for long stretches of time and our waffle dogs had no crunch to them whatsoever.  After all that they give me the wrong bill which was about 5 bucks short of what we spent. After running my card they came back and asked for my card again and took about 15 mins to redo the bill and charge us 5 buck more. After the poor quality service I would figure they just let it slide since they made the mistake anyway and it was 5 bucks and not 20. 

I feel that there are many places that match the quality of the food at Over Easy and have much better service.  I will no longer eat there.There is a reason this place is not getting good reviews. This place is lost! They serve basically every type of food you can have and to me that means that they can't do 1 type of food very well. 

I went with a large group of people and was able to try their sushi, ribs, turkey club and a few other forgettable things. Not one thing stood out to me at all. It's a shame too because they have a great location and it seems like the owner is willing to sink in a ton of money, but they fail as a good place to grab a bite to eat.La Salsa has been a safe bet for vegetarians and folks looking wholesome fast-food. But this La Salsa Catina inside a mall was dire. The service was fairly ok. But the food was poor. The pizza veggie with black beans tasted as bad as it sounds ;) My sizzling chicken fajitas were ok, but overall we left feeling we should've gone somewhere else.

Damn those vegetarians - it's sooo difficult to take them anywhere! Please eat eggs, fish or seafood...else bring a picnic of straw :)This place is the equilvalent of a grown-up Chuck E. Cheese.... It is loud & there are huge TV's everywhere. The food is reasonably priced and pretty good. I would eat it again. Just not often. We went there for a birthday party and it was really hard to hear anything people were saying, even the people sitting right next to you. I'd have given it 4 stars for the food and prices except that it was just too loud and chaotic there for me. There were about 10 games going on at once on the TV's. Plus, there were pool tables, pingpong, and trivia. With all the of people talking and the music and the games, it was just too much! I wouldnt hang out their all the time but fun once in a while. Oh, The lunch specials are an excellent deal and even come with a beer! How cool is that!?! A free beer with lunch? Awesome!Since nothing at ASU is really free anymore, at least having a free bus system (which won't be free anymore) is nice to take advantage of. Especially in the summer.  unfortunately the orbit, formally known as the neighborhood flash, doesn't quite make the free part worth it.  Sure  its nice that it goes to the little areas that you would usually have to walk to, but since it's free anyone can get on.  If you get a good bus driver he'll probably go the speed limit and stop at the actual orbit stop. Some bus drivers open the doors before they stop as if saying 'tuck and roll'.  I am not trying to get rid of the free service so soon, but if paying a little bit for better service and safety is what it takes...so be it! At least it could fund drivers that won't be texting and smashing the orbit busses into our brand new light rail system.Can't even compete with YC's. Sauces were either blah or strange tasting and overall, just not very good. Its edible, just not as enjoyable.It could have been that I just had an idiot for waiter, but I did not enjoy my experience there. The service is so poor that it completely overshadows very good food. Our waiter took no control of our table only taking our order 30 minutes in when we asked. He also messed up what I think should be a simple drink order (a diet coke with lemon) and confusing medium well with raw. After all this I can not bash the food. The food is awesome! I think Carnevino has forgotten that the little things do add up giving me an overall unsatisfying meal.MEH.  Let me preface this review by saying that I have absolutely no problem with paying top dollar for EXCELLENT food. That being said, I also HATE paying top dollar for mediocre food.

That was my experience at Carnevino.  Mediocre, mediocre, mediocre.  I couldn't believe the prices they charged for the food.  Mario Batali should be ashamed!!  I ordered a couple of appetizer sized portions of the pasta.  They were okay, but the worst part was that the pasta came out COLD.  I had to send it back to get them to reheat it so that I could at least attempt to eat it.  I can't even remember what I had for my main - it was obviously not memorable.  

Avoid this place and spend your dollars elsewhere - I personally love Bartolotta at the Wynn.Poor service, been waiting for my check for 30min! Still waiting after asking another server for it..... Yay, finally, someone else dropped it off, what happened to our server?! :( Left hungry and feel everything was overpriced... Sad because I never right bad reviews but this was not a good first experience...Went out for an early dinner and was quite disappointed. Started out great with the BBQ shrimps, they were delicious, but the main course , steak frites, did not represent what you would expect from an Emeril restaurant. The steak had far too much fat, almost half the steak, and there were no frites but just some fried potatoes. Maybe this is Emerils interpretation of frites, but I was really disappointed. And for the cappuccino or latte the milk was frothed for about a minute and all that was left from the milk is a burned hot white liquid. Quite pricey and unfortunately not what I expected.Update- this place sucks!Cafe Pino is the sort of place I am totally mixed on. I wanted to love it - cute, conveniently near the movie theater, serves late, broad, well priced wine list. But, my experience here was odd at best. 

Went with one of my friends, Meredith G., after a movie. We were never told whether to order at the counter or if we would be waited on, and we basically stood around for a while. Once we ordered, it took a while for the food to be delivered, which was odd b/c we were about the only people there. Also, the owner kept staring at us and coming by every two seconds to ask if we were "ok." This quickly went from friendly to down right annoying.

The pizza and salad we shared was tasty, but the service was a hassle overall.Don't get me wrong about this... The food is decent. I've had better from places like El Patio Mexico etc. My boyfriend and I also made a comment that we feel the need to get a Hepatitis test after eating here.

My main issues with this place are:
A) Dirty dirty dirty. I should have checked around inside before I ordered.
B) Soda machine only worked half the time we were there
C) You do not need to drown everything in guacamole. Guac should ALWAYS be on the side... not the main ingredient in a torta or yucking up half the nachos. 
D) Please get some staff that understand English. Blahblah, I understand this place is a Mexican fast food joint, but when I have to repeat myself a half dozen times to get the order right, only to find guac on everything despite me saying NO to it, I do get rather annoyed. 

If they fixed these few things up, they'd be a really great place. Until then, there are much better Mexican joints around.I just got back from eating lunch at Stacy's.  They offer a pretty extensive variety of items on their menu and we ordered a nice sample of the goods--fried tilapia, fried catfish, rib tips, fried okra/pickles, yams, fries, greens, potato salad, rice and gravy, and sweet potato pie!  I was so excited to find out this place had rib tips because I love sinking my teeth into that yummy cartilage, but the cartilage was slightly overcooked and the meat was kind of chewy.  The fish had an overly fishy flavor to it and the greens were a bit on the salty side.  Suprisingly, the sauces they served with the items came in packets!  We would have thought that the hot sauce and tartar sauce might have been house-made, but it was just the cheap kind from the packet.  The yams were incredibly sweet as was the pie.  The best items were the potato salad and french fries, but I don't go to a BBQ joint just to eat the sides.

Overall, I probably wouldn't go back here since there are always other BBQ places I could try.  Nothing really was wow.... so another one bites the dust.  :(I've been to Rumbi probably a few dozen times.  Worked near the (now closed) Rumbi on Frank Lloyd Wright in Scottsdale and ate there several times.  Have gone to this one in Chandler several times.  I always get the same thing, Jamaican Jerk Chicken.  OK, yeah, call me boring.  So I know what it tastes like.  And it always tasted the same until last Sunday, when it was different.  After a few bites i realized what I ordered isn't what I got.  So I handed it off to the manager looking dude and told him I'd prefer to get what I actually ordered.  His response was to bring it back to my table and try to convince me that what I had was what i actually ordered.  

Bye bye, Chandler Rumbi, I won't be back.  Mistakes are OK, they just need to be corrected.  Explain aways are not OK.Was hoping to cater an event from here, but after sampling the food am looking elsewhere. Managers are pleasant but their food has no flavor. Satisfied Frog is ten times better.I thought this restaurant was decent, it's like an Italian cheesecake factory.  The waiters and hostesses are overly fake friendly, and the italian food is very americanized - big portions, overseasoned, lots of sauce, meat and pasta.

I ordered the caesar salad and eggplant parmesan, the salad was typical, the eggplant parmesan was pretty good, the pasta that accompanied the eggplant was horrible - drenched in oil, undercooked, and lukewarm...yuck!  

At the end the waiter brought out a dessert tray with mini espresso cups filled with a variety of sweets, it is a really good idea, and the perfect size to go with lunch, I picked the apple bread pudding, but it was way too sweet, not so much...this place has a lot of misleading reviews,to be honest I did not like the menu and the idea of someone else making a menu for me with a few questions and then charge a person $30-50. Over priced! 
The place was cool but seen better places with better food. I suggest those who wants to try this place to look @ their menu and think twice about spending $$$ on a small portion of food.I stopped by for lunch for my sushi fix while I was in town. Looking back I maybe should have ordered à la carte. Alas I took a gamble and ordered the sushi/sashimi combo. The service was prompt and courteous. The order arrived quickly, a little too quickly for sushi. The sushi and sashimi cuts were uneven, almost wedge or doorstop-like. And for $30 dollars, not plentiful. The accompanying roll was dry and did not appear freshly made, which may have explained the speed of delivery. The roll had cuts of fish in it which was a bonus. But the outside looked as it was dipped in green tea leaves giving it an unappetizing lichen or mossy look like something attached to a tree stump in a rain forest. Honestly I had a better sushi tasting meal for dinner consisting of seared tuna avocado, mixed greens, etc., in one of the casino restaurants in the same hotel. And it was half the price. This was by far my worst meal the whole week in Vegas.I think the "Soup Nazi" runs the counter service. 

Yes, it's always good to find a good Jewish deli, especially here in Phoenix. And maybe a little big city attitude adds to the ambiance. But is it necessary to provide such rude counter service? Maybe it's cultural? Maybe this place is owned and operated by the "Soup Nazi" from Seinfield? 

I tried to place a big order for my mother-in-law's birthday party. I wanted mini deli sandwiches, mixed fruit salad, chocolate covered strawberries, and mini cupcakes. The guy at the counter told me, in no uncertain terms, that I had it all wrong. You don't want mini deli sandwiches; you want whole ones, cut in half. You don't want mixed fruit salad, you want crudité, you don't want chocolate covered strawberries, they're too messy and expensive, you don't want mini cupcakes, and you want a regular sized cake. Really??? Then he quoted me a ridiculously high price. So what did I do? I politely told him that I'd think about it and quickly went to nearby Fry's (grocery store) and placed the exact order I wanted. I admit that Fry's catering food was a (smidgen) below the deli quality. But given the greatly reduced price (half?) and the customer service, I'm gonna stick with Fry's Food Stores. 

Guess it's a good thing I didn't try to order soup for the party. Surely the Chompies guy would have scowled and told me, "No soup for you."Com'on, Yelp...check out Chris B and Tom K...(is that the names?).  I'll stand by my reviews anytime.

Anyway, my stars just went down to 2.  Any questions why??What the heck! We tried going here for lunch today, they were closed. Their hours posted said that they should have been open at 11, but no, kinda sucks cause we were excited to do something different.

Maybe we'll try again soon.Honestly, the service at this Pita Jungle is the worst. There's always something wrong. (And yet, we keep coming back). The first bad experience was when we asked to move tables because ours was dirty. The server audibly sighed and acted as if it was a huge hassle. The second bad experience was when they brought us the wrong food. Bringing chicken to my vegan friend never ends up well for him or for the wait staff who has to bear the brunt of his fury. The third bad experience happened on the last visit. Dirty cups. Gross.

The food is the same as other locations. Mostly delicious, but often the food is inconsistent. The potatoes are usually tasty, but always come out to varying degrees of doneness. Same with the lentil soup, sometimes it's thick, sometimes its thin. I like the Mediterannean Platter and they get kudos for allowing substitutes (since I don't like their baba ghanoush.this place used to be great now, not so much.  I went this weekend to check out deadmau5 so the place was obviously crowded.  Customer service was absolutely terrible.  The bouncers do nothing but give you dirty looks, the lifeguards who are 90 pound girls in full make-up and jewelry are busy doing their nails and looking in their compacts.  God forbid someone actually needs to be rescued.  A bunch of whales were just throwing cups of water into the air the whole time they where in the pool.  They literally did that for about 2 hours without even being told to cool it.  its ok to get hyped up and do that sometimes but come on.  That stuff doesn't go down at encore beach. Then a douchebag regular pushes me and the lifeguard tells the police and security i pushed a host and i get kicked out.  When my girlfriend confronted the lifeguard she denied what she said but security still launched me.  luckily i was leaving anyway.  I give it two stars because the music is good and i've had fun in the past, but I won't be back ever again.  i'm coming back to las vegas to get cabana service 2 times this upcoming summer and I'll be going to encore beach club or marquee dayclub.  This place is played out.How people can love this restaurant is beyond me. I've been to multiple locations and they were all disappointing. The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is because I thought their breakfast was OK.

Every time I go here I am unimpressed. My food comes out cold, overcooked and overall very bland. The only good thing are the biscuits you get to munch on beforehand. Even the cornbread tastes bland. I didn't think that was possible!

Boring and bland. I'd rather spend my money on The Waffle House.Overpriced crap.

This place tries way too hard to be some trendy noodle house, but it fails miserably with their poor service, terrible food, awful and stupid seating arrangement. 

My noodles were lukewarm when I got them and the amount of peanut butter they put overwhelmed the rest of the food in it. The noodles they had were very basic, I can find significantly superior and cheaper noodle places in Los Angeles....heck, even San Diego!

Our waitress needed us to repeat our orders a few times before she got it. Then, they still got it wrong! She also was rude to us most of the time and its not like we didn't order anything. Everyone in my party order an entree and a drink too, so we were not cheapskates there. As soon as we were ready to leave and just end this experience, we could not find her anywhere. So we finally got up ourselves and went to the front to pay for our real. The hostess didn't even find that unusual that we had to get up and pay. No thanks or anything.

Also, cheesy t-shirts with stupid slogans are lame. Decor looked unique,  I'll give it that, but is it practical and comfortable? Eh, not really. I wouldn't say I was in constant discomfort, but its all style, no substance.

Only plus? Mao Zedong and Elvis Presley napkins.not what i remembered it being as a kid and more then likey i will not be going back.Wow this place has really seemed to go downhill the last couple times we visited over a period of about a year. They are Officially on our black list now. They can not for the life of them cook a MEDIUM Steak LOL it either comes out Black and Blue "Extra Rare" Rare Or Well Done.. Sad really.. Then when you ask them to refire it to medium it comes out very well done LOL Well now me and the wife are now Very Well Done with this place..I don't get it.  It's fine for what it is and the price is decent as well, but nothing stood out.  We ordered around 15 dishes and they were all just...fine.  

One thing that was bothersome was that I ordered the Poached Egg with Sea Urchin and Salmon Roe....I did not realize it also came with a golf ball sized amount of grated mountain yam.  Right when the waitress set it down I asked her if that was mountain yam...she said "yes"  and I said "Oh no, I'm allergic to mountain yam!"   She didn't seem to care and walked away.  Now if the description mention mountain yam, I would not have ordered this dish...but it didn't.  I know it's not right for me to expect that they would just take the dish back, but I did hope that they would have the decency to do so. We left it pretty much untouched and when she came to pick up the dish, not a word was uttered.  =/

I think part of my disappointment came from expectations that were just too high.  I think I'll just stick with Lotus of Siam if I'm going to eat off the strip!Terrible customer service. Both our orders were not fulfilled correctly. Instead of fixing it, the wait staff argued with us. Not coming back.Bad news SR has been hit with the ghostly, unsolvable "sulfur / egg / sewer / hair salon" stink that attacks all Scottsdale businesses that don't complain to the city. I swear there's a valve the city opens and closes to push the odor to the next business when the previous one complains.  I've smelled it from Frank Lloyd Wright to Shea. 

Make no mistake about it, when you walk in it smells putrid. 

Service - Older lady working all alone that can only do one thing at a time complaining about how her arm is going to get a good workout today. Slow to say the least and theres hardly anyone in here. 

Ice Cream - Delicious, original, something that sort of makes the comments above worth it.  

Please, remove that funky air you got up in there.I had a 2 for 1 coupon which is what inspired me to come here for dinner. The veggies were fresh but the meat was only so-so. I had a steak salad and the meat was very thinly sliced- which I liked- but I think it was to mask the grade of the beef.

The food was not visually appealing. And I had to smother my salad in various sauces to get any flavor out of it. The meat again... lacked flavor.

I watched the woman make my salad and she weighed the amount of meat that was to go into the salad. I watched her pile the meat on top of the lettuce and watch a few pieces fall off the side. I then watched her place my salad to the side to be bagged while while she made my friend's entree. She took the meat that fell off the sides of my bowl (which was weighed once already)  and put it on the scale along with some more meat for my friend's entree.

I stood there thinking.... HEY! I've just been shorted some meat and basically charged twice for it!

Honestly, it wasn't a big enough portion to really complain about but people working in open kitchens should know that they're being watched by the customer and that we're all very critical with the way food is handled since we're paying for it and it's eventually going in our tummies.

I have another 2 for 1 coupon and I'll probably give it away to someone else. You won't see me here again.Tried 3 rolls, don't even remember the names. Wasn't the worst I've ever had, but I'll be making a point to avoid ever coming back here. Bad sushi. Ugh.

So many sushi options in Vegas to give this better than 2 stars, especially for the price.I love Sushi and was excited when I moved right down the street from this place. First time go there, they were not quiet open for dinner yet. The girl at the door said they still had another 25 minutes, so I said that's fine do you mined if I leave my order with you and in 25 minutes will you put my order in. She said yes I could do that, and I said i'll be back in about 45 minutes to pick it up and that I would be taking it togo. When I got back they had been open now for about 25 minutes, so I figured it should be ready for me to pick up. When I asked the girl at the door she said it wasn't ready yet, so I said ok and went and sat at the bar. While I was sitting there I noticed that the cook was just starting my order. When I finally get my food and I asked for extra sauce, the guy said he already put some in the bag and was rude about it...but did give me an extra sauce. When I got home there was NO sauce in the bag so it's a good thing I got the one from him. So as far as the service goes, they are not very friendly. The food is a bit pricey, but I have to admit it is very good. I've been to this place twice now and both times the service was bad so although the food is good, I will not be going back to this place.What a disappointing experience. I went in on 10/8/2012 for a late lunch. The crew is so disappointed to see anyone outside of rush hour. It is the most unwelcoming feeling. I could not sit down because of the filthy seat. My husband had to find something to wipe down my booth seat before I could sit down. The busser didn't even seem to notice that there was dirty seats at every table he cleaned. The floor under one table was absolutely filthy. No one blinked an eye. The manager stood and stared out to the floor. He was far enough away to not see anything. Bad strategy. The server completely abandoned us after our food came. She brought me a ketchup with nothing in it and then proceeded to stand at another table and talk for five minutes. My husband had to go get some pico and tabasco for us. We finally interrupted her to get another bottle of ketchup.

I did not like my meal at all. It fell apart. It was dry. They put about a 1/4 teaspoon of hummus on it. It was a black bean burger that desperately needed salt. I had no opportunity to ask for anything to improve it because the server failed to check on us for eternity. My hubby loved his hummus and chicken dish and the caramelized cauliflower/tahini dish was out of this world delicious. That got them an additional star.

This store has completely neglected the details. Their standards have taken a serious dive. I will not be going back until they have new management in place. Cleanliness, and customer service are seriously deficient.So you have steaks and tapas here - we tried the tapas.  Nothing really popped on the tapas menu, it was definately not very extensive, so we tried about 6-7 dishes and everything was pretty meh.  

The lamb lollipops were OK but too fatty.  It's pretty tough when only 1 out of 3 bites is meaty.  Our service was good and they seemed to have some good beers on tap.  The bar area looked OK - this seems like a better place to come for drinks, but then again Fados is right next door so what's the point.  I don't think I'll be back.  

Fireflys is 10x better even if I have to beat down a few club-goers to get in the door.Well we got free passes since we stayed at the Treasure Island...and when we got there it was still super empty....and they were playing trance music that kinda just made me take a good nap....

they had free drinks that night "Lemon Drops" more like lemonade and water!!.... it was hard to tell if this club was going to get any better, and we didnt want to risk it so we left and were planning to come back latr since they had "in and outs"...but we never made it back..... HmMmM wonder if it got better....

the patio did have a beautiful view of the strip and the little "lake" very nice club.Fast no wait seating on a Saturday night! The prices are way higher then they were when Logans first opened, but the food quality is about the same, so not a very good value. The service is very slow once you are seated, and you can only see the TV's from a few seats in the house, so if you plan on having a steak and watching the game, you must be particular about your seat, or go to Texas Roadhouse instead!My wife and I went in on a Tuesday night after shopping (choice of convenience) and I was completely underwhelmed. The service was slow and somewhat lackadaisical not understandable for a Tuesday night at 530. The food was ok but way overpriced for the quality. We tried to like it; we shared wine a starter and our two mains. It just didn't stack up. Not worth the 70 bucks we spent.The service was good and the decor is fun, but I'm not sure that makes up for where The Mad Greek falls short. 

I went early in the afternoon on a weekday and although I was one of maybe six other patrons in the restaurant at the time, the place smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. I may not have even noticed this if it was in the evening as cigarette smoke is not uncommon in Las Vegas, however I found it odd that the restaurant was so large and empty yet the smoke was so strong. 

The menu HUGE but it's very cluttered and thereby overwhelming. Most of the foods on the menu either lack a description or the description is very vague, so if you've never had Greek food before, this may not be the place to start. 

I ordered my food to-go and the hostess (who was very sweet) even offered me a drink while I looked at the menu. The food didn't take long to come out and it was all packed in a plastic bag. 

When I got home with my food, I noticed the bag was wet. I opened it and saw that the tzatziki sauce I ordered was extremely watery (the consistency was somewhere in betwen Italian salad dressing and ranch salad dressing) and was spilling out of a styrofoam to-go box. I found this to be very odd that they would pack a sauce/dip in a standard to-go box. It seems like common sense that it would spill out of it and should probably be packaged in some sort of plastic container with a lid.

Overall, I'd say the food was decent. If I lived closer to it, I might stop in once a while to satisfy a craving for Greek food. But anything more than that is a stretch.Well it's a movie theater. It does serve it's purpose. The reason for the lower rating is one, you can almost always hear what is going on in the movie next door. If I am not watching an action packed movie I fully expect NOT to hear it. I am not a fan of the IMAX. I also get confused when i walk up and they are not selling tickets from the windows outside. The seats aren't as comfortable as other places and the only reason I frequent this theater is because it is less than 5 minutes from my home.I am an avid Chili's goer and know what to expect each time I hit one.  The server was really nice, but the wait was amazingly long. It took almost 15 minutes before we got our drinks and by the time we got out appetizers (Texas cheese fries) the fries were soggy under plastic cheese. The foos was okay (which was 40 minutes after we ordered). The place was no more busy than a typical dinner rush, we even were seated pretty quickly.

I enjoyed my experience, but the food was definitely sub-par, not sure I would probably come back.I'm sad to say that my last 3 experiences at Del Dente's have detracted me from giving it another try. I've been eating here for about a decade and used to look forward to it for the warm atmosphere and tasty food. I don't know if my tastes have changed or if they've had a change in the kitchen, but I've been so disappointed the last few times. The flavours in the food just missed the mark - either too bland or not properly cooked. After eating at amazing places like Nick & Nat's Uptown 21 or Bhima's Warung, I can't justify coming to Del Dante's instead.I am writing this letter as to our dining experience for your special valentines dinner that u offered. First, I would like to say the service was excellent and the ambiance very unique ( although I am not sure about the modern chairs around the bar?)

As for dinner is was completely lacking for a fine dining experience. My salad was some arugula on a plate with 4 dried apricots. Not sure it even had dressing on it and was very bitter. Frogs legs that I had we're yummy. As for my meal,  the veal Oscar, it was way to salty and the lady said she wasn't sure why as they don't use salt. Shrugged her shoulders and left. Hmm.  So then she came to our table and told us she was getting us more meat. she brought me another slice which was raw. I explained to her that I had just gone thru cancer Tx and my meat has to be cooked as my immunity is low. She just said well I went thru all that with breast cancer. 
My husband had the boar dish and enjoyed it 
I found the plates  lacking in any kind of presentation. Just meat on a white plate. 
I would hope that your regular menu is much better. 
After spending 275.00 I don't think we will be dining at verses again.I don't know why this place got 4 stars. I'm from SoCal where Thai restaurants are everywhere and I've been to Thailand so I can tell how good is the taste of Thai food. This place here is even under average compares to the ones in California. 

I ordered Tom Yum, Pad Thai and fried rice. I left over more than half of them. I think their taste is similar to Thai Basil, so terrible. I live right at ASU but I'd rather drive to Yupha's to enjoy my favorite basil seafood eggplant and their special fried rice, or crab fried rice at Thai Rama. 

The service was pretty good though. 2 stars for the service.I agree with what was recently mentioned . . . there are a few instructors that have the music way too loud and the class can't hear them.  Meh.  A yoga studio should be a peaceful place.  If I want to hear yelling and loud music then I'll go to a rock concert.I really wanted to like this place. We got the AYCE and the first 2 rolls were outstanding. The catepillar and tempura spicy tuna roll were just what I was looking for. It went downhill quickly from there. Every subsequent roll was just plain bad. Maybe I'm just not used to Vegas-style sushi (what is up with all of the wacky/sweet sauces--you're supposed to be able to taste the fish, people!), but I just couldn't deal with the weird combinations. The sweet/fruity/mayonaisey sauces that were on all of the other rolls were just disgusting. They overpowered the flavor of everything, so that all you tasted was the sauce. I eat sushi for the fish, not mayonaise. The cajun albacore? I can't imagine a japanese/sushi restaurant outside of vegas selling that as sushi. It was waaay too strong and there was not that all-important fresh fish flavor that you want from sushi. Everyone working there was super-nice and efficient, I just don't think I'm part of their target demographic. If you like sushi with tons of overpowering wacky sauces, come to this place!Decided to order a pizza for dinner and ordered a large Grande Special. The website said the price was $20.95. The girl who I placed the order with on the phone was very nice, she told me the ingredients, and said it would be delivered in around 45 minutes, which was fine. Ten minutes later, the pizza was delivered and I was charged $25.95. The pizza was hot, but that was the only good thing about it. It was soggy, the vegetables were soggy, and it just tasted terrible, especially the cheese. Very dissapointing, will not call again.I only visited the spa and gym because I was actually staying at the Luxor and figured the $15 day pass was really cheap.  Let's just say if I paid anymore, I would have asked for my money back.

First, the place is outdated like the other reviews say.  I understand that this hotel has been around for a while but the spa and gym facilities really need a makeover.  

The gym is worse than a 24 Hour Fitness and the towels smell awful (they didn't even smell like detergent or fabric softener but more of like a chemical smell). 

The lighting in the spa area is awful - think horrible fluorescent ambiance.  The steam room was large and hot but it reminded me of a scene out of gay bath house horror movie - which some people would like I guess.  

The locker room area looked like a grandmother's kitchen with old wood cabinets.  The vanity area was lacking big time - no lotion, hair products, brushes, combs, etc.  

There were plenty of non-alcoholic drinks and fruits.

Bottom line, if you have time to kill and are a gust of the hotel, $15 is almost worth it.The short review: 
1) Bad service
2) Way too salty meats
3) Overpriced
The long one:
We had a party of 15 people and weren't allowed to be seated until our whole group was present because it would be "too much hassle" for our waiter to repeat the "dining instructions" more than once. Are you effin serious?!? With the prices they charge, the waiter should freakin sing and dance while going over their sacrosanct instructions, and do it as many times as necessary.
We were there to have a good time, but instead we were shouted at by our waiter, who was more like a drill sergeant. --no smiles, no small talk. The guy just wanted to shout his schpill at us so he could move on. 
And forget about the little red and green disks they give you. They mean nothing, as the meats kept on coming even though we had ours on red. 
The meats were extremely salty. The salad buffet was just average and you'll walk out of that place a whole lot poorer. 
Vegas has a plethora of excellent restaurants. Don't waste your time and hard-earned $$$ on this one.This is the second time I have been there to get a gel manicure. The first time it seemed like he rushed it and didn't get all the way into the corners and as soon as my nails grew a little it started to peel up. This last time I went, it seemed like the guy did a good job. They looked really nice and kept my nails sturdy. But now less than a week later the gel started separating from my nails and snagging on things and peeling off. I have gotten gels done at other places and they lasted me at LEAST 2 weeks. Every time I have gone here, they peel off in less than a week and they are more expensive.While the food was OK, the service definitely left something to be desired. We had multiple people serving our party, which made it confusing as to who we could actually ask when we needed something. The initial waitress was friendly and helpful but after she delivered our first round we lost sight of her. Our second server we all mistook for the bus boy, and as it turns out was a far more accurate description. After about three people ordered drinks his eyes glossed over and he admittedly couldn't even remember the second persons drink. We would have valued his honesty if he had not also been visibly irritated that such a large group dare order from him. 

The service rant aside, Bogey's hosts a pretty fun trivia night and there specials are plentiful and worthwhile. The bar is large and spacious offering outdoor seating and shuffleboard ( a personal favorite of mine). While I wouldn't go out of my way to frequent this semi dive bar, if that's where to group wants to go, I wouldn't object.Let me preface this fact: I have eaten what could amount to a family of cows (that would be daddy cow, momma cow and 2.5 child cows) in carne asada during my life. Needless to say I like it. This doesn't make me an MD in C.A. but I've had really good (i.e. Yeah, I loved it so much I'd marry it.) and really bad (i.e. Truly thought I'd die.) and everything in between.

That said I'd place America's Taco shop squarely in the middle. Again, it's just my opinion but it was really nothing special. Maybe, and I say MAYBE, I was slightly thrown by the hype and was expecting too much.

That alone though wouldn't have merited my two stars. I eat at plenty of places with just-okay quality of food but I go back because of the atmosphere or service. But the fact that the wait was over 30 minutes for two tacos, a vampiro and a burrito was part of it.

Also, the help was less than, um, help. Two teenagers with that wonderful teen-approach to service. Example, not knowing exactly what an item includes. Lastly, the prices. A vampiro at most places is the size of a good portioned tostada. At A.T.S. however everything down to the burrito was half the size of what I expected, and pricier. I understand the tacos being small as is traditional for carne asada tacos but don't price them $3 a pop. I could get the same quality and half the price at Food City (no joke).

The seating was really limited so this place would probably be best for a pick-up order to avoid the wait.

The positives were that that the food came exactly as I'd ordered it and also they served elote (corn) traditional style which you don't see much outside of late night taco stands. Also, the place was clean and the small house it was built into was neat.Attempt number two-- the yellow curry lunch special.

I ordered it mildly-spicy this time and while it was definitely easier to eat than the medium-spicy (I don't like to sweat or cry while eating my lunch) it still lacked a lot of flavor.  The curry here is also rather thin, the vegetable consisted of mostly half cooked onion, some carrot slices and even less potato along with mediocre deep-fried cubes of tofu. 

The curry isn't bad, but its not great (maybe I am a curry snob). The chopsticks they gave me were just gross. I took a picture but won't post it here.  For all I know, she could have given them to me by accident.  

I really really really want to like this place, but I am disappointed again.  

Even though the lunch special prices are good and its near enough for me to pick up when I am working-- I go back to my office dreaming of the curry I wish ping pong's could be.Went here with my family.  The corn maze was okay.  I was told they used to have people hide in the corn stalks and jump out at you.  They no longer do that so you are basically trying to find your way out.  Entrance is same as the exit so it isn't hard.  We just winged it and you can't get lost.

Area with haunts is interesting.  They have random "monsters" walking around like a guy with a chain saw and a dead guy with a shopping cart with body parts.  They have a rule they cannot touch or talk to you or they'll get fired.

Wouldn't suggest bringing an 8 year old.  My cousin brought his 8 and 12 year old daughters and they were so scared within the first 20 feet that they were crying and wouldn't even walk through to the exit.  My Aunty had to walk them around the outside and wait in the car with them.

My other cousin's 14 year old was also freaked out but I calmed her down enough to go through one of the haunts.  The haunt was okay.  You just walk through corn and there are different settings with people to hassle you.  For instance there was a classroom with a scary teacher.  They did have little kids working which I thought was disturbing on a moral level.  They will pick on people who look scared so they were always in my cousin's daughter's face and left me alone.  

My cousin went through a different haunt and said they screamed once and the rest was lame.  

Overall way too overpriced.  They definitely should let you buy single haunts instead of forcing you to buy all 5.  

Go on the website to print $2 off coupon.For someone who prefers Hilton over other chains, this place was not up to snuff. On the plus side, really liked the location, very convenient to everything. 

On the minus, shame on me for not checking on whether it has a workout room. It does not. Was told they have an arrangement with a sister Hilton hotel nearby, but it's workout room was undergoing renovation. No suggests for nearby places to work out. Had I noticed this when booking would not have booked.  

Overall, the place is ready for a redo. Carpets, etc are worn. The window in my room was jammed open. I failed to mention it to the staff so they had no opportunity to make right. Third floor room shower water pressure was minimal.The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because it is a proper sit-in pizza place that is open after pub-closing time which means there is more variety on offer for the late-night munchies than the usual chips and cheese / curry sauce / coleslaw / gravy / donner offerings.

After a few glasses of red wine at the first Yelp meet-up with some lovely, lovely folks there was talk of Sunday Roast, chips and curd (a Canadian-ism I've yet to experience) but I piped up with Bar Napoli as it was a) close by and b) I'd only ever eaten here after a lot more drinks, at 1am when starving.

The service leaves a lot to be desired. It was as if we were an inconvenience, and they were putting effort into actually not smiling. Otherwise it was efficient-ish (Chris M. never did get his black pepper though.) I shared a pizza, and for some bizarre reason the toppings were spread onto 4 seperate quarters which meant we had to divvy up the different slices. The carobanara got a "not bad" from Chris M. (general agreement that it was a little too eggy) and the tagliatelle with mushrooms was actually not bad.

Reasonably priced, quite clean inside. It makes a change to chips and cheese, but definitely not worth writing home about or a repeat visit unless I'm in the area, it's late and I'm "STARVING" (as I so often complain after a few drinkies).Had reservations and were excited to eat here. Unfortunately, the kitchen was excruciatingly slow, and the waitstaff did not seemed concerned about the delays in the least. The food did not redeem the poor service: scallops were rubbery, spinach overcooked. I wouldn't recommend Fishers in the City.**Summary**
       - Plain - The burgers seemed plain and without any personality. The burger patties seemed flavorless and generic.
       - Overcooked - The wings and sliders seemed way over cooked. We had to add ketchup to the sliders to make them edible.
       - Decor - The decor was interesting. The walls and ceilings were plastered with license plates. The whole place had a rugged route 66 feeling.
**Ordered**
       - Warm Sourdough Pretzel Sticks - They were just bite sized pretzels. Warm and fluffy, but sub par compared to an actual pretzel place.
       - Buffalo Chicken Wings - Dry
       - Peanut Butter & Bacon Burger - It was the burger of the month so I tried it. Other than the peanut butter and bacon, there is nothing else on the burger. It was definitely interesting having the peanut butter, but other than that, it was beyond plain (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg?select=DDcAooDJx4quFJz-S0OHUA#DDcAooDJx4quFJz-S0OHUA).
       - Beef Sliders - The mini patties were way over cooked. They were just hockey pucks of dryness.
**Recommendations**
       - I wouldn't recommend this place. It seems like an overpriced burger join that has dry and boring burgers.I was really excited when my favorite Vietnamese restaurant closed in my area and this one opened up, but was very disappointed after trying it a couple of times.  I'm not sure what the difference is in their preparation, but it just didn't seem as fresh as some other places I've been.  And I thought the staff was unfriendly.  Disappionted to say the least.  I love Vietnamese food, but not here.  

Cute place, but there are better options out there.  :(Don't come here if you're looking for good service. Or really, any service at all.

On my first visit, we were seated for 20 minutes but never served, as we watched the single waitress hurriedly run around the place. Since we were somewhat hungry/thirsty, we left.

Last night was an improvement (at least we were served), but not by much. I had called a week in advance to avoid my first experience and was told they didn't accept reservations but they'd at least make a note to try to keep two tables ready for my party of 10.

No such tables were ready. No host greeted us, and when I explained the situation to the waiter who was also hurriedly running around, he responded: "Guess what? Tonight we're short-staffed, too."

Guess what? Maybe you should hire more people. 

The abruptness continued. We were yelled at to get our IDs ready in advance if we wanted to drink, and when my friend didn't have hers out because she came late, the waiter was visibly annoyed. They didn't bring out my other friend's order with the rest of the dinners (to be fair, they comped her meal after she brought this to their attention). I never got a refill on my water or was asked if I wanted a second drink (also to be fair, their $5 martini is pretty decent). The pizza was greasy and unremarkable, and their fried onion strings were really fried batter strings, leaving the onion to the imagination. 

Perhaps I happened to come on the worst, short-staffed nights. But I wouldn't risk making that mistake again.My wife and I were excited by an Indian place opening up on our side of the valley. Unfortunately the food isn't up to the standard of the better places in town.

The lunch buffet, one of the big selling points of Indian food for me, features some odd choices and they really let it run down in the last 90 minutes.

Bollywood is OK if you're really craving Indian and can't be bothered driving for a few minutes down Sahara to Mt Everest or one of the many other superior Indian restaurants that Vegas has on offer.Prices are really good. And initially over the phone...the girls were really helpful. I called to book appointments for a bridal party, the reassured me that we would be ready by the time I wanted. However when we got there, we weren't even able to start at the same time (like I was promised). 

The manager was extremely unorganized, and the hair dressers didn't even do that great of a job. One of the girls had to re-do her hair because ALL of the curls had fallen out.

I told the girl that was doing my hair that I needed a lot of extra hold hair spray, but it seemed as though it went through one ear and out the other.

I also wouldn't recommend getting make up done by the manager. She didn't do a very good job, and I had to re-do that later as well. 

We ended up being done a half an hour late, and I wasn't even able to finish my hair and make up.

Definitely did not have a good experience there. Bridal parties beware!The fried calamari were pretty  pedestrian. The pasta with clams was ultra salty and impossible to eat. The pasta with asparagus didn't have any asparagus in it (well, only hard unchewable endings that you cannot even bite).

We complained to the manager about our poor experience. He was not too friendly, but to his credit he took the two pastas off the bill (hence +1 star).

UPDATE: I have a suggestion to the chef. If you wish to learn how to cook mussels properly, you might consider doing an internship at Bouchon in the nearby Venetian hotel. And to learn how to prepare asparagus, consider an internship at Julian Serrano at the  Cosmopolitan. I'm sure there are many other places too :)Something about this place just doesn't have me excited to go back. The salad bar is what I would expect at that price point - but nothing too over the top. 

Obviously most people come for the meat...yes the variety is awesome, but the meat is great to so-so to poor. We had an abundance of their least quality steak coming around as well as bacon wrapped dry chicken! In over an hour we only saw many of the meats once. I asked politely three times for the ribs, and after 20 minutes of waiting I gave up. I felt scammed - the pork loin was incredibly dry and a lot of the steak reminded me of zoo animal smells. How many times do we have to say NO to the sausage? I realize it's their cheap filler, but c'mon...

The highlight of the night was the filet, ribs (beef), chicken, the bread, polenta, and the mozzarella. 

It was nice leaving full, but I'd rather grill at home next time!I was disappointed in my breakfast.  The coffee was terrible.  The eggs were average. And the service was well below average. Not a place I would go back to.Don't ask me why I got Fish and Chips... probably not the best thing to order at a place like this, but I did NOT expect it to taste like something out of the frozen food section at a local grocery store!

I expected to be somewhat crispy and have some kind of a taste, but the fish and chips here was bland and SOGGY!  :( I rather eat a McDonald's Fillet O Fish...

The Ahi Tuna Taco was not so bad, but they should probably go easy on the level of spice.  I love spicy food, but for this dish, the spice overpowered everything else.

It was definitely not worth an hour wait...  Probably won't be coming back here again.Rosie's is in a really nice location away from Bell and Grand which seem to be the major avenues for dining options in this part of the desert.  The wifey wanted cheese ravioli, and what she wants she gets, so off we went to try something new...

I've seen more youthful crowds at Hospice of the Valley mixers..  The ambiance is nursing home-esque.

The food was OK.  Not bad at all!! But nothing that would make me crave something from here to make me want to come back.  

The service was a bit slow but not awful.  Dessert seemed pre made..  And the kids SCREAMING in the other room... 

Probably won't be back agian..In the olden days, this pub market the end of the City. Hence the end of the world. Funny how our perceptions change huh?

It's a very touristy orientated pub with frightfully overpriced food and drinks. I came here once and even though I have never pulled a pint, I could have done a better job with the pints they gave us- the beer was still and their was no froth whatsoever. Plus they were making it obvious that they were not happy that only 2 out of the 5 of us were ordering drinks, on a very quiet Thursday night.

I am willing to give this place another shot perhaps, but in the meantime I'll just enjoy the random history about the place.Meh...stayed here because I got to use my Hilton honors points. The customer service was excellent so they get 2 stars but the hotel is a mess! I thought it was newly renovated?!? The bathrooms were filthy! The ceramic on the bathtub was peeling so it looked dirty and the water pressure was so weak! The faucet was leaky so it was annoyed because of the dripping noise. There was dust everywhere!!!  The person checking me in told me I was upgraded to a strip view...ummmm, yeah it was nice to see the side of MGM. Smh! Nice try! If this was the upgrade I wonder what the standard room looked like?!? The small chair in the room was all stained. The bed were comfy enough. All in all...it looked like an old Vegas hotel. I won't be staying here again!The McDonald's equivalent of Greek/Mediterranean food. Everything about this place oozed chain location. The lamb/beef was very salty, dry, and seemed like it had been sitting out in a heat lamp all day. The tzatziki sauce was a bit flavorless, as was the pita bread. Avoid this place if you like flavor, quality, and authenticity.I'm becoming less of a fan of this place. Their food is average, although overpriced.  The items from the bakery (cookies, muffins, bagels, etc.) are pretty good though. I go here very often because I work in the same shopping center, but the convenience does not make up for their horrible customer service. There's a few friendly ones (like Michelle, Chelsea, Amy, and Garrick- all super helpful and always upbeat) but many people work here and the rest are awful.  They act as if you're inconveniencing them and they're doing you some huge favor.  I always have to wait, even if there's employees behind the counter and no line!  They avoid eye contact and walk away and move some pans to act as if they're busy instead of helping the customers.  I'd give it 3.5 stars for food, 1 for service.My Rating: 2.5 Stars

I would rate this 2.5 but yelp doesn't do half points, and i really do not feel the hotel warrants 3 stars. I've been to more than a handful of different hotels, and the expectations for this place were definitely not met.

The hotel itself, i rate it at a 4.
The interior is contemporary, the room layout is standard, but packed with high tech features. The location is close enough to the strip, and there is a definitely "newness" to the hotel. In theory this place really isnt too bad.

Now this is where it failed. . .. .Service.
Upon arrival at 11am, we check in. our requested room was 2 queen standard, as we had 4 ppl. She tells me all of the 2 queen rooms are booked, and they only had king bed rooms. it wasnt until i asked her to check for available 2 queens checking out, did it occur to her to check the "dirty" rooms. Once she found them, she put a hold on them, then returned my ID and credit card. Again, it wasnt until i asked her .. . "what now?" did she tell me to come back and check to see if it was ready. When asking for an approximate time, she told me anywhere to 6 or 7pm. Ok seriously, if thats the case, i think its time for management to do something and fix the hole they dug by overbooking. third time, it wasnt until i asked before she gave me the option of CALLING IN to ask about my room (which, trust me, i did ever 20  minutes out of spite). They also said they couldnt contact me when my room was ready because "they were WAY too busy". Check-in experience: 1 star.

Upon entering the first room (my friend's king bed room) all the controls went haywire. None of the controls worked, lights and curtains didnt respond. The automated features were moving at will, with 10 minute lag response. After calling for support, a tech guy arrived 40 minutes later to reset the system. On another note, the front desk number took multiple tries to even reach a rep, and hold time was on average 5 minutes at least. The front desk seemed to be on overload, and calls were being disconnected and held. Service was untimely, slow, and inefficient.

Other amenities. The Buffet priced at $26, food was mediocre. Not worth the price. American Fish food was ok, but WAY overpriced. $16 for 3 pieces of fish and chips, ridiculous. Portion size was not even worth it. There was nothing that stood out for dining, and we didnt have time to go to the clubs or bars. The actual casino floor, was not big. Tables and machines were actually kind of limited.

Overall, besides the high tech room, Aria has very little to offer. The room layout is exactly what you see in any of the MGM line of hotels, except "fancier". Service is an absolute joke, and the place feels like its run by a bunch of amateur college grads. No one knows what they are doing, and its absolutely chaotic. I must say the place was a disappointment for the standards Las Vegas should currently be at.Ok so I went here for the 4th I had tons of money to spend and was ready to have a great time. 

Got to the hotel and found out my room wasn't ready AND they couldn't tell me when it would be. Mind you it was 4pm. What kind of hotel cannot get your room ready by 4pm. I requested to speak to the manager and magically they found a room for me. 

I got to my room and the view was amazing however I only overlooked two hotels (and that was the "strip view"). 

It took me like 20 minutes to figure out how to open the curtains because the entire room is computerized, cool but maybe a bit much. 

Was investigating the mini-bar and made the mistake of taking something out of it which automatically charged my room. LAME. 

Room service is GROSS. Don't even bother getting something from it.

Also, the casino is so crowded and full of tourist it doesn't even feel like Vegas.

Overall, nice hotel but go elsewhere.The Aria is a beautiful hotel, but the service and design leaves a lot to be desired. I didn't meet one happy staff member during my entire time checking out their casino. Furthermore, the whole campus is intentionally designed to keep you from leaving. The traffic loop outside makes it virtually impossible to get back to the Strip. Poor signage shows that they intentionally try to trap you so that you stay at their location, which is bad sportsmanship in my book. All of the other casinos on the Strip have clear, frequent signage that show what exits to take to get to other casinos, even if that casino is a competitor owned by a different chain of properties.

I'll allow for 2 stars because of how pretty the place is, but for the service and bad business sportsmanship, they're not going any farther.This is just ok. The freshness and quality of fish is not the greatest. The yellowtail looked dry and questionable. I am more of a nigiri fan than anything so this review is based on that. 

I came here with some Kaya regulars that had not been here for a bit. According to them some of the items that were on AYCE menu are no longer and or have shrunk in size. 

The service is in dire need of improvement! So slow! Inexcusably slow and waiters or waitresses don't pay attention or do it on purpose! I see why there is a 90 minute usually there is 60 min limit they run you out of patience by forgetting about another order. 

One of my fave things to order is Ikura... The  lack of salmon roe is very noticeable. They cover enough for you not to see its all rice. 

One thing I did enjoy a lot was baked muscle but that was the only highlight.I have stopped by Tuvalu once or twice now after work in Verona.  I want to support local and am a supporter of Just Coffee.  Although I was impressed by the small-town cafe's emphasis on Fair Trade and Local offerings, I was really put-off by the same barista (who I am pretty sure is the owner!) each time.  Didn't acknowledge me walking in the door.  Didn't even look at me while taking my order - wasn't even sure she was talking to me.  Didn't say thank you, didn't smile.  Another woman (older) was also working the 2nd time I stopped by (today) and she was much kinder.  Smiled and took my tea order, making changed.  I tipped because she was nicer.  The first barista was also rude when I asked for more hot water - didn't say ANYTHING!  Barley looked me in the eye and seemed annoyed.

From the sounds of it she is nicer with the regular customers- I have heard her interacting with them and she seems nice enough.  Really dislike cafes that aren't friendly to new customers - why shoot yourself in the foot?There are far better places in Vegas to watch sports.  This place is very dirty and in need of an update.A few hits and too many misses...won't be ordering from them again. Soggy stuffed grapes leaves, cucumbers wilted, yuck. Initially I liked this place.This was my third time eating at a Serendipity, my second time at the Serendipity 3. Last time my boyfriend and I ate there I remember it being kind of fun and cute. This time I returned with my mother, and the experience was so poor that I can't believe it's the same place. 

The first thing I attempted to do was use the $4 drink offer from Foursquare. It said it was for "a specialty drink or draft beer." My waiter told me I could only choose a rum and coke or a Miller Lite. Umm, no thanks. Take that offer down if you don't want to fulfill it. 

We ordered chicken nachos and macaroni and cheese. We also had a coupon from our hotel (Paris) for a free Frrrozen Hot Chocolate. Frozen hot chocolate came, and it was alright. Not as good as I remember. 
Nachos were good, and the portion was huge. Thanks for that, since my Mac & Cheese was so salty I had to send it back. Not before being chastised by the waiter complaining about it. 

This place could be so good with some decent servers and a little updating. The people watching is great, and the location is great, but the experience was terrible.I've came here twice thinking maybe my first time was a fluke but I was wrong.  The wait both times was always 30-40 minutes which I could understand considering its right smack in the middle of the LV strip.  The thing I liked though was you could give them your cell number and they text you a link to tell you how many parties and how long of a wait you still had so you could wander to a near by bar or the casino to play some slots until you are texted your table is ready.  

Ok on to the food.  I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs thinking that it's pretty complicated to mess something as simple but I was wrong.  The sauce was bland and the meatballs had no flavor at all either.  Not to mention they don't even serve it with a piece of garlic bread.  Instead a cold piece of regular white bread that was probably sitting out for a while.  The noodles were some kind of fat version of spaghetti noodle which was kind of odd.  

My date had their cheeseburger which I don't know how they could mess up but they still managed to.  She ordered it medium but it came out more like well done and left there for a couple minutes extra.  The outside was burnt and crispy and the juiciness of the burger was lacking.  At least the French Fries were good though.

On to the dessert.  We ordered the deep fried Oreos with cookies and cream ice cream.  It looked a lot better than it tasted.  When I think deep fried Oreos I think of cake batter on the outsides but they used corn flakes which made it taste awful.  The corn flakes are way too crunchy.  ended up just tossing the rest of the Oreos and just eating the ice cream which was ok.  Definitely not worth the $17 at all.

If you ever come here I recommend eating prior and just coming for the dessert.Overpriced mediocre food. $18 Spaghetti was GOD awful. $13 or $15 Sliders (4) sans fries had diameter of 1.5 inch. Frozen hot coco was underwhelming at best. Vegas has more to offer than Serendipity.Service is very very very slow.expect at least 45 minutes wait for your food.
Food was OK., Ordered the Dinosaur Ribs and was good  the desert  was very good.
I am giving 2 stars because we kept waiting for more than 30 minutes in line to get in when we saw many people arriving later and getting in before us, when we ended up checking with the waitress she basically confused and put us on hold.
Overall was a ok placeWe ordered two, 2 entree take out dinners and one Panda Bowl. On one of the meals we were charged an extra dollar for crispy shrimp which was never delivered. The chicken appeared to be mostly pieces of chicken skin and breading and the Mongolian beef was tough and stringy. Most of the meals were overwhelmed with a very dry rice concoction that was supposed to be fried rice. We also never received any soy sauce so we could at least moisten the rice into an edible state. These were very disappointing meals that cost a total of $18.82 that did not include a beverage. It was a waste of money and a waste of time. I would recommend against patronizing the particular Panda Express. Because of our experience here, I probably will not patronize any more Panda Expresses... and let me tell you folks... I am not a very picky guy... but this. place was really a disappointmentAfter some noshing at the Fly, some of the Yelparazzi rolled to Town Square to meet up with our farewell girl, Angela's, friends. They were at Cadillac Ranch....I never thought I'd ever walk in here because this kind of place is everything I'm not, but I'm up for an adventure. Some of those "not my scene" places have changed my mind before, but this visit solidifies why I didn't step in here on my own volition. 

It was half off drinks so decided to grab some libations and from advice of people who've been- we skipped out on food. I got a Leguntas IPA off the draft and it was bad. I know that this was either old or the keg wasn't properly cared for because I know what this beer is supposed to taste like on tap. This was off. This place isn't really a crowd that is ordering much of the IPA's and the Lagers so they probably sit while the "Lites" are getting switched out like hotcakes. Even so, staff should watch the kegs more carefully and drain pour old stuff as needed. I was impressed when I saw something not typical Bud/Miller/Coors on the tap so it made my disappointment worse when it couldn't even be fresh. I didn't complain because it was 3 dollars and we already sent back some incorrect black and tans. 

Some of our party wanted a "black and tan" with Guinness and Sam Adams Boston Lager.....waitress didn't know what this was so when it came mixed instead of split, it made us think that they poured it from the draft and not properly spooned in to separate the beers. Someone later came and said that the weights aren't correct to do the split and gave them a "Black and Blue" (Guinness and Blue Moon) instead. Though we couldn't dispute the weight issue at the time, I later got researching. Guinness with Sam Adams does indeed exist as a "Patriot Pint"....I am waiting on a beeradvocate answers if this indeed is split or is blended together. 

We didn't know it was a Band Battle on the locals night so it was way too loud to talk inside. We are talkative folks so it dampened things. Sorry Vegas, but talent isn't up to par with other big cities so I didn't care to stick around. The band playing sounded alright, but made some major sound errors and were pulling out their sounds, ripoff, not inspired by people who came before them. One being an ex (I'll never tell), so I know well when people are arranging their music like his. 

Yeah, I'm an asshole for saying so, but I'm an asshole with a music collection sitting at home that literally enough to open a music store, a music set up and friends in high places in the industry. Until some quality band (Panic does not count because they don't know how to play live) out here makes it big time, then anyone bitching at me how wonderful the local scene is wrong.  Scenesters, go cry to your Edward Sharpe album and if you see their drummer, Josh, tell him he owes Jade (me) some bubble bath bombs. Enjoy music by all means as it is the greatest mediums in the world, but don't try to convince me out of things I know to be true.  

After 30 minutes of attempting to yell a conversation and half drunk beers, we went downstairs to the Yardhouse for some serious brews from well cared for taps. 

Sorry, but this place isn't the kind of bull I like to be riding this late at night.Rare120 is style over substance. It's a steakhouse that caters to clientele more concerned with getting their drink on in a stylish setting than eating quality food. Don't get me wrong, the food isn't awful, but compared to other steakhouses around town it just doesn't measure up.

The complimentary pretzel bread wasn't warmed up enough. Parts of the outside of each piece were warm but after tearing into it I realized that the inside was cold and the texture of it was overly dense.

The crab cake appetizer came out looking like a deep fried hockey puck. There was plenty of crab meat and not much filler in it, but that didn't make up for it's dry taste

For entrees, I got the braised short rib. It was a huge slab of meat (off the bone) that was almost fork tender, a little too fatty, and was accompanied by an intensely rich sauce that needlessly amplified the saltiness of the beef. My wife got the 6 oz. filet, which turned out to be the best dish of the night. They are a steakhouse, afterall, so they get points for putting out a filet that was tender and had a nice char to it, although it was slightly under seasoned. 

We shared a side of their trio of mashed potatoes. My favorite was the lobster,  which had several succulent chunks of lobster laying on top. The sweet potato mash was decent, and the truffle mash was good for a few bites then the truffle taste become too overwhelming. All were incredibly rich, buttery, and creamy. If you're trying to eat healthy, this isn't the dish for you.

Service throughout the night was spotty. We wanted a second round of drinks but finished our meals before the waiter ever made it back to our table (although he did check in right after we got our food). I have no idea how many tables each server had, but they were clearly understaffed, as evidenced by every single employee speed walking back and forth trying to get everything done.

The highlight of the dinner was the comfy, plush booth we were seated in which made for a cozy dinner and a good spot to people watch.

Damn you restaurant.com for enticing me to come here with your discount gift cards (which our server forgot to deduct until we reminded him). If it wasn't for that, we probably would not have tried this place. And, now that we have, there's little chance we'll ever be back.The reviews for this place are good. Not sure if we went on a bad night or what. I liked the margarita... But they are very pulpy. Not everyone likes chewing their drink. I had the carne asada burrito. I think it would normally be good, but the meat was too charbroiled and left a burnt taste in my mouth. The chicken enchiladas were very good I was told.For the price?  ...hell yes I've experienced better!  Place is alright but not work the price.  If you're big on golfing and too lazy to drive or 90 years old, this is your spot! Enjoy it.Ugh.  It was 10pm and we wanted a bite after the flight.  It was the first place we stopped by and they lied to us and said they were the only place open.  

The place looks really cool!  It's airy and light and has a really cool glass water fall.  Unfortunately the food was slightly soggy and not what I was expecting for the price. They couldn't seat us in the section we wanted (by the really cool water fixture).  Service was very slow.  I had to ask for the side of berries my waffles were supposed to come with.

Hopefully they'll get their act together and make a cafe worthy of that glorious space.I was pretty disappointed with this place. It was late at night so other food option in Aria were shut down so we went here. The decor and ambiance for your typical Vegas Hotel 24 Cafe was the best part of the meal. An open view from the front of the Hotel was nice.
The food was over priced and didn't taste very good. Also, we got sat in a booth that was literally shaking from the bass coming from the club... good for the club, not for Vettro Diners. I had a steak, it came overcooked. 
I would suggesting doing the modest little walk over to Monte Carlo and eating at their Cafe.. that have a good Ruben.I have been to various Thai restaurants and hole in the walls are better than this place. Their food is greasy! I expected this place to serve good Thai food being in a casino, but was I wrong. If you go, just bring a bottle of Tums and you are set. I give 2 stars vs. 1 because their Thai iced tea was delicious :-)Came here with my husband for lunch. He had the burger and I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, both from the $6.99 lunch menu. I'm glad it was only $6.99, because unfortunately it wasn't that good. 
My husband burger was just that,a regular burger. In n Out across the street have (way) better burgers. Now, my pulled pork sandwich. The BBQ sauce tasted mostly like vinegar and salt! The fries were very salty and if you know me you know I love salt.  At least the waiter refilled our drinks constantly. 

We really liked 56 East and were sad when it closed. We finally got a chance to try Fired Up Grill but it didn't deliver. 

The service was good, nothing to complain there.We live very close to this place and WANT to love it so badly, but instead we always leave WANTING.....

The ambiance is fine, as are the prices, but where is really falls short is on taste. The descriptions always sound great, but there is a lack of refinement in the flavors. This past time around we ordered the mussels marinara for an appetizer, and then the chipotle cavatelli and steak salad for entrees. The only flavor present in the mussels was black pepper. That's it. I couldn't taste the tomatoes or garlic at all... The steak salad came out exactly as it was listed- a bunch of ingredients, but no melding of flavors. The steak wasn't seasoned, the onions were raw. And the cavatelli was poorly executed as well. The pasta (which is similar to a gnocci) was gummy and starchy. Again, the only flavor was smoke- the poor green chilis, roasted corn and black beans were a useless sacrifice to the dish.

We'll probably go back ONE more time in an effort to help support our local eateries, but we hope in the mean time, the owner will read some of these negative reviews, upgrade the food execution and take this restaurant to the level it aspires to be.I received one of their introductory 1 hour Swedish massage for a steal of $49.99 + gratuity. The place was very clean and modern. Initially they ask you to fill out some paperwork and also opt out of areas of your body you find off limits. 

The therapist was calming and pleasant. The space was clean with dim lights, warm clean sheets, and soothing music. I also had the option of lavender or eucalyptus aromatherapy which was complimentary. I opted for eucalyptus which consisted of just three sprays into my nose. I didn't smell it in the pillow or anywhere else. The music was soothing, but I wish they offered a choice...sure the new age hippy crap music is all the rage, but personally I'd have preferred the sound of the ocean or something to the effect. Not Yanni.

The therapist was not that great at all. She identified some areas (my neck and shoulders) that needed major work, but she didn't apply nearly enough pressure to do anything. I felt like she just kind of rushed through everything. She did attempt to get a knot from under my right shoulder blade which felt like this just got real and I am really in Hostel 4. It felt like torture. There are better techniques for getting knots out, just sayin'. You get what you pay for, for sure! 

At the front they try to upsell on you pretty aggressively on their monthly membership, but considering my underwhelming experience I shot that down real quick. I did not feel any benefit from that massage at all. I might have just gotten unlucky with the masseuse I was assigned.We waited 30 minutes from seating to eating and we did not order the baked pancakes that take 20 minutes to cook.  The eggs were a grey/green color inside and overcooked.  The pancakes were good, but not enough to make up for the rest of the experience.  We won't be back.I just noticed that this place had opened and did pulled a u-turn to go try it out in the hopes I might get another first review. Once I got in I was a little confused because I didn't realize it wasn't a sit down and order type place. Instead you go up to the counter place your order, take a seat, and your order comes out to you. So I start looking over the menu I see the familiar mediterranean fair, but I notice a difference. They make their hummus and baba ganoush with yogurt. Instant turn off.

Despite this I decide to give the place a chance and I order a vegetable skewer and plato's potatoes. Turn's out plato's potatoes is just french fries with another name. I think ate two or three and gave up. The vegetable skewer was pretty decent and actually had a hunk of peach in it, which was a nice twist. Unfortunately that was not enough to make up for everything else.We hadn't been there since it opened and should have known better then to come back.  The food was typical restaurant chain and average at best, the exception being the rolls.  The service was less than average with the wait for our entree's being way too long.  There are so many better options locally and I would suggest using them.The cupcakes we're alright the icing I was not a fan of . The cream cheese frosting doesn't taste a thing like cream cheese frosting more like buttercream. There was also way to much icing on these cupcakes and I could taste the grains of sugar in the icing. If you want a great cupcake skip this place and go to  Sprinkles in Scottsdale.I came in today purely because of location and proximity to other errands I had to run. When I walked in I was immediately and warmly greeted by a hostess who's name tag read April. I said hello back and let her know that I was just killing time while new tires were being put on my vehicle next door. She said great come on in and let's get you seated. She sat me, handed me my menu with a smile and said enjoy your meal. A++ for her, she was terrific. Moments later my server came and warmly greeted me too. The receipt says her name is Kelsey. I explained to her that I just wanted something small to pass the time. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful in helping me narrow my decision. Although I didn't voice my dissatisfaction with my meal she was very attentive to my needs throughout my dining experience. A++ for her too. What wasn't so good was the actual food itself. I ordered the beef taquitos. The shells were stale and chewy, not crispy and crunchy. Just awful. The beef wasn't any better as it was dry and lacked flavor. On the bright side the guacamole was decent. Actually it was the only thing that kept me from sending the dish back. So I asked for a side of sour cream and drizzled on some salsa from the complimentary chips & salsa. I made it work, but I was not really happy at all. So a bit later I get the call saying my truck is ready, I get my bill and I was shocked to see that the tiny ramakin of sour cream cost $2.00. Now it's as if they are trying to upset me on purpose. $2.00 for that little thing is ridiculous. 
Overall my service and hospitality was great - it's the only reason I'm giving two stars, but the food and certain price points leave a lot to be desired. I may or may not be back but I certainly won't be making it a destination place or referring friends.Review for order placed on 9/8/13. This is a place I have been to 30+ times to order take out in the last 4 years. I love there pizza, entrees, coupons, etc. I have been twice this year with very subpar results. Yesterday I found out that they changed owners or management, which made me skeptical. Apparently i should have trusted my instincts. I ordered takeout and they would not honor my coupons, they informed me of new management or owners, ok whatever. When I picked up the order I made sure to ask for a plastic bag to double bag the paper one given. Good thing bc this thing leaked oil ALL OVER THE PLACE. The bag looked like it had a philly cheese steak from Geno's in it. My leather seats would have been ruined. Not to mention the girl at the counter basically rolled her eyes when I asked for the bag and double checked my order in front of her. . I asked for some minor changes to 1 dish, extra meat sauce to the lasagna and a side of sausage. There was little to no meat sauce on this lasagna AT ALL. It was 80% cheese and was just awful, i ended up throwing half of it away. My gf got the Fruiti de Mare and didnt even make it 1/2 way thru her dish before she had the RUNS! Totally unacceptable. I highly doubt I will ever order from this place again. I can think of a better way to spend $30. such a shame. Bye Macianos, we shared many great football Sunday's together but I think that was the last.

UPDATE*************

Spoke to several people there this evening. The "Manager" was some guy, couldnt hear his name, but could not find my order history for 15 mins, kind of a joke. However i did speak to a Marinka? Who was very nice and actually apologized and refunded my order. That was pleasant as I was only calling to give them my 2 cents. Guess I will give them 1 more shot and hope next time is great like all the previous times.I want to like this place as it is so close to my house, but their food quality is too hit and miss. This time the pizza was okay, but the bacon ranch fries have apparently changed since the last several times we ordered them. It was obvious one of the cheeses they put on the fries was like Kraft singles and it was disgusting in combination with the other ingredients. We couldn't even eat it.Whenever I eat in the restaurant the wait staff is usually quite poor. They don't come to your table often enough which leaves you unable to eat without having a drink to help wash it down.

Overall, just poor attention to detail in quality of service and food quality.Not really a true brewery... It's a small room inside the 4 Queens. The "brewery" is offsite 7 miles away. 
As a home brewer the beers were nothing I couldn't make at home myself... Maybe I should talk to 4 Queens and I could get a brewery! LOL
Unless you just want to check another "brewery" off your list... Not really worth checking out.When I came to this location only one girl was working window and front. I literally waited 10min to even get an order and while I was ordering she was trying to make a milkshake and get drinks for the drive thru. I felt bad for her I could tell she was stressed so I bit my tongue. But sadly they messed up my order too. I wanted the new 6 burger with the homemade bun but instead I got the regular bun. Which is the whole reason I went there was to try it. I then had to wait another 10 min for them to get me a new burger. 

Tip to management: you are running your floor thin and understaffed. You may not have a lot of hours to use cause of a slow location. But experience of customers is key. Plus over working your employees! Get someone else in there to help with the windows so the people who do choose to come in and enjoy your service can actually enjoy it!!!Service is average can;t ask too much as we stopped by for a breakfast we didn't expect.

The biggest letdown was the chicken congee.  The presentation was cute with a few side dishes going with it.  But gosh...it tasted like gel, gluey and weird.  Ew...how can a chinese hotel made such a awful congee since this is such a basic chinese comfort food??  I was so tempted to send it back..

The French toast was better but not much.  It was so small and too sweet while nothing on the side.  Considering $20 for these two little pieces of lonely toast, this is a total rip off.

You know what, CVS and Walgreen are near the hotel, we should grab a carton of milk there instead.Yelpers-how many times do you have to be told-3 stars on Yelp means mediocre.  I went against the system & tried Lagasse's Stadiuum.  Awful.  Very uncomfortable seating in front of the main screen, greasy blah bar food.  Emeril must be hurting for $ if he puts his name on this establishment.  Great place for a guys outing.Jason and I used to go to this place for their.. ahem. Bacon Donuts. Yup, I said it. Delicious chocolate or maple frosted raised donuts with either a whole strip or crumbled bacon pieces on it. They were heavenly. Equally as heavenly was the apple filled donuts they had the first time we came around. The service on our first visit was phenomenal, the girl at the counter was super helpful and not at all annoyed when we asked for a minute to look through the selections or asked questions.

What the hell happened since then? The 2 times we've been back, no matter how early we seemed to get there (I think most donut places should have all offerings at 8-9am still) there are NO bacon donuts, and NO apple filled donuts. When we ask about them, all we get is this nasty attitude from the girls at the counter since. Like I should know better to ask about the apple filled when behind the sign that says "apple filled" has jelly donuts. Ugh!

Anyway, I doubt we'd be back. We were thinking the service the second time was a fluke. Our mistake, clearly the good service we had the first time around and their bacon and apple filled donuts are all fluke occurrances.I love DB so have been curious to try Revo out.  I went there today and had a vegetarian burrito with a wheat tortilla, a sugar-free(stevia) lemonade, and a gluten free chocolate cake thinggy.  First, the food - meh - it was okay - the rice was moist and the veggies crispy - but there was absolutely no wow factor.  Good thing they put salt in the take out bag too.  If you do not absolutely love stevia - and/or licorice flavored lemonade, don't go there - I wish they would just have it unsweetend and let you add your own poison - mine would be truvia - the cake thinggy was chocolatey - and the white stuff in the middle was tasty - and it was gluten free - so for a gluten free cake, it was pretty good - but again - no wow.  But then, maybe this type of food is not intended to have "wow"?  I felt kind of like I do at True Food.  In my heart of hearts I am not really loving this experience - but I am thinking that I am doing something GOOD for my body - so, as with exercise - I hope there is some gain with pain - maybe better antioxidant levels or something - NOT weight gain.  This healthy journey ran around 15 bucks - not unreasonable for what I got.Ok, I wince when thinking about writing a less than stellar review of a place but I was so disappointed in the Tempe Farmers Market. I walked in with my reusable cloth grocery bag planning on walking out with it filled. Instead I walked out with 2 tomatoes, that is it. The main reason was I felt the prices were really high on almost everything. I have a Sunflower market near my work and house and could get 3 times the amount of food for the same price. Also a lot of the produce looked a bit wilted and there really wasn't a great selection. The staff was friendly however and hopefully in the future the prices will be more reasonable. I still don't get how something that is grow or produced nearer than the stuff that gets trucked in is so much more. My pocketbook would not let me spend so frivolously!Prices at mad pita are pretty cool, the service is great, there's fishes floating around in vases on the table...

And...my gyro meat wasn't roasted and carved off the spit how I like it :(

Gyro meat is in strips and fried on a skillet top; not how I prefer. The lettuce and veggies were fresh, the tzatziki sauce was yummy as was the feta, but the meat and boring pita killed my gyro experience. Boyfriend got the falafel, he said it was yummy, overall more satisfying than my meal (as usual).

Not sure if we will head back for round 2...I need my satisfying gyro fix! 
I ordered the baklava for dessert, it was a little different than the traditional Greek style I have had before. Really buttery but otherwise a little bland.Not a massive fan of the show so if you are then i am sure you will rate it higher. Disappointed you can only solve 1 case, it is really easy to solve and make sure you do the stations in order. we were waiting for one station when the girl who worked there pointed to another station further down, bad idea as it answered half of the answers including who owned the gun and pretty much solved it for us. The girl who let us in at the main desk was HOT HOT HOT!!!. Defo the hottest girl in vegas,worth it just for her :-))Love the burgers....however I just want to drink water...so I get a tiny cup..ask if I may have a bigger cup..no that is our policy...seriously.  
So I asked for 3 tiny cups...well guess what...those 3 cups cost the same amt if not more that a small cup..
Our policy is a terrible response at any business..Not good. The outside seating is remarkable in itself. The view of the fountains, the ambience and the general people watching is some of Vegas's finest but the food? Yuk. The service, sad. We had appetizers and drinks...during what they call happy hour. The servers were far from happy. Each one looked and acted miserable. No smiles, no small talk just sad. The food was like frozen appetizers from your grocers freezer. And the frozen margarita special was lame. The cup was so small and a hundred of them wouldn't have given you the slightest buzz. Total dissapointment. Never again, no matter how hungry I am or how cool it looks. This place sucks.***I am not familiar with dance clubs so I am not sure how well HAZE measures up to other clubs, but this one seems to fall short based on other Yelp reviews here; for me, the club had a very boring look (a big, dark and completely forgettable space with a bar here and there and occasional seating); given that this club is on The Strip and located in the new and well-designed and upscale Aria hotel, I would suspect a much more thought out and creative look and atmosphere***

Aria like all the other major casinos and hotels on The Strip offers complimentary self and valet parking.I just tried this place 2 nights ago.  It is the only BBQ place within a 20 minute drive or so.  I was hoping it would be good....god I was hoping it would be good.

I called at 7pm (They close at 8) and asked if they still had ribs today.  The owner ended up getting on the phone and told me he has plenty.  I then asked him what he would do with the rest in 1 hour and he said freeze them.  He said that sometimes the ribs wont get eaten for 2-3 days.  ACK!

I asked if he had fresh ones and he told me yes.  I drove over there in 2 minutes and he began MICROWAVING the ribs.  I asked him what he was doing and he said "warming up the ribs"  I was in shock.....had I been wrong about all the BBQ places i've been too?  Do they too microwave their ribs in the back and then serve it to me?  I decided not to judge yet.  I asked him where his smoker was at and he said it was at the Buckeye location.  Huh? So where is the meat made I asked....He told me Buckeye makes it...then delivers it to them later in the day.  Bleh...ok ok dont judge yet Ron...eat it first I said.  I got home and split the rack with my roomate.  I ordered it sauce ont he side so I can gauge the flavor of the meat....and I am SUPER glad I did.

The sauce tasted like tangy ketchup.  The Meat?  Well it tasted like Microwaved Ribs...what else?  You ever have left overs from a BBQ place and try to microwave them?  It was EXACTTLY like that.

Wow...I give this place my ultimate "edible" lowest rating. (I really wont give a place 1 star unless it was unedible)

Do yourself a favor and drive the extra time to a real BBQ Joint.had a burger from here on a pretzel bun.... it tasted like an over cooked hockey puck... the fries here tasted like deep fried potatoes.... they kept playing "red solo cup" on the juke box, it was funny the first 30 seconds into it, but the 4 time i heard it i felt like cramming a a red hot steak knife into my ear drum.  I probably should have.I'm not going to lie.  I expect a lot out of a restaurant on the strip.  Furthermore, I totally thought this was the ESPN Zone.  I guess that license was removed for some reason.  I doubt I would have bothered coming here if not for the ESPN license.

Also, it was my birthday and my friends told me later that they tried to get something--you know birthday song, a tiny scoop of ice cream, shoot a paid dessert with a candle in it.  The most they would do is put a generic greeting on the sports ticker.  It was unique but the message wasn't even personalized.  The message kept scrolling throughout our meal and halfway through a second birthday greeting to someone else ran right behind my greeting.  Honestly, I feel worse for the poor soul whose greeting had to follow my greeting every time.

My buddy and I shared the Tailgate Party Platter which included a quesadilla, hot wings, buffalo wings, four sliders, artichoke dip and chips and some pork ribletts.  The quesadilla and artichoke dip were disappointing.  The cheese had cooled and wasn't very stringy or tasty.  The sliders were well done and the meat off the ribletts came right off the bone.  The hot wings were good, but nothing special, while I thought the buffalo wings were sub-par.

Bottom line:  I think this place is past it's prime.  I remember trying to get in when it was the ESPN Zone in 2007 and it was packed.  Now it seems like it is just living in the shadow of what it used to be.  I guess it falls in line with the trend that anything south of the Citycenter in Las Vegas is struggling to keep up these days.  Find another place to eat and catch your game.Overall it was a ok place. I would never come here again though. This was my first time on the strip and we decided to have dinner here. Well our waiter tried to sell us wine and we ask what he thought would go good with what we wanted to order. He looked as if he didnt know but made up some stuff just because we told him we dont drink wine. So ended up not ordering the wine because of that. So we got Calamari as a starter and it was burnt. literally. burnt. We returned it and i dont know if im just spoiled or not but the manager never came out to talk to us. I thought that was common practice but o well. watever. the next batch to come out was good not great but we ate it. The only thing that saves this place is the fact that my wife loved her dished but i hated mine. If you can stay away from this place. My wife is just to nice sometimes!Umm good concept, but not gourmet! Friendly staff nice atmosphere but food was pretty disappointing except curly fries. They were fresh and delicious! Food was very plain and tasteless. My 11 year old whips up yummier tastier grilled chesses. It was plain plain plain. Not gourmet at all and 40 bucks for two drinks one order of curly fries , four sandwiches and and a soup it is overpriced! Not to mention soup was more like watery flavored cheese. I don't think I would be back only for curly fries, was disappointed with price and quality of food I forgot to try desert. Oh well lesson learned..Just not worth your time or money.
I'm from the south, and the thought of having some good southern-cooked food sounded great for our Valentine's Day lunch.  I ordered the catfish dinner.  The catfish was good, but the hushpuppies were less than stellar, the fries were cold, and the slaw was "OK".

My date ordered the grilled Mahi-mahi.  The fish was tough (not flaky as it should have been).  The sauce was good, but not enough of it.  The rice was great.  The green beans were a big disappointment.  As I said, I'm from the south.  We like our green beans COOKED, with a touch of bacon and maybe some onion.  These green beans were, as our waitress told us, cooked "al dente" - way too crunchy - almost raw.

The beer taps were not working, so no draft beer - only bottled.

To top it off, the mood in the place made me feel like I was at a funeral.  The hostess was gruff.  The other customers looked mad/sad.  Our waitress was nice enough, but the service was incredibly slow.  There were a lot of people working there, and not that many customers - so I couldn't quite understand the lack of attention.

I was really hoping that I would like this place.  I love southern cooking, and there's nothing better on a Friday or Saturday night than a rocking blues bar.  But this is not the place for that.  I'll just have to wait until I'm back down south - or perhaps head over to the MGM and eat at Emeril's.

Sorry, BB King.  Love your music, but your club is a no-go.Seems every year or so I have to go to Pizza hut just to remember how bad it really is. Honestly I don't know how that can call that baked stick of butter with cheese one it Pizza. While this location was at least clean and the staff was very friendly there is no getting past just how bad pizza hut pizza really is. The pizza at pizza hut taste like it is frozen and reheated. If you have to have it this location is great. If you have any taste in pizza you will just starve yourself and drive to chicago and get a real pie.Have to agree with Simian re: the fish fry.  Same experience pretty much.  (Service aside - that was good)  Fried cod way way way over cooked, salad bar . . . warm, watery, pretty gross.  Chili from a can perhaps?  Chicken noodle soup was pretty darn good tho.
Sometimes those dives have the best food  - we took our chances!  Sorry we didn't have a burger instead.This is a review of Pinnacle's downtown location, not Fitchburg. I unfortunately signed up for a $67/month one-club only plan and when they lowered their prices to $65/month for all-club access, told me the only way I could get the better deal was to add 12-more months to my current contract.

I don't think so, Pinnacle.

This overpriced, tiny club is clean and the staff is friendly.  Not surprisingly, the locker room is almost always empty and there is little or no waiting for equipment.  The cardio classes tend to be good, although most of  them are sparsely attended.  Given the lack of interest by members, the schedule is actually quite robust.

The only real reason to join this club is if, like me, you live downtown within walking distance. If you have a car and can drive, you have a much wider variety of better, less-expensive clubs available all over Madison.Sorry and I hate to give Sephora this rating but my experience today left a lot to be desired.

I went to Sephora in search of quite a few items. I'm starting a new job so I wanted to update my makeup stash. I've been existing off of drug store brands for awhile now but my new job requires me to be not just presentable, but polished. So. I wanted to completely revamp my makeup collection. The funny thing is I came here ready to lay down some serious cash but....

There were PLENTY of employees working here but not one of them greeted me. I walked the aisles, mostly looking at Smashbox and NARS. I wanted a kit and kaboodle type purchase. IE: Concealer, foundation, powder, and a finisher. Unfortunately no employee came around to help me. I even had one girl walk by me, say nothing, and then greet another customer.

At that point I decided to just go with what I had seen on YouTube videos. I tested concealers/foundations on the back of my hand until I found a match. Then I wandered to the Clinique section and selected a mascara. I also decides on a new eye-liner by Urban Decay based off of a "review of eyeliners" I pulled up while in the store.

I spent a good hour here without ANY help from an employee AND I left with $90 worth of makeup.

Honestly I could have done this kind of shopping online since I did it all myself anyway. Unfortunately there's no way to compare skin tone and foundation online.

So - my thanks for this makeup rejuvenation mostly goes to makeup artists of YouTube 90% and 10% goes to Sephora for being the place I could go make my purchases.Why did I think going here was a good idea?

For some reason, I thought that Mellow Mushroom was going to be some kind of pizza bistro, with emphasis on the 60's. Boy was I wrong. 

First off, this sports bar doesn't know what it is. Being a graphic designer, I know about the funky concept of branding, which this upscale TGI-Fridays completely tosses out the window. From the 60's font on the outside of the building, to the Modern skyline artwork on the walls, to the 10 different genres of t-shirts the servers wear, this place is chaotic and terrifying. 

And the food experience was even worse. 

First off, we got the Artichoke dip, which was ok. It was hot, which was nice, but I prefer a nice crust on the top of mine, which didn't happen. 

Then came the 45 minute wait for our pizza, which was then delivered to another table. 15 minutes after that, our server realized what happened, and to be fair, she was very apologetic, and it wasn't her fault, it was the fault of the runners. So, they made up another pie, and a manager gave us a comp meal and 2 free pizzas, which is nice and earns them a star. 

As for the pizza, we got the buffalo chicken pizza, which really needed more chicken and hot sauce. Most of what I had was a cheese & ranch pizza. The chicken was tasty, though very sparse, and the hot sauce was tangy, which is what I expect. I only wish there was more. 

The dough was very good though, and the pizza tasted decently cold the next morning. Slight hints of sweetness come through the crust, which was nice.

However, the disaster that occurred there, along with the schizophrenic atmosphere has chased me away for good. I will be using those coupons though when the time arises.

Lastly, looking around at other tables, I do not recommend the Pretzels. I see that there is an image of them on here, DO NOT BE FOOLED. I see NO reason to have to wait 20 minutes for Pretzels that are not even the size of a hand.The Gold Lounge is adjacent to the Viva Elvis theater (http://www.yelp.com/biz/cirque-du-soleil---viva-elvis-las-vegas#hrid:4AnaBZgo6J3ichCpap8UJQ).

Be sure to pick up your Viva Elvis tickets from will call a little while before your show time.  You should receive BOGO drink coupons to the Gold Lounge with your tickets.  However, don't get too excited about the five Elvis-inspired signature drinks they advertise on the sign outside the lounge.  Although it says NOTHING about any type of exclusions on the coupon, these specialty cocktails are not included in the offer.

After getting flustered and disappointed because I couldn't order a "Graceland" or whatever, we settled for a few beers that I could technically order anywhere else.  The server returned to our table first with our bill, followed by her "busser".  Hmm, apparently a few bottles of beer needed to be brought out on a platter with a fancy cloth by two people.  And guess what?  That means the bill had two lines for gratuity (one for the server, one for the busser).  Wowzers.  I realize this is a fancy-schmancy lounge, but jeez.  I think one person could have accomplished the job and been tipped appropriately.

The bottles of beer were $9 each (+ tax).  That's right, tax.  Anyway, not bad at BOGO, but questionable without the coupon.

The one cool thing about this place is you're allowed/encouraged to grab your cocktails here and take them into the show.  You may be asked to pour your drink into a plastic cup if you have glass though, which is also kind of lame.DJ is decent and I was able to find seating without having to pay for a table.  I like the decor but it really isnt decked out elvis and they domt have many restrooms.  What i hated was they have no regular water they "only sell water".......lame.....if you are serving large amounts of alcohol to people you should provide them with at least tap water if they ask.We have been customers with these guys since early 2010. We never really had trouble with them until recently. They either don't drop off enough water or any water at all! This past week we left our water out like they asked us to and we didn't get out refilled. We didn't think too much of and thought they would come the next day...nope still no water the next day. We called the company and asked them where our water was and they assured us they would leave it the next day(which was today and they had until 5:00 p.m to do it according to woman we spoke to) so 5:00 rolled around and what do you know..no water whatsoever. So now we are done with this company. We are going to give them everything we have from them and hopefully they wont give us any trouble like they have with other people that have posted.This was sad sad place. Even being the weekend the place didn't have many patrons. Maybe it was one of those off weekends but since were told that we are on the guest list and thus won't have to pay any cover so we said why not. Went in and saw some go go dancers but that just about it. We had a beer and after  that bolted out of there in less than 30 minutes.Whomp, whomp!

Having been to other Vegas clubs and clubs in LA, this club was boring. 
Yes, they have a dance floor, tables, an outdoor patio, but why would I ever wait to get in here when I can go to a better club in Vegas. 

Not worth it!I love all the other Pita Jungles
 - sadly this location has been constantly poor! 

The food here is 'hit or miss' and the service is terrible! 

Eg.
My waitress actually rolled her eyes at me today and was pretty rude in general - 
yet still managed to get my order wrong!!!!

I do not recommend this location!D'abord, précisons que la plupart des chambres de cet hotel, qu'il ne faut pas confondre avec le Planet Hollywood Casino voisin,  n'ont pas de vue sur le strip.

Les choses avaient plutot bien commencé : nous avons été upgradé dans une suite de luxe, soit 140m2 avec deux chambres dont une suite parentale avec jacuzzi, un salon avec video projecteur, une cuisine.

Malheureusement, la chambre s'est avérée sale : nous avons trouve des serviettes usagées, des medicaments entamés, une enveloppe de préservatif.

Plus tard, l'alarme incendie s'est déclenchée de façon intempestive dans notre chambre a 2h30 du matin; aucune excuse le lendemain de la direction de l'hotel.

Le service de bagage a été indigent; globalement, le service est totalement indigne d'un 5 etoilesI hate writing bad reviews, but this has been the second time I have left less than satisfied...

First time: I repeated myself numerous times letting them know I was HIGHLY allergic to any dairy and couldnt have the cheese or cream on the dish... she acknowledged and when I picked up my order, I double checked with the people making the food and they also confirmed there was no dairy.  So much to my suprise, I get back to my office and the bowl up to find cream sauce under the avocados.  :-(  I called in, and they did offer to replace my bowl, but my work is quite far and I was already back at work unable to leave again for a "second lunch" since I was the only one in the office.  Which meant no lunch for me that day...

So I thought I would give them another try... this time I got food for myself and someone else at the office.  Everyone was very nice, just as before, but I had to wait a while for my partners food since they had run out of chicken... okay, no big deal.  Well I get back to the office and my food was cold- they clearly had just let mine sit there the entire time as opposed to making his and mine at the same time.  Sad day Rubios, but I will not be back.

On the bright side- my coworker loved his meal!This is by far the grocery store I try to never go to. However, since its down the street, its an easy place to get a missing ingredient in a pinch.

The store itself is very worn down and just has a feeling of dirty. It's in desperate need of a remodel.

I've seen bugs, yes bugs, in the onion barrel a few times, which made me vow to never by produce here. Huge gross factor.

Also, huge creep factor, don't go here after sundown! This is when all the tweaked out folks come out from their hidey holes and bum money from people. It's really quite scary.

The only reason I have two stars is because of the convenience when absolutely needed and the Starbucks. Yea, thats about it.I work at starbucks so you can imagine my disappointment when my drink was made wrong. Please pay more attention to what your customers say. That and smile. Y'all look like you hate your jobs.Had an issue with a return, was told by the associate that if I got store credit, and then still did not find anything I wanted, that she would refund the store credit on to my debit card, there was no new shipment so when I spoke with the store manager Haley over the phone about the return I was promised, she kept trying to tell me it "wasn't a possibility" after beginning to explain the situation a second time she says "yes yes I know you explained several several times" then she kept trying to insist I go to another location that was inconvienently located further away to handle the situation, probably because she didn't want to help me, then when I show up there for the refund she Dosent even do me the courtesy of helping me herself, she pawns me off on to another associate while she scowls and gives me dirty looks the entire time. The only reason I put two stars instead of one is because Lacey who helped me was very opposite of Haley. Kind, patient, and NO issue or question, just took care of the customer. In my opinion maybe they should make HER the store manager, and maybe this place would have less of an issue next time. Will be looking for a different source of sports wear.You pretty much know what you're getting when you eat at Chilis...but my problem was with the service.  I am not a needy patron, but our drinks were never refilled and our waitress was crazy rude! It took forever to get our food and even longer to get the check.  We said we'd never to back, and we haven't! Horrible service!Beef rumba salad is light, refreshing and somewhat healthy. Dressing optional as it's so tasty with salsa only. Oh! and don't forget to squeeze lime on it.
Flavors are great, serving size is a bit small for the price paid. Seems a small salad like this one shouldn't be close to $7.00, I'd think more around $5.00. 
Ambience is sort of beachy if you use your imagination.This review is a two with a burning desire for five...

I want this place to succeed like I want a million bucks. 

I have never operated a food-providing establishment but I suspect it's quite difficult. 

But I've consumed a lot of food and beverage. 

My recommendation to this sweet little Pomegranate Cafe is don't skimp on the ingredients. I haven't eaten there but I had a spicy chai. One of my favorite places in town is called Sens and they have a drink called the Hot and Dirty. This drink takes a sledge hammer and hits you in the chest. Then it spits on you and its friends are dragging him away because they hear cop sirens in the distance. I don't even know if I like the taste or not but the experience is so powerful it is literally "an experience" to drink it. 

The way you described your drink and the way it came to me was abortive. I mean that in a "trying to be helpful way." Sincerely. 

Punch me in the face with this supposed spicy cayenne. I know, you said it's a hint. But I'm a man. Subtly is dust in the wind. 

Be better. I'll be back. Please try this place. I want it to win. 

One final thing. Get new lids IMMEDIATELY. First sip soaked me and my freshly dry-cleaned shirt.Joe was great over the phone when making my appointment and even told me about the  Groupon. 

Elle was nice too even tho I can see the frustration (from being so busy) in her and I thought she would have had an attitude when I checked in but when she looked up and greeted me she put a smile on her face and continued to be kind and helpful. 

Our photographer was a preggo chick but I didn't get her name. She was very nice but very exhausted. Poor lady! 

The staff ran around like chickens with their heads cut off although all were very nice. I never saw a manager in sight. They really need a receptionist or extra help for the holidays. It's not like they can't afford it because their stupid packages cost about $200 and up with no coupons. So wtf?!?! 

So... my appt was set for 7:20 pm (you have to do a late appt when bringing a pet) and we arrived just on the dot at 7:20 pm. I checked in with Elle and told me that it would be a 30 to 45 min wait. We sat there and waited because we couldn't walk around the mall with my dog. Nothing like watching each group go in one by one and counting who was here before you hoping that it's your turn next. Finally, it's 9ish and we get called back. Our photographer was just exhausted and I could tell she was huffing and puffing, again, poor lady! Haha I tried to help carry the props her because she shouldn't be lifting a finger! I swear we only spent like 20 or maybe 30 min with her and 99% of the time her flash was working. It wasn't until the end when she decided to switch for a new camera. I felt she only snapped about 8 photos (I haven't counted my pictures but it's not many). I didn't want to ask for more cause I felt bad that she's tired and we're pooped from waiting. My hair was flat, my dog was bored, my husband was anxious and my baby was tired and cranky by that time. 

They were offering two free sheets to those who would come back the following day to view their photos. I took up on the offer because that's what worked out for me since I wanted to get the family home. So I came back Tuesday during my lunch hour and waited another 20 min to just view them. Then I was told to wait another 30 for printing. I said I'd come back for them after work. Pick up was a breeze. 

Finally put in my overly priced high resolution disc and the shit was BLANK! I brought it back the next day (it's now Wednesday!) AND I had to wait for a good 30 min to get my replacement. I didn't get to see the manager, no apologies and or compensation! 

Look. I didn't even want to go here to begin with, especially because it's too "posey" and (did I mention) how ridiculously the price is but it was a last minute thing. And I had the $18 coupon but had it not been for the Groupon. I didn't want to miss out on not being able to capture a family photo before my little gets too big. With that being said, I really just wanted it on a disc for my holiday cards BUT she only took 8 photos for my 80 dollar disc with only 2 good pictures! 

I'm highly annoyed with the entire process and somewhat cheated!

Don't waste your money and time! You'll just end up with old-school-posey with cranky kids and not so good looking pictures. Hire a pro photographer instead where you will have ample time, different scenery, editing incl. or what not and get more bang for your buck. 

Learned my lesson. No more studio photos. Going back to my photographer, Chelsea Nicole! Definitely check out her work.They did a fair job. Prices are set, but they got to me fast! I've had better experiences with pop-a-lock and AAA, but also worse experiences. 007 got me taken care of...Orange beef was very dry and wasn't fresh at all. Kids meal sweet and sour chicken was tasteless. Shrimp in lobster sauce was good though, but not enough to overcome the bad. They were also out of most Of the beer choices when we were there.This place is a joke. The dental industry needs some regulation because the prices here are 3 times more than other dentists in the area.  Called for a quote on a simple tooth extraction and they wanted almost $400 after fees and such nonsense.  The dentist may be good here, but the prices are outrageous.   GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.I love supporting local non-corporate establishments and when we found it on yelp with nothing but great reviews we figured it was worth a try.  Service was good but the product that we were served was low quality...We ordered 2 breakfast items and both were not up to standards, the side of shredded bag lettuce and some rotten tomatoes was my 1st inclination this was not going to be a spot worth returing to.  I also decided to try a crepe, they were out of the one i wanted so i decided to go with nuttella and banana...The banana was old and supper soft,,,who likes old bananas? And to top it off...literally the ice cream on top of the crepe tasted of freezer burn.  All this for $20 something buck... The fellow yelpers before me gave out undeserved stars and lead me wrong.  There are much better spots in old town...seek them outI've been to Todd English's restaurants in both Boston and Las Vegas and this place doesn't measure up at all.  The atmosphere was pretty cool but the food was very disappointing.  I had the Bison burger and I'd much rather have an In-N-Out burger.  The meat was bland and the bun wasn't fresh.  My wife had the lobster roll and it was very salty.  No need to dress up lobster if the quality is good.  I'd probably won't be going back.  Way too many better options in Vegas for a $30 per person lunch.I had chance to stop into this place tonight based on the fine reviews here on Yelp!

I afraid to say that I was underwhelmed after all the build up.  The burgers, while fresh were very basic.  I also didn't get the burger I requested.  It seems that the employees, which there quite a few were busy having fun and chatting about things for them to pay attention to what they were doing.  The fries were undercooked and somewhat burnt, which I'm not sure how they accomplished that.

I'll try again going inside one day when I'm in the area to see if this was just a fluke.
