I checked out the menu for a solid TEN MINUTES before a woman came out from the back.  She didn't say anything, just went to her register and stared at me.  Way to make a girl feel welcome.\n\nI ordered food to go-a veggie wrap and some spicy falafel sandwich with kale chips.  She retreats to the back of the store and I fought the temptation to eat all of the cupcakes in the platter on the counter to show my dissatisfaction.  But then I remembered that I am a \"grown-up\", so I decided to walk away.\n\nTwenty minutes later she hands me my food, no thank you or anything, but whatevs.  She tells me I can help myself to pickles and such on the bar.  When I open the falafel sandwich it is clear that it is the wrong thing.  When I ask her she just lies and says it is what I ordered.  I was too hungry and annoyed to argue so I said fine.  \n\nI walked over to the other food station because there was NO HUMMUS ON THE SANDWICH.  She said, oh we charge extra for hummus.  Lady, no one charges extra for hummus on a falafel.  My people didn't wander through the desert, schvitzing and kvetching so that they could pay extra for hummus.  Hummus and Falafel are like french fries and ketchup, like oreos and milk...they just go together.\n\nWith all that said, if you are hungry enough that you don't care and you have your own personal supply of hummus, go there between 11-2 for their lunch special.  You get fries, a drink and a falafel sandwich for 7 $.  Just don't expect any hummus... :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "l8uDeX2E58RBEc6FfQpdHw"}

I did enjoy the taftoon bread, it had a nice freshness to it and was different from the pita i'm used to. The meat was seasoned a little too well. Near the end of my meal i could hardly recall if there was any lamb in it seeing as the spices were so heavy it masked any individual taste of the meat itself. What little hummus and cucumber yogurt i had left were thrown on the wrap and it did improve the taste. Toward the end i reached for a bottle of franks red hot to liven things up a bit. \n\nAlso ordered a Lamb & Beef Gyro.\nI missed the lunch special by an hour so instead of 3.99 for gyro only i had to pay the standard price for the entire meal. Not really a problem.\n\nAli at Kebab Korner has spoiled me. Even when he tried to singe my taste buds by making his famous super gyro 'burn my ass' (his actual words to his staff \"one super gyro, super spicy! BURN HIS ASS!!') with it's level of spiciness it just made me want more.\n\nThis gyro is extremely mellow, the meat was a bit dry and inside covered with yogurt cucumber sauce.

We went for the first time a little over a year ago to try something new and swore we would become regulars, well for some reason that didn't happen, and we went again last night.\n\nAnyways, our first visit we had an older lady there helping us get our order (we were getting it to go). She knew about everything on the menu, was not only helpful, but very willing and happy to help. We could not remember exactly what we had ordered, so I won't comment on the specific dishes, except the fact that we loved all of what we had (otherwise, why in the world would we want to become regulars, right?!).....\n\nI lie. I remember one thing that we had, and it was their coffee. Delicious. It comes in a tall glass, with condensed milk at the bottom, and the coffee slowly dripping down on top of the condensed milk. Trust me, get the coffee!\n\nSo last night we decide we really wanted to go back here. We had a different server, and younger man. He was just as, if not more so, nice as the first lady that was there. He would explain the differences in the dishes, and when asked what he recommended, he didn't say \"everything\" (pet peeve of mine). I got the Che Kreung (sp?) and my wife got a dumpling soup. We also shared the Baiykung (sp again?) Crepes. They were delicious! Filled with ground pork, shrimp, and bean sprouts. Served with a side of lettuce, mint, cilantro, cucumber, and fish sauce. All eaten together is truly awesome. \n\nMy wife had Jasmine Iced Tea, and that was surprisingly really good. It comes unsweetened, and I don't think I would want to add sugar to it either.\n\nMy wife loved her dumpling soup. It has dumplings, and rice noodles. The broth alone was really flavorful without adding anything into it. If you like Vietnamese Pho, you can get this, or the Katheya (Cambodian version of Pho). The broth for Katheya is chicken and pork broth as opposed to beef broth. They also add fried garlic to it.\n\nMy Che Kreung which is a lemongrass stir fry was delicious. Came with pickled veggies (carrots, cauliflower, and cucumber), white jasmine rice, and beef which had onion and green beans mixed in. The lemongrass is definitely there flavor-wise. Everything was truly delicious, and again my wife and I left saying we will become regulars, but obviously, we are slackers :)\n\nEither way, my wife and I really love this little shin-dig. Great service, clean, decent prices, can't go wrong. We will definitely be back, if not as regulars!", "type": "review", "business_id": "nlFlIeziD-4nNUF2B337Yw"}

So, maybe the family style worked against this restaurant. Ok, let me start with the good: We got a noodle dish (I don't know which one...curses!), it had wide noodles and shrimp and beef...it was my fave, very tasty, the curry soup - super tasty, rich, the chicken in it was wonderful (this was what I was going to order), the grilled pork - simple, but delicious with a touch of sweetness (this is what the BF was gonna order), and the ginger beef (tasty....could have had more flavor, but if you add their hot sauce, it was really good). The not so good: The basil drink (I know people like it, I thought it had an odd flavor...not basil -y.....and it had weird jelly things in it and the texture was off putting), the bbq platter (we got two of these and they just weren't very good - they had sliced beef (which was cold and bland), chicken wings that had the entire wing (also not much flavor and difficult to eat), and a beef skewer, which was ok, but nothing special), all the fish dishes (the amok fish sounded amazing with a curry sauce, but I thought it was lacking flavor, the mango fish - just not a lot of mango flavor or maybe not enough for this non fishy fish eater, and the seafood plate which was just plain fish, shrimp, and squid....yikes), the springroll (was ok, nice and crispy, but the filling had an odd flavor).

It definitely took way too long. Finally after mentioning I wanted to try the place every time I drove past this place with my fella, he decided to surprise me with a visit here for Valentine's dinner last night. \n\nWe arrived around 8pm and were seated very quickly. Glad my fella made a reservation, as they had our table ready and waiting for us when we arrived at the busy restaurant. The server was quick to approach us for our drink orders and was extremely attentive and diligent throughout the meal. I have to give extra kudos for the impeccable service at Kyara. We were never left wanting for anything. Our drinks were always full, our stream of food arrived promptly and well spaced out and all the servers were incredibly friendly and helpful with recommendations.\n\nWe ordered a large variety of options to get a sampling of as many things as we could. My favorites for the evening were the jalapeno salmon, garlic potatoes (despite burning the entire inside of my mouth), bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms, tempura cheese with fig jam and the yuzu dessert, which was amazing. Everything else was pretty good as well, but it's hard not to compare the place to my other two favorite izakaya restaurants in town Raku and Ichiza. I loved a lot of the dishes, but the skewers and other cooked food didn't blow me away as much as Raku or Ichiza, unfortunately. Don't get me wrong, the food was definitely solid and I will definitely be back to try a smattering of other options. I just wish the char on many of the grilled and skewered meats was a little more present. The sasami with wasabi was overly dry and flavorless, so I don't think I'd order that again.  The fish, starch and dessert selections were amazing though. Very tasty indeed.\n\nThe fantastic service was topped off by the presentation of chocolates and a pink rose to commemorate the Valentine's holiday. Very nice touch.\n\nI have heard very good things about their lunch offerings and look forward to hopefully trying the place out for lunch some time soon. Definitely a great option in my neighborhood. So glad they have a place close to home to satiate my cravings. I'll be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "h83afVKqwBlA-zOu_vdtEw"}

Awesome.\n\nI am glad BeeGee opened up in my neighborhood because mainly I was tired of the lack of healthy affordable options around the Spring Valley area. \n\nWhat I enjoy most about the yakitori (skewers) at BeeGee is that the meat is actually decent quality and lots of TLC was put into making each skewer. They're closed on Monday, but must be because they're preparing for the week. I know because I tried to go on a Monday, but the door was locked and they were busy prepping. The great variety of different skewers such as chicken breast, gizzard, heart, squid, scallop, and beef for example combined with the smokey flavor from their unique (charcoal!) grill that is supposedly hand crafted from Japan makes BeeGee a winner. \n\nBest deal has to be the 6 pick your own sampler. Reason is that you can have anything! Some skewers like the scallops cost $2 something already. Plus you get a discount on their many drinks. The adjusted price is $2.25 from $2.85 I believe. The drinks now come in the trendy JUMBO cups that don't really fit in your cup holder lol. My favorite would have to be the honey green tea citrus and the mango yoyo. Yoyo drinks are yogurt based, kind of taste like Yakult (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakult). Don't worry my non-meat eating friends they also have veggie options for your tasting.\n\nAside from the yakitori, they also offer udon, sukiyaki, sizzling plates, and... dun dun dun.. teriyaki bowls. Their teriyaki bowl comes in a good meat to vegetable to rice ratio that would make an excellent substitute for that weak salad you could eat at Quizno's. Lastly, its quality over quantity over here, so if you're a big eater that is starving, I wouldn't suggest it if you're on a budget.  \n\n\nNote: Wait time is longer than most traditional restaurants, mostly because it takes lots of love to make the skewers nicely cooked :). So if its for lunch that you're picking up.. call ahead!", "type": "review", "business_id": "IUmAp5W5MaCvQ7I0NpF_fQ"}

However, the burgers were also a very appealing option so I went with that instead. My friend and I were also feeling ambitious, so we got a side of nachos.\n\nFirst off, the serving of nachos was very generous, which was nice, considering it cost more than my burger. The tray on which they're served has a large diameter, so the toppings were evenly distributed amongst all the nachos (ie. no sad bland chips on the bottom). The chips were the baked ones, and were fairly bland, so it wasn't too salty with the cheese.\n\nI had pretty high expectations for the burger, because there was a substantial blurb on the menu about how the meat was from Beretta Farms. The burger wasn't a total disappointment, but the patty was under-seasoned and did the meat no justice. Nonetheless, it was certainly among some of the better burgers I've had. The \"side\" of fries was also massive.

Systems, in theory, have been created but something is always bound to fail. The only way to maintain structure is to adapt without freaking out. The staff at Stand Up Live did just that. They did a fantastic job on keeping things organized without having a lot of guidance. \n\nThere was a line to get in for the late show so I was thankful we planned to arrive relatively early. The procedure for seating was perfect. They had approximately 20 hosts/hostesses on a rotation basis to seat each group. The seating was great with lines of tables facing the stage so no one in the house had their back to the stage. The server greeted us immediately and was knowledgeable and friendly. We did not eat but drinks we great. From the looks of the food, we regret choosing to eat at another restaurant prior to the event.\n\nThe comedians were hilarious. Because it is a relatively small venue, everyone in the house was very close to the stage. It created a very imtimate feeling with the performer. When they interacted with the crowd, you could actually see who they were talking to/about. \n\nThe only downfall was at the end. Because there is a two drink minimum, the servers cashed everyone out at the end of the show... at the same time. So running all the cards and bringing back receipts took at least 10 minutes. This is the part where I feel the kinks will be worked out. In theory, it's a great idea but when you don't have enough registers to ring out everyone at the same time, it takes a little while. I have no doubt this will be fixed the next time we go.\n\nHelp support this local business. Go to Stand Up Live for your next comedy show!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ppdupQ9MnvVtDTWWW59NKg"}

I can say, I felt pretty confused during most of my experience at Stand up Live. A few friends and I ate dinner downtown, and then walked over to the comedy theatre around 8:45pm. The show wasn't scheduled to start until almost 10pm, and the line outside of the comedy theatre was astronomical. I gotta say, waiting in line that long outside, people definitely got frustrated as to why they couldn't go in and sit down in the theatre, order drinks etc. Again, I am a comedy novice, so maybe this is how all comedy theatres work? \n\nAnyhow, we get inside and sit down, and I order a pomatini and the spinach artichoke dip. Both were phenomenal! The drink was well balanced, and the dip was so good that I wanted to bathe in it. Word of caution: do not expect your service to be lickety split. The theatre seats a lot of people, and you could tell the servers were hustling to get things done. It still took a good 20 minutes to get food/drinks out to the tables. I've read some reviews already that suggest the food/drink is pricey, but truth be told I didn't feel the prices were off-point at all. My pomatini and spinach artichoke dip, with an automatic 15% tip came to about $21 which is right where it should be...about $9 for the drink and about $9 for the dip. The tip was added automatically even though I was just paying for me...but maybe because I was part of a larger party they added it...*shrug* another point of confusion. I felt that my server should have said something before running my card and adding in the 15% without me knowing. I wasn't mad about it, but I could see that being a problem for other folks. Either way, I could tell the server was working pretty hard to keep up with everything so I didn't mind leaving him 15% and actually I gave him a few extra bucks for good measure. \n\nThe theatre itself was very comfortable to me, with the decor being seemingly unremarkable. The audience should be focusing on the comic after all.  The booths we were at had tables that were not move-able, so our friend that is pregnant definitely had difficulty getting in and out of the table with her belly. I cannot even imagine someone that's heavier set sitting at one of those booths, so I recommend a table versus a booth if you qualify under that description. \n\nOverall, it seems that there are some aspects of the venue that will get ironed out in time, as they have only been open for about a month. Ill be giving it another whirl here in a bit and see if things have changed at all.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ppdupQ9MnvVtDTWWW59NKg"}

The facility however could use some tweeking.  The entry way and exit area are a bit disorganized, difficult to get in and out of during the seating time between shows.  Inside, there really isn't a bad seat in the house due to the way the seats are staggared.  I would be happier if the menu were a little more sophisticated, standard wings and burger type fare.  Tickets are typically $25.00 a person which I think is really fair.  What isn't fair, is the two drink minimum.  Beers are 5-6 dollars, sodas are 4 and mixed drinks about 10-12 dollars.  Typicallly prices, but I'm not a fan of being told I have to order without a choice.  The servers scramble to get you drink orders and they do a pretty good job without interrupting the flow of the comedians.  I'm sure I'll be back before long.  I'm really hoping that this venue helps push downtown into the busy center is has the potential to be.

There was only one misstep, and unfortunately for our server, it was one that made for a difficult evening for him for the rest of the night.\n\nWe were a party of 7, and it all started very well with seating us, and taking our drink orders immediately. The misstep? He came back to take our dinner orders before the drinks arrived. Sounds like a small thing, right? Normally it is - although I will say that, in my opinion, that should not happen. Because now you've created a feeling that either a) you're being rushed; or b) the drinks were taking a very long time to be delivered. Unfortunately, this did not sit well with dad. And from that point on he was obsessed by it. He really, really, really wanted his drink. (An aside: he was under an amazing amount of stress, the family had all flown in to be with him, and he really needed a drink....'nuf said). His release was to make a stinkin' big deal about this all night. I believe the server handled the situation as well as he could - but he really never tapped into making sure his drinks overlapped....and there was much conversation about it. The server did well with all the food orders, and checking in with us as often as possible. Okay - I'm done with that portion of the evening.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious - by ALL accounts. I would ask that they warn people about the appetizer portions....I'm from California, so when I order a spicy mussels starter, I expect maybe 6 mussels in a small bowl. No - this thing was HUGE. Fortunately I sat next to daughter who ate about 20 mussels, leaving me 6. I also had the mushroom risotto, and it was delicious. Even grumpy dad, who started with the caprese, had the veal picatta, and ended with the Tiramisu and a glass of port, readily agreed that the food was excellent.\n\nThe atmosphere is just right - casual enough to not be stuffy, but modern enough to be kinda hip. It's a very good find and next time we're in town, we will be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2P_hn2-tMwx4ea7kljn8nQ"}

The over all tast was good and comes with rice.\n\nBut the Pad Thai, I think they need to go back to the drawing board.  Very bland and didn't really activate the palette at all.  Almost like they only used half the seasonings.  It did have mushrooms, green beans, carrots, cabbage, and maybe some bean sprouts on the plus side.  Portion size was large, but really need to double down on the seasoning and spices for that large of a portion.\n\nThe service was very friendly and accommodating while the decor was inviting.

Tex mex is so popular, and luckily for us Tacos El Gordo serves up truly legit Mexican.  Outdoor and indoor seating is available, but when you are from Canada and you have the opportunity to dine outdoors in March, you take it.  The ordering process is slightly confusing.  Upon walking in to the restaurants, there is a cashier, and you would think that you pay first and then order, wrong.  Instead you go in the designated line, for steak, pork, etc, order, and then you pay.  It is amazing to watch the food be completely prepared for you form scratch in minutes.  On your way to pay, their is an additional toppings bar that was stocked with limes, radish, etc.  We ordered 6 tacos and paid $12 for two people, where most of the fancy restaurants on the strip that is the price one cocktail.  I am a self admitted taco snob, just because i have had so many legit tacos.  These tacos rate up their with some of the best.  They come on corn or flour, but for me their is only one option, corn is a must.  For the carne asada, the meat was tender, and they chop and cook it on the flat top seconds before putting it on a tortilla with onions, herbs, and guacamole.  It had so much flavour without being too hot, it was extremely fresh, my one complaint was that there was too much guacamole.  The pork taco again had so much flavour  from the cilantro, it tasted so bright, and with a squeeze of lime i was totally satisfied.  Both tacos had a good base of extremely flavourful meat, they didnt need to be topped with a million ingredients to make them taste great, they were simple, authentic, and boasting with flavour.\n\nOverall i loved Tacos El Gordo, they make a lot of las vegas residents and tourists happy with an amazing product that they dish out hundreds of times daily.  My only complaint was the whole ordering process, the cashier was helpful, but i am sure she tires of telling people where to line up.  One suggestion would be more signage.

Found this place mentioned as a top choice on several websites, especially when researching the best cheap eats in Vegas.  Granted, they are not necessarily cheap for street tacos ($2 to $3), but compared to prices in Vegas as a whole, Tacos el Gordo is a bargain!  During a lunch break during a business conference at the LV Convention Center, my friend and I came here.  Expecting huge lines, we prepared for a long wait, but it turned out that lunch time is a pretty good time to visit.  According to my friend, the lines are absolutely huge during the late night hours, after the clubs get out.  Anyway, I ordered two of their famous spicy pork tacos, one beef shoulder taco, and, because I wanted to be adventurous, one beef brain taco.  I had each one \"with everything\" and all of them were delicious!  Without a doubt, the two pork tacos were the absolute best...sweet, savory, spicy...full of flavor!  The beef shoulder was excellent to, a bit stringy, but overall very tasty.  The brain taco was...interesting.  With all of the accompanying toppings, it was very tasty, but it was the texture that was the most different.  Creamy is probably the best word to describe it.  Would I order one again?  Probably not, but I am very glad that I tried it.  Was it filling?  After eating my four tacos, I felt thoroughly satisfied.  I was by no means full, but happily fed (for about $10 mind you) and looking forward to a future visit.  \n\nWhen in Vegas, I will visit again and now that I know that they are also in my home town, I will be making a drive down there soon as well!", "type": "review", "business_id": "IRYj1b1-mlXqABVsl9SoqQ"}

We were hungry and it was my wife's 50th birthday. We asked a worker on the floor to recommend a place to eat and told us all the restaurants in the hotel were excellent, give that woman a raise! Great answer! We asked about the Oyster Bar over at Anthony's Prime Steak and Seafood. She told us she is a huge fan of the pan roast and that's what we were looking for! so we head over there and it was not busy but it was not empty either.  We sat at the Oyster Bar area and the aromas there was just inviting. I have to agree 100% with the last reviewer \"Amazing food, ambiance, and service.\" It sure was indeed. We both had the Shrimp pan roast and one thing is for sure, they did their homework and went to the Palace Station oyster bar to see what made them so uniquely amazing and how was Anthony's version be a little bit better, the answer! More flavor and bigger SHRIMP!!!! OH HELL YEAH BABY! THAT'S THE TICKET! We were just blown away by the dish I enjoyed with a glass of pinot noir.  The chief's that evening were awesome too, even let us have a sample of their soups, we are coming back! \nOnce are meals were done, we were ask if we wanted deserts, I mentioned it was my wife's birthday... Although it was the 4th we were a day late to celebrate because of things needed  to be taken care of the day before. As soon as I mentioned Birthday our awesome waiter just stopped me and said he'd be right back. Few minutes later he came back with a chocolate moose that was out of this world and made our evening that much extra special! \n\nIf you never been to the M but you've seen drive into Vegas from the I15, do yourself and favor and check it out!\n\nI'm not a food critique, just a fan of good food that likes to write about my experience, So go out and experience food and be the judge.", "type": "review", "business_id": "o4zI9D9QiKTdRpeN0EQGYA"}

Until last night I honestly believed my father and I made the worlds best two steaks Anthony's is now on my list as number one. it was lightly seasoned, perfectly marinated and ooh so incredibly melt in your mouth tender/juicy. I almost wish I had ordered a 2nd one to take home with us. \n\nThe GF loved her Prime Rib and devoured almost every last bit of it, not something she normally does. We shared a salad and a side order of the mashed potatoes.  The summer herb vinaigrette for the salad was amazing! We were dipping almost everything we had on the table in it and may have just guzzled it down had they left a bottle of it on the table. \n\nThe potatoes were a little bland but were a creamy smooth delight if you put them on your plate and used them to soak up some of the steak juice.  Another disappointing part of the evening was with our Raw Oyster appetizer. We ordered the half dozen and were served 6 Oysters that if combined may have actually made up two or three adult sized Oysters for the price we paid for them we should have been given oysters the size of my fist but they were the only disappointment of the night.\n\nSorry but thats not true, I was disappointed with the beer selection, no draft beers and nothing you couldn't find down at the local store. Also, You go to a steak house to eat a great steak and have a great dining experience with friends and family but they were teasing me with the MLB playoffs being on a TV in the next section and the TVs were too far away for me to catch the score over the GFs shoulder. \n\nOur server was great, perfect timing, knew the menu and could answer questions about what was in the dishes and would pair well with the other items on the menu. I wish I had thought to ask him to give me the playoff score updates as I was sitting there.

Since he favors himself a \"pizza connoisseur,\" my fianc\u00e9 has dragged me to every pizza joint in the city.  Therefore, when he proclaims that something is worthy of five stars, I listen.  In this case, I also completely agree.  I'll freely admit that I was pretty ho-hum when he told me he had a \"bitchin' new pizza place\" for us to try tonight, as that usually means that I'm going to be subjected to some cold, limp, mall-quality pizza in the back of some building in an abandoned alley.  The boy lacks discretion sometimes - he'd eat a flat tire if someone put pizza sauce on it.  However, my hasty judgment (in this case anyway) was a bit premature. \n\nRusso's is cute, complete with checkered vinyl tablecloths and a TV at every table.  Yep, I said it.  A separate TV at every table.  If you ask, they'll give you the remote so you can change the channels yourself.  Awesome.  We were greeted quickly by a friendly young waitress who remained attentive and helpful throughout the meal.\n\nWe ordered a pizza with sausage, pepperoni, jalape\u00f1o, olive, and tomatoes.  I had a side salad with ranch as well.  The side salad was crisp and cool with thin (yet creamy) ranch.  It was a decent size for the $3 (or so) I paid.  When the pizza came out, I thought we could finish the whole thing in one sitting.  I mean, it was plenty big (we got the largest size), but I know my fianc\u00e9's capacity to wolf down pizza is almost unmatched.  Boy, was I wrong.\n\nThe crust has a light, crispy texture that stands up well to the weight of the toppings.  Although it gives the appearance that one could eat massive quantities, it's actually very filling.  The toppings were very generous as well.  The real highlight was the sliced (not crumbled) sausage.  The taste was reminiscent of Secret Pizza in the Cosmopolitan, one of my favorite pizza places in town.  However, it was refreshing finding the same high-quality pizza without having to deal with the hustle and bustle of the Strip.\n\nI was full after a single slice, so that left a good portion of the pie to bring home (even after my fianc\u00e9 decided to unbutton his pants to make room for more... that's his sign that a pizza is good!).  It's sitting in our fridge right now, just begging to become a midnight snack.  For the price we paid I feel we got a good value, especially when you factor in the leftovers.  I really don't know why one would feel it necessary to go to Pizza Hut or Domino's when there are high-quality, affordable, family-owned pizza places like this in the Valley.  Good job, Russo's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bY3DZERDCvEb066dUocfdA"}

For an appetizer we ordered the rock shrimp with garlic, basil aolioli (sp) dipping sauce. The shrimp were okay, but needed a more flavorful dipping sauce maybe a spicy marinara or barbecue. For my meal I decided to go with the soup and 9 inch pizza lunch special: butternut squash & margerita pizza. The soup was actually quite good. The pizza was good, but something was missing. Oh yeah, the CHEESE!!! Seriously, do I have to ask for extra cheese on a pizza? I really look forward to my cheat day and the pizza did not live up to my expectations.\n\nFor dessert I went with the donut holes drizzled with caramel and sprinkled with powdered sugar. The order is huge, seriously there were no less than 30 donut holes. Cheat day or not it was just too much. My husband ordered 2 scoops of vanilla ice-cream.

I got a hassle and attitude when I called them about it, so this morning I roll through the drive-thru and tell the lady what happened. She agrees to comp my oatmeal and I add a piece of pumpkin bread to my typical drink order. I pull forward and pay...I had to reload my Starbucks card too so during all this I get my oatmeal and my bread. Then I get my card back and the Southern Belle lady (if you go here you'll know) working the window is like have a nice day. I sit there and she looks back out and is like, What? Why are you still here? I'm like aren't you forgetting something? She looks around and says Oh Crap! when she realizes she never gave me my drink!\n\nSo when I write on here that anyone who visits this Starbucks needs to doublecheck their order to make sure you get what you paid for, will you believe me now?\n\n1 Star? Really? Absolutely. Can you think of a reason why I should bump them up? Oh and it took 7 minutes to get that container of oatmeal, a piece of pumpkin bread, and an iced mocha, no whip, extra shot. The location at Eastern and Desert Inn can do it in 4 minutes, with 3 cars in front of me when I order to boot.\n\nOne last thing. Still no fruit toppings for the oatmeal. I guess re-supplying the store is not all that important here. \n\n(For the backstory on this read yesterday's review below)", "type": "review", "business_id": "T1VQy4L2ctvSHlMYVpzClg"}

What I love most about Buldogi's is that they have these awesome, uniquely inspired toppings on a quality hot dog and they don't skimp on those toppings. Kimchi? Check. Sriracha mayo. Check. Roasted garlic mustard. Check, check. Banh mi slaw? I DIE. The possibilities are endless! \n\nWhile I'm not quite a fan of some of their fusion dogs because all of that meat is even too much for me I can totally appreciate how creative and abundant the toppings are. My favorite is the classic chili dog-yes, chili is full of meat, but there's something less daunting about it than strips of straight up beef or pork belly. The chili here is probably better than most chilis you've ever had-and to think they make it just to top hot dogs and french fries with-that's some dedication right there. \n\nWhat I am a fan of is the plain old dog. Could I eat it plain? Yup. Do I ever? Nope. There's too much to try at Buldogi's and while one of their dogs could stand alone, I love to experiment and the range of toppings they have are as generous as they are unique. These dogs are so good that I'm tempted to try their very unorthodox turkey dog. I know, I shook my head myself too. But that's how good their hot dogs are-good enough to make you think they could make a turkey dog that will change your view on turkey dogs! They also offer tofu dogs....but I'm not gonna go there.\n\nThe service is friendly and helpful and you can call orders in ahead of time, so you don't have to wait (some orders, like the Euro fries, can take a bit). The space is small but very clean and if you do have to wait there's a TV and a very colorful and information-packed chalkboard with the day's specials and all kinds of fun drawings that will keep you just as entertained as watching the TV.\n\nI guess one could make the argument that 4.95 is pricey for a hot dog. However when you look at the major factors of quality and quantity, you could easily say that you're getting your money's worth and then some. Like I said, the hot dogs aren't your standard franks-Buldogi's is giving the people what they want and it's 100% beef!\n\nBuldogi's has been added to two very exclusive lists of mine called \"places I'll drive across town lunch for\" and \"foods I will eat while driving at the risk of others and my outfit.\"", "type": "review", "business_id": "ADTZPVMIYJN0jAvvHxcBMw"}

All that comes to mind when I eat at Buldogis is \"DAYUM DAYUM DAYYYYYYYYUM!!!\" Youtube Five Guys Burger Review if you don't get the reference. \n\nTo give you an idea of how AWESOME this place is: I, a cheap Asian male, tipped this place roughly 23% for the experience I had. My last visit, I came with my girlfriend's family for lunch. We ordered Angry Dogs and the Bulgogi Dog (not sure if that's what it's called, but that's basically what it is) with Euro Fries and Angry Fries to share. Mere words can not describe the delicious taste of the dogs and Angry Fries. The Euro Fries came pretty salty, but that's just something I'll avoid next time. \n\nThe magic here though, is the service. Every time I come in, I'm always served by the Head Chef. To anyone who doesn't actually know where the management lies, would easily be deceived into believing that Head Chef Cesar is the owner because of the amount of care he puts into the customers. During my visit, the chef messed up my order and served us an order of sweet potato fries that we did not order. We kindly told him that we did not order a side of sweet potato Angry fries, but he gave it to us anyways! Our party and another table were always checked on during our meal.\n\nI just can not express my love for Buldogis.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ADTZPVMIYJN0jAvvHxcBMw"}

It's creamier than most and more yogurt like. It has a good smoky flavor though and good little bites of eggplant. \n\nHummus, salad, falafel, drink combo ($9.95)- The hummus is good here; it's a smooth and creamy consistency with good flavor. The salad it comes with is cucumber,tomato, onion salad simply dressed with lemon and olive oil. They give you small falafel that is light and crunchy.  I prefer a softer, denser lightly crunchy ball. \n\nThe pita accompany it is fluffy and great. They offer a \"free salad bar\" and it's not what I think when I hear that word. It's more accompaniments than dinner salad. It was more like pickled carrots, pickled spicy cauliflower, red cabbage slaw, radishes, hot sauce, stewed tomatoes making up the spread. Everything was fresh, homemade tasting and went well with the baba and hummus. \n\nThe portions were generous since we took home enough for a snack later.\n\nThere are trays of sweets so we were curious to try some. I ended up getting a orange blossom water infused baklava square and the BF got one that was plain with a cherry on top. The chef (presumably owner) gave us a bag of little crunchy balls covered in the same type of syrup as the baklava. Everything was pretty good, but small. It was $1.99 for a two bite piece so while the meal is a deal of a price the desserts aren't.\n\nIt's a basic little place and the staff was pretty nice.

I was just driving through from LA to the northern US, and am really glad I found this place and didn't have to go to yet another fast food stop or Starbucks. I even have Italian Delights bookmarked as my stop for food now for all future trips. \n\nThe owner greeted the three of us and was very friendly- always coming back to check how we were doing, how we liked the food, and just chat. The place has a very casual atmosphere, but it's also very welcoming. \n\nThe portions for the food were enormous, especially for the great price. Obviously this isn't Michelin Star dining, but look around you- you're in the outskirts of Vegas. And that city has some really bad food for through the roof prices AND snobby service. Italian Delights is a refreshing change, and their Calzone, Chicken Alfredo, and Caprese Salad were all wonderful.

It's fun to get up, walk around and take a look at what everyone is doing about 3/4 of the way through. There's so much room for interpretation and the drastic differences and even sometimes subtle ones are very telling. We left inspired (and buzzed) and headed out for a nice afternoon of lunching.

Oh and their complimentary Miso soup is one of the best I have ever had. \n\nI believe this is a small family owned and operated business, and with today's economy I have to give them props for opening up.

I'm not disillusioned or unrealistic. Hairballs, food wolfed down too fast, bits of string or packing material that somehow looked appetizing. I'd nearly eliminated the hairball situation with these little nuggets I got on Amazon, but one of the cats kept puking just bile. Like, every other day. Often on the bed. He was otherwise fine, acting cute and stupid as normal, no weight loss. The vet said something about a protein sensitivity (?) and to try switching to one of those single ingredient foods. Oh, and it might take up to 6 weeks to see a change. If he's still having trouble, we sell this [exorbitantly expensive] partially pre-digested food. I dropped a chunk of change on fancy Blue Buffalo food from PetSmart and yet the vomiting continued. \n\nThen one day, after a mani/pedi, my friend wanted to pop into this pet store to see if they carried her dog's food. For shits and giggles, I asked the guy working there about my situation. He said the cat was having trouble digesting the food and so adding digestive enzymes should make that easier and eliminate the puking. Given that the vet had suggested that pre-digested food (um, yuck), this made sense. Then the guy went on to say that pumpkin contains the enzymes in question. Just mix a little in their food, and you'll see a change in 3 days if that's the problem. I probably laughed at him, but bought a $3 can of their fancy organic pumpkin puree either way as well as a handful of cat toys from the bins. He threw in a ton of samples of single ingredient foods, which I thought was nice. \n\nTwo weeks later? The only puke around these parts is string or tinsel from one of the glittery toys I bought that day (ah, irony). Unbelievable! I went back and to Pet Planet and got all the food he recommended, as well as powdered digestive enzymes.

For those of you yelpers familiar with LA it is a little bit like a Mini Grove in Las Vegas with easier parking and hotter/colder temps outside (depending on what time of year you come).  \n\nOverall:  Good food + good service = A happy  happy  hour goer", "type": "review", "business_id": "5CGT-eGqL2zECmQpM9wPbw"}

It's spacious and and comfortable.  While I've only been for lunch, I will definitely return for dinner, and I hear they may be serving breakfast at this location too which I'd be down to try also.\n\nWhile I'm not a fan of being forced to valet, at least it's free (although you've gotta factor in a tip). All of the staff from the valet to the hostess and waiters were exceptionally friendly, and as mentioned in other reviews, their \"uniforms\" are extremely cool.  \n\nBut even more important is the food... and this menu is different than the others (although they do have some of my favorite old standbys like zucca chips and the insalate casa aka Caesar salad).  Some new favorites from my recent lunch are the salumeria panini (soppressata, salami, mortadella, roasted peppers, provolone) and the verdure pizze (brussel sprouts, butternut squash, caramelized onion, spiced hazelnuts, ricotta salata).  And if you're looking for a little snack or starter, I'm a huge fan of the crispy chickpeas.  \n\nSince this new location is conveniently located super close to my home, I can't wait to return to try some of their other menu items and some wine, beer, or cocktails from their very well stocked bar.

One, the lot is tiny compared to the number of people the place can hold, and parking is very tight.

I had to be appear at 8:45am, but I wanted to get there earlier just in case I couldn't find my way. \n\nFirst you gotta park further away. People say to park by the Golden Nugget since they validate parking. The Golden Nugget is 5 blocks away and I am not walking 5 blocks in heels. So, I just parked at the Bank of America parking structure which was less than a block away. It's $3 for every 30 minutes, which is really pricey. I didn't mind though because I knew I was going to be reimbursed at work. Don't forget you are Downtown, not the safest neighborhood, so just be cautious when you are walking alone. \n\nWhen you get into the courthouse, you have to empty your pockets and take your shoes off and walk through the metal detectors like at the airport. Being a germaphobe, this was pretty gross. Walking on the floor barefoot that hundreds of people walk on everyday and then putting your shoes back on. YUCKY! After that, there are monitors with the defendant's name that you are testifying against and the designated court room. You do your thing in court, go downstairs to collect the $25 for appearing and done. \n\nIt was pretty easy finding my way around since there were signs everywhere. The employees that I dealt with were just eh, not friendly but not rude either, which is to be expected in this sort of setting. One star docked for the parking and another star docked for getting the court times messed up. My subpoena said 8:45am but the monitor at the entrance said 9:30am, which meant I had more than an hour to kill. If your phone is dying like mine was, just go downstairs and people watch.

I really would recommend this place to everyone and have.  I do however have two issues: 1. The lack of variety of sides.  I feel like everything has the same side.  The salmon has broccoli only, for example. 2. The customer service there is so overbearing.  I feel so much pressure by the employees from the minute I walk in. The ask me how I'm doing, have I been there before, do I have any questions, do I need any recommendations, can they hold my food while I'm waiting, etc.  Despite the fact that I have been there several times, they still hound me. I feel the need to be rude to the just so I can take a minute and look around.  Or I just grab the salmon and blot to the register.  It's really an overwhelming feeling, my friends have mentioned it as well. I know they mean well but it would really be a much better atmosphere if they if they acknowledged me, ask if I needed anything and then stepped away. I'm sure people do have questions and would like information about the store, but those customers will present themselves.  Not every consumer needs to be pounced on when they walk in.  Ultimately though, the ease of having a healthy lunch in two minutes is worth putting up with the extraordinary customer service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BWHWlMbbfW2uuuZpmkWItg"}

He was charming, funny, interactive, doing shots of Crown Royale and of course, killin' it on the piano and on the mic.  Getting to know him and his brothers along with the folks who followed them has been a true pleasure and it was ultimately one of the coolest experiences we've ever had in Vegas.\n\nNowadays, Frankie has seriously blown up!  He's now a headliner at the Stratosphere where we absolutely cannot miss going to see them when in Vegas.  Every time we go, we bring new friends and family to see his amazing show including during the summer and for the first time this past year, we saw his New Years Eve show.  When you go to see the show, it's a given that you're going to be blown away by Frankie and the band who are so incredibly talented that they recently made headlines by singing on \"Dancing with the Stars\".  We recommend the show to everyone we talk to and I'm stoked to do the same on Yelp.  The only drawback would be the crowd itself.  Frankie thrives on an energetic, enthusiastic crowd.  If you're going in hopes of sitting there and snoozing, please don't bother!  But if you want to get outta your seat, hoot and holler and watch Frankie respond by climbing on his grand piano and belt out tunes backward, then this show is for you.  It's a mix of throwback Vegas Jazz, Rock, Pop and well-timed ballads.  Think Harry Connick Jr., Chris Isaac, Billy Joel and Jerry Lee Lewis all rolled into one.  And lets not forget those badass folks working the instruments behind him.  From Tony on Bass to Jennifer on the Violin, every single one of them are stoked to be up there playing to packed houses at the Strat multiple times a week.\n\nBTW, the show, while an amazing experience, can't be taken on the road with you.  So check out his album \"Frankie Moreno\" on iTunes, it's been a staple of my listening pleasure for well over a year.  I still have \"I'm Sorry\" and \"Never Mine\" in steady rotation on my iPhone playlists.  I think it would be really helpful to hear some of his original songs before you go to see him in person.  But no matter what, you're gonna dig the tunes, the atmosphere and the awesome vibe at the Frankie Moreno show at the Strat!", "type": "review", "business_id": "vcUWLglksRXSlfyUiTlIpQ"}

I have a great place that I will recommend (read my review about Portrait Innovations), however, I've been here twice and it got worse every visit.  \n\nThe first visit was for my maternity photos because my friend recommended this place (her photos are great) however mine was not.  The service was so-so, the sales person was that wanted to sell but she did take more than 30 shots.  When I received my photos they were all dark and we blended in the background but the proofs were completely the opposite.  \n\nOk so I let it go trying to give them benefit of the doubt.  \n\nSecond time was more than a year later for my son's 1st birthday photos.  This was really bad ~ the sales person is different from the last time and she was rudest person.  She rushed the pictorial and wouldn't allow a family shot because \"per company policy\" can only take 12-15 shots.  Bogus!! \n\nI bought the simplest package.

It's simple and well done with what certainly tastes like quality ingredients.  \n\nMy only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is the salt.  My soup and bruschetta were both heavily salted - you could see the layer of salt on the bruschetta - beyond my normal taste.  I don't tend to use much salt and would much rather add it myself.

Owned by one of the nicest and very successful local business owner.\n\nAnyway, after watching a great Saints vs. Lions game, I decided I was going to drop by for some pho (saw Lily's quick tip), but saw the grand opening banner for Woonam Jung. (Opened since Thursday, January 5, 2012)\n\nWow, what a pleasant surprise after some many years!  So I had to come check it out, even though I am not that hungry.\n\nThe hostess showed me to a table in the front of the restaurant.  And I was greeted by probably all of the wait staff, or at least three of them, a few minutes apart ready to take my order (in Korean).\n\nI tried a Galbi stew the last time I ate at a Korean restaurant, so I picked something similar to try here.  The Ugeoji Galbitang (Beef Rib Stew w/ Dried Cabbage) was flavorful and not too spicy.  The portion is large, easily sharable with 2 or more friends.  And it was served with steam rice mixed with some purple rice.\n\nWhile I was having my dinner, the owner spoke to my after he was done with a business meeting with a member of the local Chinese newspaper.  I learned that besides the newly opened Woonam Jung Korean Cuisine restaurant, he also owns the Koreantown Plaza, the food courts in Greenland Market, Lee's Travel Agency, as well as, (and you can probably guess if I ask you what other business) Lee's Discount Liquor.\n\nMr. Hae Un Lee, is a first class and all around nice and engaging man, who told me a brief history of how he came to Las Vegas 33 years ago; opened his first Lee's Discount Liquor store 30 years ago and grew it into the massive business empire it is today.  The conversation is like a big cherry to top dessert treat for me.\n\nAnyway, I will be back to try the Korean BBQ part of the menu in the next few days.  \n\n--Update--\n\nCame back for the Korean BBQ. Our group went with the seafood combination, which consisted of lobster tails, giant shrimps, calamari, and scallops.  If it is indeed 1 portion worth, instead of the 2x portion that we suspected it to be, then it is well worth it.\n\nThe non-prime marinated Galbi was delicious.  The most tender piece of galbi I have ever had the pleasure of eating, and it is thicker than what is typically served at other restaurants or what you can buy from Korean markets.  \n\nService was not as great as my first visit, but they were not slammed by the crowd of CES attendees using up their per diem.  Plus they were just wrapping up their first week of grand opening.  But I will still be back for more of the Galbi and seafood combination.\n\nService:  4.5/5  Very attentive. If you are Asian, you will likely be mistaken for Korean.  But their English is fairly good, so if your Korean conversation skills is nil, you will still get great service.\n\nFood:  4.5/5  Definitely going up against the other well-established local Korean restaurants.  The food was tasty and the default spiciness level is very mild, and can be dialed up as requested.\n\nDecor/Ambiance:  4.5/5.  Well lit, tastefully decorated.\n\nParking:  5/5  There are a lot of spaces on the side of Koreatown Plaza where Woonam Jung is located (between Pho Saigon and Tiffany's Coffee).\n\nI really like this place!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Qs_rxSL6BfBFzAr30VLeuw"}

I love dim sum, and I have been used to the best in Manila because of our proximity with China.  But when we moved here to Vegas, it's been quite a challenge looking for good dim sum.  Thanks to the suggestion of a dear friend, we've decided to give it a go.  The first thing you immediately notice is the vibrancy of the place.  High ceilings, uncrowded tables, red walls, soft lighting and very clean/crisp table cloths.  So often you see dim sum places pay little attention to details. (The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)  \n\nWe came early thinking to avoid the crazy rush hour which we did, but unfortunately could not order anything off the dim sum menu since the chef arrives at 11:15am.  Make sure you go after that time of you want to enjoy their fried rice, noodles or other entrees.  But you will have plenty to choose from the dim sum carts whizzing by - from congee/rice porridge with century egg, silken tofu, fried shrimp wantons, egg custards, taro cakes, pork buns and dumplings.  Our favorites were the steamed pork buns, hargaw or shrimp dumplings and the sweet spare ribs.  They tasted like they were all freshly made and although they still do not quite compare to the stuff we grew up with, esp from Binondo (Chinatown)... they are the best dim sum I've had so far in Vegas.\n\nIf I had one small quibble, it's that the soy sauce in their Kikkoman jars did not taste like Kikkoman.

They are fast, there are a lot of items to choose from, and from my experience here, they always got different things on the cart I haven't seen or tried. After grubbin' on some savory offerings, the dessert cart comes around and I grab my usual Rice Cakes and there are these buns with a white crunchy topping, so wifey asks about it and we find out they are Taro Buns. We get them, and it was love at first bite! They weren't real taro root though, it was purple sweet potato, and they were BOMB!\n\nAfter paying our bill and on our way out, I spied similar looking buns on a cart and asked the lady what they were...They also have Green Tea Buns too which is another excuse to return!

I really wanted to like this place. ...as I live close by.  I went there at 6pm on a Friday.  There was only 2 other tables sat in the place.  FYI, this place is basically just like the inside of any gas station, but it has some tables in one corner that they call a restaurant.  They have a sign that says \"please wait to be seated\",  I stood next to this sign for 10 minutes before some one walked by, and I had to stop them and ask \"How do I get seated?\" To which he replied, oh, I didn't see you.   I was with my wife and son,btw.  We get seated, and my 23 month old son is cranky, so I order a cup for him that I can put his milk in, and me and my wife order a water and a coke,  the waitress comes back with just my coke.  I ask again for the cup for my son, she then brings it.  i order fries just to have something quick to keep my son happy while we wait for our food and me and my wife get the caprese flat bread.  By the time someone else brings the food out, it is cold.  My son starts into the fries right away (which weren't bad despite being cold)  My wife and I try to eat the cold caprese flat bread and it was so bland, there was no balsamic vinaigrette that you normally get with a dish like this.  We have to grab her attention again to order our food, and order a side of balsamic vinaigrette.  After 20 minutes, with a cold uneaten caprese and fries almost depleted, i go up to the counter and request the vinaigrette again - she finally gives it to me, and we dump it on our cold soggy flat bread, which makes it about 1% better.  Another 30 minutes pass, My son has now finished the entire plate of fries, too full to eat any real food.  i go up to tell our waitress that we are going to need our food to go.  She says ok.  Minutes later, she walks up with our food on dishes, and sets a couple boxes down with it.  basically saying, i know the food was bad and late and you're had shitty service, but here, you can box it too.  This was the icing on the cake.  Bad food, horrendous service, bad atmosphere.

Frog), the \"Rabbit of Seville\" (where Elmer Fudd gets a \"haircut\" he will never forget), and the surreal \"Duck Amuck\" (where an animator with two long ears and a bushy tail torments Daffy Duck). \n\nSo the prospect of a museum dedicated to this man and his work, the Chuck Jones Experience at Circus Circus, had me writhing in anticipation from the moment I heard about it.\n\nThat anticipation dragged on for a few months, as every time a new opening date was announced, it was pushed back a month later, again and again. The Chuck Jones Experience just wasn't ready yet.\n\nUnfortunately, now that it finally is in full operation, it still feels unfinished and unready, and my initial excitement has quickly turned into disappointment.\nThe exhibit opens up with a small movie theatre that introduces you to Chuck Jones and his work through a number of film clips that seemed a bit grainy and dithered on the screen they were projected upon. It then leads you into his office where you can get a peek at his desk and peruse the bookshelf and the books that inspired him; this was one of the more interesting parts of the exhibit as I wondered how books like \"Cosmos\" by Carl Sagan, Francois Truffaut's interviews with \"Hitchcock\", and several books by Mark Twain might have influenced him throughout his career.\n\nThe next room explores how some of the more famous characters were designed and the \"rules\" animators needed to follow to ensure continuity. While there was a lot to see and absorb in this very small room, I started feeling a bit of dread as I was already halfway through this very short exhibit and had barely been in there 10 minutes.\n\nThe experience continues into one of its larger rooms that features scale models of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. While this room offers nothing more than a fun photo opportunity, it will probably be the most appealing to any children you might be dragging along with you, as the room that follows contains more pencil art, some actual scripts, a gallery of paintings, and an impressive wall listing each cartoon Chuck Jones has worked on, which kids will probably stare at for a second and quickly run past.\n\nWhile this gallery tries to cover the whole body of his work -- from early cartoon ideas, to his work on How the Grinch Stole Christmas, to a number of unique oils -- there are no real explanations as to what you are seeing. There are no cards explaining why Chuck Jones chose to parody Van Gogh's self portrait using a bandaged Wile E., when these painting were made, and whether they were created just for fun or commissioned by someone else. They're just there, hanging on the wall, their colorful and vibrant canvases merely an afterthought.\n\nThe next and final room of the experience might also appeal to children, as it tries to explain how cartoons are inked and painted, and how foley and sound effects are added to the soundtrack.This part of the exhibit could have been a lot more interesting and interactive if it followed the model used by the awesome Sounds Dangerous exhibit at Disney's Hollywood Studios in DisneyWorld, which is not much bigger than this exhibit, but so much better organized. Unfortunately, the foley \"stage\" was nothing more than a couple of computer workstations (equipped with a microphone, maraca and triangle), one of which was already out of order.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"ink and paint\" station was simply an electronic, on-screen coloring book that allowed you to color in the lines and nothing more, which might only appeal to children three years old and younger. Aside from a working zoetrope machine, this section of the exhibit did not touch upon animation's rich history: how thousands of individual drawings were traced with ink on celluloid, then hand painted, and then photographed one at a time. It fails to offer guests a way to experience that facet of the animation process (either with examples, a short film, or a guide) and appreciate the tools Chuck Jones had available to him in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, when some of his best cartoons were made.\n\nAnd that's pretty much the whole tour and \"experience\". Exit through the gift shop. Eh? What's up with that, doc?\n\nWhile the curators suggested the museum was still in its infancy and will be growing over the next few months, I would have preferred to wait a bit longer, even a whole year, and experienced something grander instead of being so disappointed by its meager content and slapdash atmosphere. Indeed, in its current state, this exhibit might only appeal to die-hard fans or burgeoning cartoonists who might appreciate some of the the scraggly notations Chuck Jones left on a few drawings and documents.\n\nAs Bugs Bunny might say: \"I knew I should have taken that left turn at Albuquerque.\" Maybe I could have avoided this mess.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l1fxjmVrTHOmYWVTuBQDpg"}

The service here was great! They were super nice and very friendly.  The only down side is that they don't seat you until your whole party gets there, which is fine but it got very crowded at the entrance and a little too crampy.  I am definitely coming here again.

I attended this fabulous event for the second year in a row, and was not disappointed at all. If anything, the festival has grown and if 75 different brewery vendors is not enough to wet your whistle, than you need to move on, my friend. I was encouraged to buy my ticket for the 2013 SBF well in advance, because all of the hopheads I know were certain the thing would sell out. I took my buddy Nate H.'s advice and got myself a VIP ticket which was only $10 more than the general admission ticket. VIP status also gets you in the gate an hour earlier than the main herd, which allows you to scope out the venue and pick and choose your battles wisely.\n\nThe weather couldn't have been more perfect. It was actually around 80F in the sun during the peak temperature (not terribly unheard of for Phoenix during February, but still a bit warmer than the average)! Fortunately, I bummed some sunblock off of some fellow light-rail passengers on the way to Steele Indian School Park, who were obviously planning on attending this event. These type of festivals lend themselves to some silliness, so I (and others) seem to make a great attempt to wear something unusual, if not something completely outlandish. This makes for a great icebreaker with fellow beer-drinkers who have caught their buzz earlier than anticipated (it is a STRONG beer festival... which lives up to its name) and feel the compulsion to comment on your odd wardrobe choice. Last year, I wore a Wienerschnitzel bowling shirt proudly declaring \"America's favorite wiener!\" and it was a hit. This year I settled on a fez embroidered with a biohazard symbol. I was happy to see that I did not spot one other person with a fez the whole day, so apparently I was an original.\n\nGlad to see that Arizona's craft beer scene is growing, as evidenced by the local vendors represented. I spotted a presence by SanTan, Papago, and Four Peaks, as well as relative newcomers Fate, THAT Brewery, and Desert Eagle. I also got to follow up with one of my old loves, Rubicon Brewing in Sacramento, which I sampled from the Pitcher of Nectar (distributors) tent. Rubicon's Black Capricorn Ale was a real treat, and I am so happy to see their distribution growing in AZ! I was also blown away by Bell's Brewing's (Michigan) Bourbon-barrel aged Batch 9000. At 14.8% abv, this propelled me to my peak happiness of the day.\n\nCheers to Old World for sponsoring the Beeraoke Tent and the ska band 2Tone Lizards who rocked the house.

Und zwar genau die Luxusversion \"Taste of Scotland\" mit einem 3-G\u00e4nge-Men\u00fc im angeschlossenen Restaurant \"Amber\" inklusive. Der Ablauf der Tour ist aber (ohne Dinner) mit der Platinum Tour identisch.\n\nMan wird von den Mitarbeitern sehr freundlich empfangen und dann gleich in ein Fa\u00df geleitet, da\u00df sich als Fahrger\u00e4t entpuppt. Mit diesem Fa\u00df f\u00e4hrt man durch eine virtuelle Destillerie, um den Herstellungsprozess eines Single Malts erkl\u00e4rt zu bekommen. Nach einer ca. 10 min\u00fctigen Fahrt empf\u00e4ngt der \"Tourguide\" die Teilnehmer in einem kleinen Raum, in der die Herstellung nochmal mithilfe von Gerste und Torf auch sensorisch gezeigt. Dann wurde auch die Bedeutung der Pot Stills und der F\u00e4sser erkl\u00e4rt.\n\nDanach kam es zum Wichtigsten Teil des Abends: das Tasting. In diesem Raum haben uns bereits gef\u00fcllte Nosing Gl\u00e4ser auf farbig markierten Punkten erwartet, daneben eine Karte mit den selben Farben, die mit den Regionen Speyside, Lowlands, Highlands und Islay beschriftet waren. Wir sollten dann unsere Nasen \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen und an den farbigen Teilen der Karten rubbeln und riechen, um den \"regionentypischen\" Geruch erfahren zu k\u00f6nnen. 2 Whiskies gab es dann zu probieren, aus den Highlands den Deanston und von Islay den Ardbeg. Dazu wurde uns der richtige Ablauf eines Tastings erkl\u00e4rt - sehen, riechen, schmecken.\n\nNach dem Tasting ging es weiter in die weltgr\u00f6\u00dfte Whiskysammlung, dort erwartete uns schon wieder ein Dram :) Die Whiskysammlung von Claive Vidiz umfasst um die 3500 Einzelflaschen Whisky.

I like the concept of green food, but I wasn't entirely impressed with any of the flavors. The meat was definitely tasty and fresh, you can tell. Although I wasn't in the mood for a burger so ended up ordering a grilled cheese with jalapenos. That was probably a mistake on my part. They have vegetarian and vegan patty options as well, which I'm intrigued by. \n\nThe fries were fresh, but I wasn't a fan of the flavor. I'm not typically a big fan of fries and these just weren't cutting it for me. Maybe I'm just too used to processed food, hopefully that's not the case. They have a great concept and maybe just need to work through the kinks. The service was definitely fantastic. We always had someone asking if we needed anything and asking if we were enjoying our meal. \n\nI don't know how motivated I am to go out of my way to return, but it's a good option if you're in the area.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UGlXDK8BKOZCroDTJ8nPKg"}

It's right off the 215 freeway and Decatur in North Vegas, just north of this new growing sin city suburb. I went on St. Patrick's Day, two weeks after the first day of Grand Opening, and customers were plenty. and plenty happy.  The woman in line ahead of us said that she's probably going to abandon Wal Mart and start coming here. Wal Mart, a few miles from here, so far has been very crowded but maybe that will change..\n\nIf you like size, variety, and a place to get a walk in while shopping, this box-like store without a membership is for you.  There will be almost 200 employees with new jobs, so that's good.  It's also 92,000 square feet, open 24 hours, is bright inside, and has things you don't find in discount stores, like grind your own peanut butter- though I didn't see that.  There were also bulk pet foods, lots of bulk candies and snacks, and brewed coffee samples next to the 20 or so bulk coffee varieties. On the down side, it's so big you things might be hard to find. I wasn't the only lost shopper, as others paced up and down looking for signs describing the aisle's items. Several minutes later, I found an employee with a list of items and their locations. And, you have to bag your own groceries, so in that sense, it's like a Food 4 less. Beware those shopping carts are giant,\nbig enough to put your St. Bernard in (dogs aren't allowed in the store, though!)\n\nSo you grab a huge cart, and notice the front door specials are nuts....well, it depends on the week but besides cheap peanuts this week, there were Cheerios for under $2.00, bacon for $2.99 a pound with no limit, and other low priced things like 3 twelve pack of Pepsi products for $10, etc.  It changes weekly.\n\nThen you step into the produce department, and find a decently stocked, colorful department including 5 varieties of apples for less than $2 a lb. Honeydew Melons are not much cheaper at 99 cents a pound than other places, though they even had some hard to find things like plums and nectarines from Chile for $2.50 a lb.  Not everything is cheap, but a lot of it is.  We didn't buy any meat today, but there were pretty good prices, definitely cheaper overall that Albertson's but more close to Wal Mart Neighborhood Market. There is also a Smith's a few miles from here, so the shopping choices are good for this hood. \n\nOverall, I'm a fan though stores like this hopefully don't get ghetto like most Wal Marts eventually do. When I visit relatives here again this summer when the temperatures are over 100 degrees, I'll be inside getting my exercise while shopping in the cool new store.\n\n.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0i8RMtxA4U2NM_8TDZSHsQ"}

My group did not really know them but, they are doing stuff for HBO and have some movies coming out. They were very good as well.\nThe club was very well kept and nice inside with Red Velvet curtains and red every where. With as many people in there it did not get hot at all.\nWell worth seeing.

We tried the buttermilk pancakes (oh so fluffy), Chef Dany's omelet (hubby's fav) and fennel omelet, mediterranean pie-meat (oven baked so not greasy), Daily Egg burger (love the fried egg with the burger). Chef Dany gave us the banana fritters as desert for free. Yummy and crunchy!for our last day we ordered to go Breakfast Sliders came in 4 buns super good and easy to eat while on the road.\nThe cafe is still new and staff and cook are still being trained but service and food cannot compare to your fast food chains and breakfas buffet.

He even pointed out things, like the neon light sculpture on the ceiling, that were particular to Steak. He made us feel welcomed.\n\nThe food:\nMy friend and I shared a Caesar salad. It was great. Just there perfect amount of dressing. the scotch egg was a treat.\nFor the main course there was a debate. I wanted the Beef Wellington and my friend wanted the Wellie and American Kobe Wagyu Beef Cap (she and I had never had that before.) We agreed to split our meat entries with each other. Well, after the first bite for each of us, we decided sharing was not going to work and gave each other a sliver of our steaks. The food was out of this world.\nFor desert we shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding. It was my friend's birthday and Anthony had a candle added to it. She felt very special.\n\nPrice - It's a steak house on the strip. It is not going to be cheap but for what was served and the service received it was worth it. It was about $130 per person including drinks (at $13 per x 4).\n\nI would recommend this restaurant as your fancy meal out when in Las Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mDdqifuTrfXAOfxiLMGu5Q"}

I'm one of those serial chop shop nail \"salons\" customers, so I'm used to being pushed out the door or having some say \"you pay now\" not \" I'm going to apply another layer because I think it will make the color look better\". Heck yeah! Oh and the \"extra time\" was nothing! Teres has these amazing UV lights that get the job done in 30 seconds, not 1-2 minutes!\n\nI love that they have tons of gel colors to choose from and the amount of glitter they have for a swag nail or just fancy nail art is overwhelmingly fun! They have an iPad up by the receptions for nail inspiration if you aren't sure about what you want. It has photos of previous customers fun nail designs. Thanks to Pinterest, I have quite the nail manicure folder at home and I brought the picture in that I wanted and Ashley made it happened with 100% accuracy!\n\nIt was also nice to be able to converse and understand what my nail tech was saying. She learned about my profession and recommended that my polish be applied with more layers to make the polish last longer. I'm already a week out and my nails look just like they did when I first left Teres. Usually my gel manicures last about five days max so I don't routinely get my nails done because it doesn't make any sense financially. However, Teres is only a couple more dollars more than those other nail shops I was venturing to and my manicure has already exceeded its life expectancy (in my mind) so I will definitely be back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "-YYlBL2gDXXIahbkayglvw"}

Morningside, Edinburgh.  No, not Morningside Place.  Morningside Park?  Are you not paying attention?  Morningside Road--a huge stretch, miles long, of small shops.  Cafes.  Restaurants.  Flower shops.  Lots of hairdressers for some reason.  Craft stores.  Art stores.  You could walk for hours and stop a hundred times...alas, you can only eat so many times, so I had to be choosy, taking photos of potential restaurants along the way.  Intermixed are churches, schools, and parks.  As you might have expected, being November in Scotland, it didn't rain...like I said often, rain occurs in those moments when I don't look in order to keep the landscape moist.  I bought an umbrella but never opened it.  \nAlthough eventually I would have to end my journey at a grocery store, I did need to slot in a lunch.  There were too many choices.  Chinese, Mexican, Indian, Nepalese, Japanese, Pub Fo--what...Nepalese?  Sold.  \nNOTE:  Yes, I understand that there MUST be at least one or two franchises on Morningside, but I was so distracted, I couldn't find them.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pM8Zbk4Cq1cyrPj-lswIYg"}

You order at the counter, get your food served on butcher paper and get as many slices of white or wheat bread as you desire. The brisket melts in your mouth, get the cutters choice. Moist, delicious, heaven. You can order by the slice or pound increaments - such as 1/4lb etc. The pulled pork and ribs are also amazing.

I did some research, grabbed a few quotes, and after all was said and done my gut told me JPG was the way to go. I knew this before even calling based off the information on their site and the glowing reviews here on yelp, and I'm now proud to add to that list for a number of reasons. \nMy experience goes a little like this...\n\nAfter my neighbors house was broken into on Tuesday during the day, I started doing some research on the matter that evening. Wednesday (yesterday afternoon) I decided it was time to give JPG a call to see how their services stacked up against, say a larger organization (who shall remain nameless.) I called into the number and was told Jim would call me back shortly thereafter to address my inquiry-- and that is exactly what happened. Within minutes, a pleasant sounding voice came across the phone introducing himself to me as Jim, one of the owners of the company. What really stood out to me was that Jim recognized the importance of moving fast on getting this installed so I could feel secure--so much so that he was willing to give me a quote and set me up right over the phone. Jim would have met me in person no problem, and he made this well-known, but because he was booked on the day (today) I worked from home when that could happen, he wanted to be sure that when I was working from home I could jump right into the installation instead. \n\nI'm all about meeting someone in person for a general inquiry so they can scope out my house and offer their professional opinion, but in this instance I really appreciated Jim doing this for me within minutes over the phone so that I could move forward with the process and have a system installed as soon as possible. He didn't ask for my email (so that he could blow up my email with solicitations like some other companies had.) I just gave him the information he needed about my house description--what I was looking for in terms of services--and he called me back within minutes with not one but two separate quotes for plans since I was initially unsure which to go with at first. I had found in talking with other companies that there was a lot of talk before the numbers came out about pricing, but Jim understood I was merely at that point looking for a quote and got straight to the point. Also, what they said about, \"No up front fees\" is absolutely true. I paid nothing for the install. The only payment to be made is simply the month fee for the monitoring service, which by the way is extremely competitive compared to the other companies I looked into. I am very happy with the price I will pay for peace of mind. The other really cool item they feature addresses the, \"Crash and smash\" technique robbers use. Many of the people who I know that have been robbed have had their doors kicked in. With this cell system I really do feel confident that robbers will have little to no time in my house if/once they get in because the alarm (when enabled) immediately goes off and will dial out to my cell and keep me informed. Either way--whether I answer and say, \"No one should be home please dispatch immediately\" or not answer at all--the local enforcement will be made aware. \n\nI also have to commend my installation technician today, Nick. He arrived during the expected window hour of time and was extremely helpful, friendly, and knew his stuff. He made sure I was okay with any and every change he'd have to alter on the windows and in installing the control panel in an area that would serve me best. He made it a point to clean up after himself and try to not disturb me as I worked from home. I could really tell he valued a a person's privacy and he was extremely professional. Nick informed me that, because he has seen the in's and out's of my house, that for security he will be the technician account handler for my house and, if not him, his boss. I really liked hearing that, that JPG would value someone's personal privacy by assigning them to one person they could get to know and trust. \n\nOverall, my experience with the company has been awesome. I think all of these reviews really do speak for themselves and I'd recommend these guys to anyone looking for a system that's secure and up to today's standards in technical know-how with break-in cases. Their customer service has superseded my expectations by far. Lastly, one nice thing I enjoyed hearing from them is that if you ever move, they can and will move with you if it's here in the US (in basically every state but Hawaii and Alaska I believe.) I was a little concerned about that initially because they came off as a local company solely, but that is definitely not the case. Just thought I might mention that for those of you that are considering larger, less mom-and-pop type of companies.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tAdd__IgXQEknDDicEbRgQ"}

My poor step dad didnt get to enjoy much of his meal because the rest of us defaulted to his plate because we couldnt stand the saltiness of our meals.\n\nIt didnt seem so much of an over-seasoning of a single plate or a mistake made in the kitchen, but that their food/seasoning is just crazy-salty. \n\nAnd to ice that with a $96.00 bill where none of us even ordered an alcoholic beverage....no thank you. I wont be returning. Sad too because it really does seem like a fun place, but...this is Vegas...", "type": "review", "business_id": "VdY6qe9afspFwsbzX1HsOQ"}

Over the past 10 years I have had at least one a/c company at my house per year (mainly for the nasty summer tune up that we all need).  This company was OUTSTANDING - and I don't say that easily.  They were at our house within 24 hours of me calling.  Even better, they weren't supposed to show up until the early afternoon hours, but knew I was in a time crunch and they got there in the morning instead (now that's unheard of!).   The tech was professional, and very nice - as I was home with my kids I didn't feel awkward letting him into my home (something that I cherish as I have had some really scummy A/C techs come out before).  He was very knowledgeable about his service and took the time to answer my (probably asinine) questions.  \n\nTheir prices were fantastic!  And the best part - they diagnosed the problem quickly, and actually FIXED it without trying to sell me anything (again, when the heck does this happen?!?!?!!!).  This is the first AC company we have had that came out and didn't tell us our system was too old and try to sell us a new one. These kind of AC companies are hard to find in Phoenix. We will use them in the future and I highly recommend them.", "type": "review", "business_id": "y5iWYeNtFNRzUHJPDRfEgg"}

My first impression upon entering was that this place is ghetto.  They had couches and 8 or 10 barber chairs.  Everything seemed run down.  Most of the leather was cracked.  Hip hop played on the radio.  I chose not to judge the book by its cover and give it a try.  Only three barbers were working.  There was no check-in station.  A barber called me over and we began.  My barber, Cal, worked quickly but did a good job.  He seemed like a cool guy.  I did not like how they used compressed air to blow the hair pieces off your head and shoulders.  It was too loud and made my ears ring.  All stations had that set up so I assume it is standard practice there.  Cal said the place has been open for seven years.  Cal told me about several celebrities that get their hair cut there.  The cut was $15 before tip.  I felt like I got my money's worth.  I would go back, but I prefer a different atmosphere.  I'm not suggesting that they change their style.  That is their niche.  If you like the \"thug life\" atmosphere and hip-hop haircuts than this joint is for you.

I always worry about parking in Scottsdale but there are a number of parking lots close by so no problem there.\n\nA pleasant (and attractive) young lady met us out front and held the door for us. The hostess and servers were friendly and attentive.  My wife had pasta and I had a build your own burger. The pasta and burger were very good and I recommend them.\n\nBut back to the wings. We placed our drink order and Tina recommended that we order the chicken wings for an appetizer. Now here's the thing...I am from Western New York. My family is from Buffalo, NY and I grew up on a steady diet of chicken wings from local pizza joints and bars. I know chicken wings. I know how they are supposed to taste and I know how they are supposed to be served and I also know that when you get more then 100 miles  from Buffalo, NY nobody (and I mean nobody!!) knows how to make a decent chicken wing. Now, Tina knows that I have been, hmmm.....whats the correct phrase....unimpressed by the wings in Phoenix. Overall, the wings in Phoenix suck. They suck badly. They are suck-o-rama. They don't know jack squat about making wings in Phoenix. Tina knows my feelings about the wings out here yet she still suggested we try the wings. I made a face but we did it anyway and much to my surprise...\n\nRehab figured it out.!!! My wife doesn't like blazing hot wings (I do) so we ordered the medium wings and they were SPECTACULAR. Deep fried perfectly, crispy but not over done and covered in a tasty medium hotsauce.  I love my wings in a pool of sauce and these bad boys were swimming!\n\nAnother thing Rehab does right is they serve their wings with carrots (no celery though!?!) and blue cheese. This is one of the simplest and most basic things about AUTHENTIC buffalo style chicken wings yet for some reason when you get out of Western NY no one understands this. Veggies and blue cheese...whats so difficult about that?\n\nSo overall we had drinks, wings, a burger and pasta, and with tip we still walked out for about $60. Good prices, good food, good service, GREAT wings, and not a hint of Scottsdale snootiness!", "type": "review", "business_id": "v7OwbHgNgy_VQ9eP5FjvUA"}

My friend ordered her chili hatch  burger cooked medium and it was served rare. She did not notice until I did and was so hungry that she decided to eat it and  only bring it to the server's attention versus complain.\n\nI had the grilled chicken sandwich and it came piled high on \"Beach\" toast with layers of avocado, tomato, havarti cheese and sprouts...it was a delicious monster of flavors and came with sweet tater tots (you also have the choice of french fries) which were to die for. Shame on me,  I also ordered a chocolate lava shake which was delicious and not too sweet. The shake was served in a tall glass topped with whipped cream and M&M's.\n\nThe restaurant itself is not pretentious at all and rather casual in atmosphere sporting surfboards against the wall and cycles hanging from the ceiling.\n\nOverall, it was a nice experience, a good discovery and a nice change from the other burger joints. I enjoyed the fact that RBT is more of a sit down place versus standing in line to have to order your food. It's also nice that the burgers and sandwiches come with a choice of fries versus having to pay extra for them. The restaurant also has a full bar and a heated patio.", "type": "review", "business_id": "v7OwbHgNgy_VQ9eP5FjvUA"}

If you are looking for an awesome burger in a fun filled place with great service then this is the place! Came here with a couple of friends for lunch on our continual quest for the \"perfect burger\" and we might have found it! I had the Bacon and Blue Burger on pretzel bun and it was awesome! The bacon and blue cheese is infused into the meat and it was so juicy that I needed the three extra napkins the waitress brought me. I had the Jamaican corn as the side and it was delicious! Another friend had the Mushroom Swiss and it was delicious as well. As were the sweet potato tots that came with it. Although we were totally stuffed from our burgers we had to try the \"Pot Brownies\" that I got a coupon for when checking in with Yelp. And we were so glad we did! A hot brownie with layers of marshmallow fluff, peanut butter cup, vanilla ice cream, and chocolate sauce - can you say divine?!  Our server was fantastic and the place has a great vibe! Will definitely be back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "v7OwbHgNgy_VQ9eP5FjvUA"}

Over all the staff was great! Two thumbs up. How ever the food was okay, they gave us the wrong flat bread & when told they let us have the wrong one to munch on (we were starving!) and made the correct one - I think, it said pork belly was on it but it looked more like brisket. They also gave us some Carmel popcorn (the best part of the meal! Then at the end we ordered 2 cappuccinos but they were clearly espresso with no milk, and had to request half and half to go with it. So in short- okay food, excellent service, with some hiccups that were addressed extremely graciously.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kr3EFhoSwbJPrL_e_RD39g"}

We walked in and got seated right away in the \"patio\" LOL which is actually just a space that is right by the casino. We got waters and after checking yelp, we got a free yelp check in of spring rolls!!! ....but they were not spring rolls, they were eggrolls\n\nAnyways, for an establishment that is in Vegas, I did not want to try anything Asian on the menu ... because they would probably butcher it.. I got the breakfast burrito which came with a side of green verde sauce and sour cream. My friends got the wonton noodle soup, Chicken club sandwich, and the chow fun. The breakfast burrito was very hearty and pretty good but i only finished half! My friend said the wonton noodle soup was okay but it looked like it barely gave her any noodles just a lot of soup. The chow fun actually looked pretty good from where i was sitting but my friend said it was just alright and he finished all of it! The chicken club tasted fresh and the fries were crispy.\n\nMost of the stars are for the very friendly staff who tried to accommodate us as much as they could. Our waiter told us that we were welcome back anytime and that they were open 24/7 and breakfast started at 5:30am.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zj_cfXL3H2OmZHVYYrNI2Q"}
